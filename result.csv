I do not cover the story here, but I will say I love it and it's best experiencing it blind!)\n\nThe past few years, mostly after Mania/Forces, have been pretty cut-and-dry in regards to truly standout game releases, Mania was honestly the last time I felt absolutely giddy about a Sonic game, and that was in 2017, plus we all know what happened with Forces and the effect it left on fans, which I still think is pretty dumb, but I won't get sidetracked about that. Point is, I'm happy to say that Sonic Frontiers reignited that feeling once again in its own way. I've played through the campaign and 100%'d it in about 21 hours, and I can confidently say that this is definitely one of the most fun and enjoyable Sonic games I've played in quite some time, although like many games, it ain't a perfect 10.\n\n\n\nFirst off, the islands, or 'open zones' as the devs love to call it. The game is split into 4 islands (Kronos, Ares, Chaos, and Ouranos), with 1 additional area (Rhea) used primarily for story beats. The open-zone gameloop consists mainly of you exploring around as Sonic, with most of his abilities from past games, with the goal of collecting several different important items to advance to the next objective, and you can handle this goal in a multitude of different ways. There are character memory tokens which are used to progress through the 'side-stories' of each island's respective character, Portal Gears that you obtain from the Guardian minibosses, and Vault Keys, which you mainly get from 'Cyberspace' levels, they're the big important m'guffins that unlock each of the 7 Chaos Emeralds. The gameloop can be considered repetitive to some, but I'd say the campaign manages pretty fine with it, since you're often doing different things along the way in each island whilst pursuing the goal. Sonic's controls in the open-zone are GODLIKE, and they honestly trounce over every single Boost game by a long shot, even the really good ones. It helps that it's also customisable with different sliders in the game settings, however I cranked them up to the max, and still, Sonic felt super good to control. He also has extra moves like Mania's drop dash (which has slope momentum wowww we can shut up about it now!!), and even somewhat of a return of the bounce bracelet from SA2. There's also a few minigames that you do in these open-zones to advance the story, there are some which are okay, like those space-shooter sections, and some that are REALLY bad, like Chaos Island's pinball minigame. I wish some of these weren't really mandatory, or at least made less egregious as it kinda pulls a 'Wrath of Cortex' by making you play this completely different gameplay style to get back to the open-world action platformer you paid money for, and that's not something I like very much in games like this. There is also the glaring issue with pop-in, which while expected from an open-world game, I feel the devs could've worked to make it less jarring, or increase the distance a fair bit to mask it better. I do hope a patch comes out at some point to address that issue, as it can be pretty distracting on occasion.\n\nTo end this on a lighter note though, I'd say Ares is my favourite of the islands due to the amount of content it houses, as well as it having some of my personal highlights in this game's story. It's funny cuz usually, I don't like deserts in a lot of games!\n\n\n\nThe open zone also features combat, which we haven't seen in the main series since the Werehog in Unleashed. While I know the Werehog has its fans, I personally didn't find it all that enjoyable, considering you had to just rely on QTEs for a good ranking making all the actual combinations pointless. Frontiers on the other hand, has a pretty fun skill tree-based combat system that while simple, is REALLY accessible to anyone and fun to utilise when you get good with it, making you feel like you're pullin' off ♥♥♥♥ on the level of a DBZ character, it's cathartic as hell and I love it. I also liked how most of the enemies were handled in this game, especially the Guardian minibosses. You have to put together different strategies to even earn the privilege of wailing on them with your crazy moves, the Sumo fight is a pretty good example of what I mean.\n\nAnd the SUPER SONIC TITAN BOSSES AT THE END OF EACH ISLAND? Oh my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GOD, they are EASILY the best fights with Super Sonic that this series has had in such a long time, and a perfect example of how rewarding the combat is in this game when you know how to get good at it! My only gripe though is that the parry system in this game, while I understand why, is way too easy to abuse, as you only need to hold the bumpers down and nothing else, that and you can just stall yourself in the air with it indefinitely which is kind of strange, but that can honestly just be amounted to the fact that I'd love to have a bit more challenge in this game. Not on the level of something like the Souls games duh, but just something to encourage me to be a LOT more methodical with my approach to new threats.\n\n\n\nNow for the arguably weakest part of this game. Cyber Space. These are basically the last hurrah of the Boost formula from Unleashed, Colors, Gens and Forces, being bite-sized levels (with the occasional long one) that almost feel like Special Stages in some form, and they're often the main way of earning Emerald Vault Keys. The idea of small boost levels as little challenge stages is a great idea and honestly worth keeping so that traditional Sonic stage gameplay can be preserved in some form in this new age and new formula, but Frontiers' execution of this idea could've been handled a lot better in my eyes.\n\nFirst off, the controls. They are not as smooth as the open zone, which while I understand the sliders can change a lot, the way they made Sonic control in these stages is so jarring in comparison, his turning arguably being worse here than in Forces which was pretty bad to begin with.\n\nSecondly, the aesthetics. Everyone has harped on for a while about how sick they are of the levels from the classic games constantly being used in recent games since Gens, e.g. GHZ, CPZ, SSZ. I personally never cared for it, but I can understand when it's tiring to see the same thing over and over again. There WAS one original aesthetic though in this game, which was the highway theme, and I loved all of those and wished they had more spotlight, as I don't think you see them as much as the other three.\n\nThirdly, some of the level designs themselves. Some of the level designs they picked were pretty fun to go through, like the Sky Rail and Green Forest homages, but there were some major stinkers as well, like 1-2 for his inconsistently strict S rank time, or 3-6, which was basically themed after one of those REALLY hard Unleashed DLC levels, I had to replay several times to get the S on that one.\n\nFor the future, if they plan on exploring this idea again which I hope they do, I'm not too fussed about them using past level designs, but it's not as fun going through them with a Sonic that doesn't control as greatly as he did back when those old level designs were new in their debut games. I'd also say expand on the varying aesthetics. Four themes is such a small range for such an amazing concept.\n\n\n\nOverall, this game's a strong 8.5/10 for me. This is a great first shot at a new formula, and I hope to look forward to future games with this new foundation in mind. Damn good job, Sonic Team, you pulled through."", '(I had to cut this review down a bit because it was too long to post why do I care about this stupid blue rodent so much)\nStory/Writing: 8/10.\nWhere they make up in a decent overarching story is the phenomenal character writing that makes these characters feel REAL. Sonic isn\'t just a ♥♥♥♥, tails isn\'t just smart, amy isn\'t just girl, knuckles isn\'t just dumb.\nSonic is still snarky, but he cares for his friends, he\'s upbeat, he\'s honestly also just funny. Amy is a caring soul filled with love for everything, wanting to just see love bloom for others. Knuckles is stoic, a true warrior, last of the echidnas and honorable enough to lead his own army to get out of his cyber cage. Tails is growing up, he doubts himself, he wants to be more all because of his strong bond with his best friend.\nEggman has my favorite glowup. I\'ve hated how eggman started to get portrayed in the games, he wasn\'t the evil genius he was supposed to be, he was dumbed down, and made the butt of a joke because you knew he was supposed to lose at the end. But in frontiers, he has his wits, intellect, and a perfect touch of his arrogant self we\'re used to. His brains shine here and prove that Dr. Robotnik is more than just an inventor, he\'s a mastermind (I recommend reading through all the egg memos you get from the fishing shop, they provide excellent lore, have eggman speaking in a reserved tone all voice beautifully by the great Mike Pollock, and show Eggman\'s true colors as not just a villain, but as a person.)\n\nVoice acting: 9/10.\nEveryone did so good, this is the best Roger has sounded as sonic and honestly might be my favorite deliveries and writing for sonic yet. Amy could\'ve used work, but everyone else did a fantastic job. The voice direction, despite being odd at first, was really easy for me to warm up to and I adored every single character interaction in the game, with the sonic and knuckles interactions being a personal highlight.\n\nMusic: 10/10.\nIt\'s sonic music. It\'s always great. The music always fits the tone of whats going on. The tranquil and calm music of the overworld (And the fishing theme, which is my favorite song), the upbeat EDM and dubstep of cyberspace levels, and the insanely hard metal for the super sonic themes. All of them shine in their own way and I had the game cranked up to max the entire playthrough.\n\nGameplay (Open World): 6/10.\nWhile sonic himself controls amazingly, some of the decisions with the cyloop, rings, and collectibles confused me, as well as combat being iffy at times. Sonic feels smooth, he stops on a dime which is exactly what you need in an open world game, no sliding, precision is key and it\'s found here.\nHowever the actual design of the open worlds, while amazing to run around in, felt like a lot of it was just thrown in there. I would\'ve liked more challenges or actual terrain objectives instead of just floating platforms and grind rails, It would\'ve been amazing to run up a giant pillar in a short amount of time, or run along the ceiling and walls of a cave to go through a bunch of rings in a few seconds or something, but every ""World Challenge"" felt very samey. The cyloop, while fun, had little to no depth despite how much it was used. It was always just ""Make a circle here, congrats challenge completed"". It also confuses me with how many rings were put in the overworld, with the cyloop granting you an infinite amount of rings for just running in circles, it felt odd for any rings to be in the overworld at all, as there never really was a moment where I wasn\'t at max rings from just running in circles. Collectibles like the lost kocos kinda felt like they were just scattered and thrown about, with there being no reason to collect them or any other collectibles due to the cyloop and fishing minigame giving you everything you would ever need. The open worlds were beautiful and fun to run around in, but lacked depth.\nCombat as well also felt very shallow. You can get through any encounter by mashing and then just doing a cyloop or pressing parry when you need to. Some combat also felt buggy, while overall it felt nice, snappy, and responsive, the fact that they mapped every special move to only 3 button combinations made it so I would constantly be using the wrong moves just because I tapped R2 once.\n\nGameplay (Cyberspace): 8/10.\nAll of the original levels, if I can even call them that, felt more like missions or challenges that you would find in previous sonic games, where they cut out a small portion of a level. But the ones that are just flatout taken from past games, despite being nothing new, still feel like gold and that\'s due to the new way sonic feels in frontiers.\nSonic is much slower in cyberspace, which is felt way more in the 2d sections, however I\'m all for this. Boosting is now on an infinite and regenerating meter, but as a trade-off, it\'s much slower and no longer makes sonic blast through enemies. It\'s no longer a boost and is now more like a dash, but this feels much better than the uncontrollable speeds he could reach with the boost from unleashed, generations, and forces. The game feels like a proper platformer now. The magnet dash is a great new technique as well, which can send you flying through levels at immense speed, with the risk of you accidentally hitting an enemy, spikes, or falling off the level entirely if you aren\'t careful.\nDespite some of the length of the levels, some of them can be incredibly challenging. One level took me 40 minutes to beat, but by the end of it, I felt proud of being able to achieve a time that was over a full minute better than the S rank requirements. However the opposite is also true, with some levels being far too easy, short, and were trivial to achieve an S rank.\nCyberspace was hit or miss. Old levels felt amazing all the way from SA2 to Generations re-treads. New levels could also be fun, but could feel hollow.\n\nVisuals: 5/10\nI was very disappointed with how the overworld looked. The environments looked great, but pop-in was far too distracting, with platforms just appearing out of thin air no matter how close or far away you are from them.\nIn cyberspace, while pop-in is no issue, each level was only 1 of 4 possible styles. A green hill zone style, sky sanctuary style, City style like in radical highway or speed highway, and a Chemical Plant style. Sometimes they would have a slight orange filter, signifying the evening, but they still all felt identical. This is especially a problem in the post-game arcade mode level select, in which you can play each level freely, however these levels are merely given ""1-1"" type names, and all look the same from the previews, meaning you have to look through levels, sometimes entering and leaving levels just to confirm whether or not it was the right one. Not a single cyberspace level was visually pleasing or interesting.\nThe character models are the best part of the visuals. Sonic looks so expressive, and while the lip sync isn\'t amazing, I can forgive that due to the faces of each characters being able to show much more emotion than before. Sonic has the emotion that he hasn\'t been able to show in-game and was only ever seen in artwork and the comics.\n\nSummary:\nAny sonic fan will adore this game. It\'s fun, charming, engaging, and a real damn treat, after these past few dull years of 3d sonic. Is it better than mania? I can\'t say,the games are too different to compare. This really felt like it\'s own product rather than just ""We\'re trying to do generations again but failed"" (cough cough Sonic Forces). Highly recommended to anyone familiar with sonic up to this point, especially someone with lore knowledge as the cutscenes were really rewarding to those who care about the story of this little blue rodent. As a starting point? While I\'ll still recommend it, I believe it doesn\'t serve as a good introduction to the series, as it relies far too heavily on old references, level design, and knowledge of how old boost games played.', ""So.. Sonic frontiers. I have a lot to say about this title and gonna be honest? It's a good game, but could've been better, but I feel like SEGA and sonic team tried to rush this for the holidays which isn't anything surprising since sales do better during that time period but it does hinder the overall experience.\n\nNow let's go by one thing at a time. First, the islands/hub world. I think it's the best part of this game, the second one being my favorite out of the bunch and I REALLY wish they've done more with the islands because I can see the potential with what they have, I really think them saying this game is 'open world' is a bit misleading, I would say it's a more of a 'sandbox' kind of game. Basically think about it like how mario odyssey is, large open levels that you can explore and go collecting moons. That's how frontiers is approached, with that type of game philosophy. But now with that in mind, what they have is good, even with the weird pop ins here and there but I felt like they've could've expand it more by adding more variety than just oh here's the platforms and the rails. I wanted to so that you can BUILD the islands to traverse through, the puzzles SORT OF do that, but they only add rails and reveal the map. It would've been cool if as you progressed through the story or do the cyberspace levels, you add onto more of the map. Because you can have so much fun with the hub worlds, I had a fun time just blast through the place with what they had and hell, I felt like I was playing sonic adventure 1 with the amount of speed you can have, especially if you get it juuust right and you ZOOM towards where you want to head. It's easily my favorite part of the game\n\nSecond, the combat and enemies. I will admit, the combat is pretty repetitive and can be pretty brain dead if you want to just spam the attack button but since you actually have moves now, you can be flashy with what you wanna pull off. Sure it's sometimes a simple 'hold this or press this' and you can do the move, but it's more of the flashiness of it and seeing sonic perform these moves makes it so cool, but I do wish they could've expand on the combat more because I do see some lost potential in there, since it is pretty easy to make it out before you're even at the mid point of the game. As for the enemies? The variety is there and I do enjoy what they have, the mini bosses on the hub world are pretty entertaining and as the more fodder enemies they fit what island they're from. But where the game really shines? The titans, they are so fricking cool, just seeing super sonic handle a fricking evangelion unit while having some kickass music blasting. Easily the highlight of the bosses and does make use of the combat a lot better than the mini bosses, but they're also pretty easy for the most part. Since all of have to do is get close enough and go ham on them but I think what makes people go crazy is when you finish them off. They're so good, my personal favorite being the third island again. I won't spoil it any further, but once you see it- You'll feel like a little kid again.\n\nThe Cyberspace levels and controls; The controls are. The controls feel janky in this title, especially if you're going from generations - forces - frontiers; like for example, the boosting is tweaked so that you aren't so ridiculously fast like in generations but when you jump you basically lose all momentum, especially if you try to air boost. The air boosting got nerfed in this title, so you can't use it that much anymore and the homing attack has this delay on it so you can consistently homing attack anymore; but it does have a nice perk to it. It's called homing attack cancel, basically cancelling a homing attack to a boost and BOY DOES THAT GIVE YOU A LOT OF MOMENTUM REAL QUICK. It's a lot of fun if you get it down consistently. But then here comes the worst part of the game; the Cyberspace levels, now I get that they're supposed to be from Sonic's memories but they are so short. It has the forces problem where the level ends before it can even start, and it's no different here. I can honest to god name like only two levels that are only past the 2;30 mark but even then that's pretty short compared to what we had previously. And you feel so slow when you try to not boost since also the boost now has a meter that isn't charged by rings anymore or destroying badniks. I can get their intentions with the Cyberspace levels; bite sized tradition levels but I honest to god wish that they didn't do that and instead made it so that the levels felt like actual levels instead of it suffering like forces and ending before it begins. The only thing that carries the Cyberspace levels is the music but other than that, I can't say that I didn't enjoy the levels but there is a lot missing that makes you feel empty.\n\nStory, VAs and Music; Now I know people have a history of hating Ian Flynn but I do think he did the characters much needed justice by actually making them characters in the story. They don't feel so one sided anymore and actually show that they DO have faults and acknowledge their mistakes. Sure some of the dialogue is a bit awkward but this game has done them much more justice than the past decade, especially sonic. Sonic's no longer a snarky guy who's constantly spouting one liners. I feel he's back to his former self with how they portray him. And I do think that the voice actors did a good job, especially Roger and Mike. It was weird at first hearing a more deeper voice of Sonic but it did fit with this setting that the game chose. And the eggman codecs? They were VERY JUICY and I feel like mike has sold it in that as well. Amy's voice actor sounds flat a lot of times but I did she did okay, Tails is on the same levels as Amy's VA but she was less awkward with voicing tails and the interactions felt much better than Amys, as for knuckles? I think he did a good job too, especially with the small interactions he has with sonic. They were very good, Sage's VA was pretty monotone but given that she's an AI and all? I think she did a great job with what she had. Now the story- Well... I can say it did more than the previous titles, like the mystery with the ancients was there and it made me think like I couldn't believe there was some EVEN before the echidnas and whatnot and I desperately wished that they've gone more in depth with it because Sage as a villain- She didn't REALLY do anything other than tell sonic he was going to fail on his quest and it shows as near the end of the game I can tell the game was just rushing for the ending. Spoilers for the ending of the game here! But enough about that. Now time for the music- I really enjoyed the tracks they had! Too bad for most it was short due to the cyberspace levels, but at least we had the fishing and titans. God I love the titan's songs so much.\n\nFinal thoughts; This game is a 7.5/10. This game could've been great but it was rushed, now would I pay 60$ for it? Nah. Definitely get it on a sale, but I do recommend on giving this game a try. And if you like it, that's good and if ya don't? that's okay. But definitely looking forward to what sega has to offer in store in the next title.""]"
1,0,303,0_frontiers_sonic_game_levels,"['frontiers', 'sonic', 'game', 'levels', 'like', 'open', 'games', 'just', 'story', 'time']","[""Sonic Frontiers is one of THE games ever made!\n\nOverall, I recommend buying this game, especially if you're already a starved Sonic fan, assuming you still give a ♥♥♥♥ about this series somehow. If you're not already a fan, perhaps wait for a sale. I do believe £50 is pricey when you compare this title to similar games both on and outside of Steam. Just keep your expectations in check. The high points are amazing, but man do the lows suck ass.\n\nIn a number rating, I'd just BARELY give this game a 7/10. It would be a 6 if not for the context that this is the first GOOD 3D Sonic game in over a DECADE now, and I greatly respect Sonic Team for actually having some ambition like the old days. Despite 5 years of development, it is clear they had many troubles making this after needing to scrap everything and start over. This game IS unfinished, it's obvious especially later in the game, but despite everything, I still love, and more importantly, respect what this game turned out to be in the end, again given the greater context of Sonic's game history.\n\nHere's a rough list of things I liked and didn't like from the top of my head, some points include spoilers:\n\n-- Liked --\n- The writing is some of the best in the series. Nothing groundbreaking for the writing world, but for Sonic it's a massive step up. There are various scenes in the world where he can talk with his friends in ways you'd actually believe to make sense. Crazy! I do wish more was happening during these moments outside of just standing around and talking, but it's a start.\n\n- The boss fights. With the exception of the final 2, they rule. Don't spoil yourself on them. Just play them.\n\n- I do believe the combat is serviceable, I just wished for something more involved.\n\n- The music. No ♥♥♥♥ the music is amazing, it's Sonic. Again I must point to the boss fights as those tracks go HARD. It's ridiculous but I love it.\n\n- A lot of people don't like these, but I actually liked the Cyberspace levels overall, but I would change a lot about them. I think S ranks need to be FAR harder to achieve, the red rings should actually take effort to find, and the controls should be IDENTICAL to the open world controls. For some reason, Sonic's physics are completely different in Cyberspace in all the worst ways. I understand why they are disliked, primarily for the fact they are in every way WORSE than Unleashed and Generations levels, but I still had plenty of fun with these. Still better than Forces lmao.\n\n- Fishing! :D\n\n- There's a lot of sections where you'll be playing some kind of mini-game to beat a challenge. Random world challenges do this and so do some guardian fights. Some will likely hate this but I ended up really enjoying it, with the exception of one instance seen in the dislikes list. Overall is really reminds me of Nier Automata.\n\n-- Disliked --\n- The open world level design is bland and boring. Still fun to run around in, but I'm not a fan of the massive disconnect between the world geometry and all the random rails and boosters everywhere. It just looks kinda bad and doesn't make any sense.\n- On the topic of the open worlds, Chaos Island, the third island in the game. It. Is. BAD. The game often locks you into predefined paths that are more like traditional Sonic platforming challenges. That's what those rails and springs are. But it's HORRIBLE in Chaos Island. Hard to see, or outright HIDDEN booster pads sending you in a completely different direction, locking you into a 2D section you can't escape from, and when you try to frantically get out, you hit ANOTHER one. It's not this bad for the other worlds, Chaos Island is just by far the worst in the game. The boss rules though.\n\n- Graphical issues. The game ran fine for me, but the pop in is awful. I was hoping for an option to reduce it on PC but n o p e. It very often disrupts gameplay too, as platform challenges RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU can sometimes not load in visually, so you can't see where you need to go. Remember you travel quite fast in this game too. Not a good mix as you can imagine.\n\n- Invisible walls. WHY????? Open world game locking off large chunks of the map for no reason. OK.\n\n- Ignore this point if you REALLY want to see the true final boss completely blind, but it sucks ass anyway so you shouldn't care tbh. The final boss is awful. Minor gameplay spoiler here, not story related. The gameplay of the true final boss is nothing like the rest of the game. You go from Sonic to TouHou for no reason at all. I like bullet hell shoot-em-ups, but ♥♥♥♥ this. It isn't even cool to look at. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SPHERE. Not to mention the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ monologue it goes on every time you fight it, and if you lose, back to the beginning! It's long and annoying and uninteresting as hell. Terrible way to end the game when you have so many kickass Titan fights.\n\n- This game's physics are janky as hell. I fairly often clipped through the geometry of some guardians and titans. Sonic just randomly decides whether he feels like sticking to the floor like a magnet, or just being launched into the air. The wall running sections are extremely inconsistent. Sometimes he sticks automatically, sometimes you need to hold the boost button just to run normally, sometimes the boost actually boosts and launches you off the wall, sometimes Sonic doesn't even move in the direction you input. Then there's the issue of Cyberspace having different physics entirely, so the skills learned in the world don't apply. It's just a mess.\n\n- This game has a parry move. It's lame. You hold both bumper buttons with no timing needed. It also does this annoying thing where it slows time. How is that annoying? There's a guardian fight later on that you MUST parry to beat, but when you do, you're just stuck waiting for it's next move because you can't attack it while in that phase. Repeat until it finishes it's phase. It's just lame design that feels completely untested.\n\n- You can level up Sonic's stats, but they take WAY too long. Speed and Ring levels can only be increased ONE AT A TIME using LAGGY menus. It will literally take around 30 minutes to max them out just using the UI alone. Who thought this was a good idea?\n\n- The UI in general is just laggy. You need to wait for the game to allow you to select and press a button it presents. There seems to be some arbitrary delay on these actions for some reason.\n\n- There's a big issue that comes up in the story that goes absolutely nowhere and is resolved in the exact same scene it became a problem with no real stakes at play.\n\n- There's a pinball challenge I really hated but I just hate pinball tbh.\n\n- The story cutscenes are just kinda lame. It's all just standing and talking.\n\n- I know for a fact there's more to this list but I can't think of them right now. May edit later.\n\nOverall, a good game with many issues as said at the start. Just keep your expectations in check and you'll probably have a good time. For once, I'm actually more of a glass half-full guy in this scenario. There's a lot wrong with this game, but it gets quite a lot right, and when playing I felt like the good outweighed the bad just enough."", ""As a long time fan, Sonic Frontiers is the most fun I’ve had with a 3D Sonic game since Sonic Generations. This game does have issues, but as a whole, Sonic Frontiers is a really good time and moves the series a few steps in the right direction.\n\nThe story is a large improvement from the last few games. Throughout the last few Sonic games, the characters have felt butchered. Most characters were either made really dumb, annoying, or just plain pitiful. There were a lot of jokes and dialogue which rather than being funny, made my eyes roll or had me cringe. Sonic Frontiers corrects most of these issues and even improves the cast overall. The story tackles elements like the origins of the Chaos Emeralds, Cyberspace, an Ancient Civilization, and brings in references and events from past games within character interactions.\n\nI appreciated the callbacks in the story and the new antagonist Sage is also a fairly well-developed character throughout the story. While I enjoyed story overall, some cutscenes didn’t quite work for me. Also, some cutscenes are stiffly animated and I feel the ending could have been better as it just sort of fizzles out instead of being grand or epic. With that said, the story did keep me engaged throughout and has some exceptional character growth and even some good arcs. Props to the writers for making these characters have actual depth.\n\nSonic Frontiers gameplay is really fun. I believe Sonic hasn’t controlled this well since the Adventure series. I found the moment-to-moment gameplay exploring and platforming across the islands to be really enjoyable throughout the entire game. I enjoyed platforming around finding memory tokens, completing small puzzles, and doing mini-games. There are puzzle types that repeated a little too often and some are just okay, but I appreciated that most of them were quick and never felt like a chore. I never found myself getting bored and there was rarely an instance where there wasn't something to do.\n\nThere are traditional type levels in this game called Cyberspace. I didn’t care for the stages initially. However, when I got used to them, I found them to be really fun, and some of the later ones I enjoyed a lot. I find that Cyberspace levels are at their best when speedrunning them. Performing a Homing Dash by boosting immediately after doing a homing attack can send you flying. I wish there were more than 4 themes in Cyberspace as some of the ones present have been done so much from previous entries. Fishing with Big the Cat is simple, but fun type of simple.\n\nI thought the combat was decent. I did like the various moves you could unlock and it was satisfying chaining combos together. Parrying was a little too easy once I figured out how the mechanic worked. There was some good enemy variety with most being fine, but there are a few annoying ones. I found the mini-bosses and especially the Super Sonic Bosses to be very good. The Super Sonic Bosses are a highlight of the game in general. Unfortunately, the Final Boss was a disappointment to me. It didn’t ruin my experience, and it was definitely unique compared to all prior Final Bosses, but it could have been better.\n\nFor general issues: the pop-in is pretty bad, there is a bit of jank to the controls and bosses, and camera control is taken away a little too often. But despite all the problems I listed and a lack of overall polish, Sonic Frontiers was just really fun while playing it and the good outweighs the bad much more often.\n\nThe music in Sonic Frontiers is AMAZING! This may be my favorite soundtrack in the series. I loved it all, from softer island music to the EDM Cyberspace songs to the head-banging Titan Boss vocal tracks. It was all done extremely well.\n\nGraphically this game is very good. Most of the environments are nice to look at and there are some beautiful sites, however, pop-in does detract from it. The Cyberspace levels also look good despite the theme re-usage.\n\nTo summarize the pros and cons:\n\nPros: story, characters, references, open zone platforming, movement controls, mini-games, cyberspace levels, combat moves, enemy variety, mini-bosses, Super Sonic bosses, fishing, the entire soundtrack, and visuals.\n\nCons: stiff cutscenes, camera issues, jank, visual pop-in, lack of level themes, and a disappointing Final Boss.\n\nThe final score I give Sonic Frontiers is an 8/10. I liked this game a lot. I hope Sonic Team sticks with this formula because they really have something here. Also, keep Ian Flynn on the writing team please, he did a great job with the characters. If this is able to be improved on we might just get the greatest Sonic game yet. The future looks bright and I look forward to what happens next… across these new frontiers."", ""Sonic Frontiers is a definitely a video game and its most certainly a game I have played. Now you get to witness my crappy review of this video game because I’m too obsessed with this dumb blue hedgehog. But if you don’t care to read this entire thing, I’ll just give you the tldr. I really like this game and I think it’s really fun. It’s not perfect but I think it does some nice things and I’m really excited for the future of this series.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics for this game are beautiful. Everything looks so nice and detailed along with the menus and interface looking really clean and simple to use. Do I think it’s the best-looking Sonic game? I don’t know. I still prefer the look of Sonic Unleased more and I feel that game did a better job mixing cartoon and realism while in this game the areas are much more hyper realistic. With this style I feel that Sonic looks somewhat out of place when exploring the islands. The cyberspace stages however, retain that Sonic aesthetic we are used to and they look super cool. Even though they reuse the Green Hill, Sky Sanctuary, and Chemical Plant themes they still look awesome. I do wish that they used more original themes as I am getting sick of the same stage themes being reused over and over again.\n\nSoundtrack:\nIt’s a Sonic game. They never miss with the soundtrack. Undefeatable GOATED. Nuff said.\n\nStory (Spoilers???):\nThe story for this game isn’t anything grounding breaking but for a Sonic game I thought it was good. The stories for Sonic games aren’t masterpieces in storytelling so I wasn’t expecting anything to wow me but I was hoping for something more interesting compared to what we had in previous games. I think this story delivered on that. Learning more about the Chaos Emeralds and the Ancients was really interesting and makes the overall Sonic lore more expansive and engaging. I especially like how Sega is trying to make the series lore more connected and is using this game as a staring point by referencing a lot of past events the characters went through while also trying to expand on it with the new lore and character interactions as well. They even mention characters like which now means they are canon in the mainline series. It does make me wonder if Sega will go even further and get characters from other Sonic shows and series like Sonic X. I think it would be really cool if we had a game based on the Metarex Saga from Sonic X (PLAYABLE DARK SONIC PLEASE!!!!). Who knows but it's pretty exciting to see where the story for future games will go next. The interactions between the characters in this game were also pretty good as well. I especially like the one between Sonic and Tails. I really liked seeing this as it felt like Tails is going to have the chance to become a much better character in future games and I’m honestly excited to see how he develops. I don’t think this game has the best story in the series, but I appreciate the things that it does and I feel like it’s a small step to make the Sonic universe more connected and expansive. Thank the GOAT Ian Flynn for writing this story and I hope he and others that are more knowledgeable about this series can help write and contribute to the stories of future games.\n\nAlright all that other stuff I mentioned don’t even matter. It’s time to talk about how this game actually plays. So what do I think of this game??? I think it’s pretty fun. Starting with the controls, Sonic actually controls pretty well. Sonic moves and turns quickly and smoothly. Sonic also comes with a lot of movement options as well like the homing attack, quick step, dodge, double jump, air boost, and drop dash. With all of these options it’s very easy to get where you wanna go around the world. I also love that you can also easily change the controls in the options if you don’t like them. Sonic too slow? Increase the top speed. Sonic turning way too fast? Lower the turning speed. It’s really awesome that this game gives you the option to perfect the controls to however you like to give the player the best experience (Sega really just said “Oh you think know how Sonic should play? Fine do it yourself ♥♥♥♥♥.”). But all that stuff I mentioned was for the overworld. How does Cyberspace control? It controls fine enough. Compared to something like Generations the overall gameplay for Cyberspace doesn’t feel as good but it’s not all bad either. Sonic still has more movement options in this game than in Generations so you can still have some fun moving around in these stages. I would probably compare the two games like this… In Generations Sonic controls like a racecar. Very fast but harder to control. In Frontiers he controls more like a fast bike. Slower but easier to control and do tricks with. In my opinion the gameplay in Generations feels more exhilarating but the gameplay in Frontiers isn’t a bad alternative either. Now let’s talk about the level design for the Cyberspace stages. So a lot of the levels reuse layouts featured in other games. This is honestly a bit lazy but it’s not a 1:1 translation. Only the STRONGEST of Sonic fans will truly notice but if you are a Sonic causal or newbie then you probably won’t care too much. The level designs they took are the good ones and they play great in this game too. I would still prefer if this game had its own completely original stages but I hope that Sonic Team uses this as an opportunity to learn how to design good stages for the next game. Let’s go back to the overworld and discuss a bit more about that. So in this game we have 5 islands each with a different theme. But really there are only 3 with the last two islands technically being a part of the first island. I don’t really have a problem with the last two islands but seeing the same grass theme again was pretty boring and it feels somewhat misleading to think that this game would have 5 unique islands. The last two islands are pretty much the endgame islands though so they are a bit more challenging in terms of platforming and enemies you have to fight so they are still enjoyable. Just disappointing. Each island has its own challenges and obstacles you can play with to unlock the map and get memory tokens. The challenges aren’t anything special, but some can be fun and they can be completed quickly. This game also features an actual combat system. The combat in this game is really fun. Its very simple but you still can unlock a lot of different moves to beat enemies in flashy ways so you never really get bored with it. I would love to see this combat be expanded upon in a future game. Lastly, I’ll quickly mention the boss fights. The boss fights are honestly the best part of this game are most certainly the best boss fights in the series. Super Sonic is so flashy and cool and you feel extremely powerful when fighting the bosses. It's just so hype.\n\nSonic Frontiers isn’t the best game to exist, but I do like it. I’m glad that Sega and Sonic Team have come up with a game that me and a lot of other fans are enjoying. I think if they take the time to improve on the positives of this game and expand on them while fixing some of the issues, we could have a really nice Sonic game in the future. In conclusion, Genshin Impact bad (For legal reasons this is a joke).""]"

You can tell the mouse controls are mapped to momentary joystick inputs in the engine and it doesn't work *at all*\n\nCombine that with a 60 FPS frame cap, bad pop in, Denuvo DRM, and cutscenes that only play in 30FPS and look garbage. It's not a great recipe.\n\nHOWEVER, I have played a fair number of Sonic games and this one (in my short play time) seems to have actual good gameplay, which is more than I can say for the other games I've played. So I will be refunding the game for now but if there's a patch with FPS unlock and Denuvo is removed, I will probably come back and give this game another chance, because I really do want to like it."", 'Product refunded\n\nCurrently completely unplayable for me. My pc is more than capable of handling this game, but after I spent way too much time fixing the graphics options crashes so I could even get into the game, I spent 3 hours trying -everything- I could in game and on my pc, it just wouldn\'t play above like 5fps. Really poor performance seems to be a common issue for a lot of NVIDIA geforce users.\n\nI can\'t say what I do and don\'t like about the gameplay itself, since I literally can\'t play it, but the UI is clunky (I didn\'t care too much tbh), consistent, repeatable crashes that happen -every- time I navigated through graphics options or whenever I pause the game (the fix I found for the graphics options crashes was from a sonic origins game fix... so they literally haven\'t even fixed previous well known issues), uses Denuvo, so internet will affect the game and performance and the game will one day be unusable unless they remove that, and performance overall is so poor to a point that the game is -literally- unplayable. All things that would be expected or acceptable out of an early access game, not as much with a full release AAA title at full price that had been delayed significantly to -fix- issues and performance. There are a significant amount of pc users with the same exact problems, and I find it hard to believe the devs didn\'t notice the game literally not working. It looks like even the switch version runs better.\n\nTLDR, this game does seem to be the best game they have done in decades with some solid music and story, but for me that doesn\'t mean much since I can\'t even get past the opening tutorial. After all the delays, they still released a dumpster of a game for the pc version. Them releasing it in such a state has been a refreshing reminder to myself to just forget that I used to love sonic. My bar was really low for this game to begin with. I didn\'t think I was expecting a miracle, I just wanted to try the new sonic game, but I guess a ""working"" game was too much to ask for.', 'First Screen, right off the bat, trying to fix sound and screen settings, but typical click on what you want to change or effect... does NOT work, you got to first, from Option menu itself, click on Options first, THEN the next \'category\' before it\'ll show you the actual options, (and right click to cancel to go back \'up\' to previous choice)and even then, you can\'t click on the bar but make it go up/down 1 click at a time. So it DEFINITELY feels like strictly made for controller with mouse support as a side-afterthought. Even the on-screen controls show ""select"" with spacebar and ""ctrl"" for back. if you aren\'t going to have proper mouse support, don\'t put it in at all?\n\nFirst level. Game freezes for 5-10 seconds, no keyboard controls work.\nTrying to get in-game menu to try to get options, Half the time ESC didn\'t work or P wouldn\'t open menus, so had to quit the game to try to lower the settings even further, which was on default low, then lowered resolution few times.\n\nAny game you have to do so much, just say your a controller-based game, and say keyboards not well supported. don\'t make me hit 208 buttons just to reset the level or escape, or even change volume. So bad startup impression I would refund it cause it\'d take more then 2 hour to try to diagnose just exactly what\'s going wrong.|Went to borrow controller, and low-and-behold the game functions so much better, just proves it wasn\'t designed for keyboard/mouse for me. Should be posted on main page.\n\nEdit : Plus after getting out of the first mission, had to reset the controller a few times (fully charged and default Xbox controller) cause the game chose to ignore the left stick\'s input after a load screen (fell off edge, oops). I haven\'t been able to get around first map without issues. then load screen tells me how to change outfits, cool, go to title screen... wait how do i get there again? ... after 5-10 minutes of exploring the menu, found no way to return to main menu.. so Alt-F4 it is.... Menus are NOT this difficult to make quite user-friendly\n\nEditx2: Played for awhile more, using both keyboard/mouse (to test) and controller(to play/enjoy the game). This game is great if your console/controller based. But if PC, I would expect some basic fundamental UI ... well ""basics"" IE: you click on an option, it goes to it, not 3 other options so it will ""unlock"" your sound bar. can\'t just go to it and click. not major, but this applies to EVERYTHING in the game.\n\nYes, there are ""Free"" updates, and they are doing changes slowly, sure. It\'s the AAA price-tag and to put it kinda bluntly, a crap-show-poor PC-port job. As a console, sure put that Price up, but come to the PC world, there\'s basic standards for AAA games, such as FAR more control (without moding/file editing) on your graphic settings.\n\nSome things I don\'t mind options being limited in like graphics, such as framerate, why are they making so few options? idk, but since the human eye for 90% of the population can\'t tell much above 60 fps, anything above that is basically useless for me.\n\nTLDR: Great game, horrible price for POOR pc port by Sega. MUST have controller to really \'enjoy\' and control the game. Get it under $30 and it\'ll be worthwhile buy, but there\'s no ""recommend on sale"" option.']"

It needs work and fixing, but I think that this time that's actually a good thing. Many things are very much not finished: the obvious pop-ins, the weird physics, Cyberspace feeling slow and sticky, the story pacing at times, the world sometimes feels a bit lackluster in versatility, the forced notifications or camera pans towards enemies and so on, but this will all help Sega going forward. They will learn and understand from these mistakes and (hopefully) grow and adapt solutions for these.\n\nLooking beyond the flaws of the game, you can feel that they genuinely tried their best to make something more worthwhile to play: first proper open world Sonic game, more intricate combat system, a story that feels like it's inspired by Unleashed and the Adventure games (thank you, Ian Flynn), characters that no longer feel flat, a kick ass OST that (most of the time) absolutely slaps HARD AF, bosses that hype you up and feel exciting to fight against, exploration that always has your attention, a world that feels like it has emotion and expression with a nice aesthetic and many more of said good details. It feels like we're back in the early 2000's of Sonic. It's not perfect, but we're having a good 'ol time with our buddy Sonic again.\n\nI could not possibly recommend this to someone who is not a Sonic fan. Even more so, I feel like this game is not meant to be played by a larger audience than the Sonic fandom (even if they promote otherwise). It feels more like they are trying to apologize to us, the Sonic community, for their past mistakes. They want to walk away from the disaster that was Forces, and follow this new direction they took with Frontiers, and I think that's a really good thing.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, the Steam store page says 'Overwhelmingly Positive' with about 6000 reviews, and that to me is very beautiful. Since the day the first teaser dropped, everyone was scared that Sega messed up once more. 'Here comes the Sonic cycle again'. But here we are, about a week after release, and even though many of us are still conflicted and confused on what to think about Frontiers, we can all confidently say that Sega, in fact, did not mess up, and that we got a Sonic game we have all been waiting for for a very long time.\n\nIt's far from perfect, it's far from the best Sonic game, but I'm sure we can all agree that beyond it's flaws, it's a damn good Sonic game.\n\nLet's just hope Sega keeps their promise and keeps improving their quality going forward into this new decade of Sonic."", 'no way, sega can make good sonic games?', '♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sega made a good Sonic game']"

It definely has problems and lacks quite a bit of polish, but there are a lot of cool ideas I wanna see Sonic Team iterate in the future and potentially turn this concept into a 9/10. As it is it\'s just ""alright"", but considering how rough Sonic had it with Forces, it\'s more than what I could ask for.\n\n- Basic story that gets extremely rushed by the end and has the most disappointing last boss I\'ve played in a good while. Yes, I did play on hard mode.\n- Great character writing. Sonic\'s back to being an overconfident little guy and it\'s great.\n- Decent gameplay. Open zones are fun (if not a bit repetitive) and cyberspace as a whole has decent level design, though unpolished as this game is it has a little bit of jank to both modes. Please mod Enhanced Dropdash into your game.\n- Decent visuals even if art direction looks weird. Still looks like a tech demo on the overworld, but cyberspace looks great.\n\nI do have some gripes with this game though. The complete lack of momentum (outside of rail jumping), the constant nostalgia bait on cyberspace (and the general lack of new levels as a whole) and I guess how janky it feels as a whole. Like I said, this game is unpolished and it feels like it, although still perfectly playable. I hope I\'m not making this sound like it\'s a Cyberpunk situation, it\'s not.\n\nOverall, it\'s a 7/10 game, and a pretty good Sonic game overall.\n\nI\'d rather not mention mods into reviews like these since I\'d rather have the vanilla game to stand on it\'s own merits, but mods definely changed the experience for the better for me and I\'m gonna do some reccommendations if you\'re feeling like modding your game. Setting up hedgemodmanager is pretty easy and gives you tons of options.\n\n- Enhanced Dropdash: The vanilla Dropdash straight up doesn\'t work sometimes, this mod not only fixes those issues but enhances the move exponentially, all while being extremely customizable. I\'d say, out of this list, this one is the only ""must-have"".\n- Tracker\'s Physics Tweaks: Adds momentum back into the game and was specifically designed to not break the game\'s level design. Works on both the overworld and cyberspace and also includes some pretty neat toggable minor combat tweaks.\n- True Physics: Similar to Tracker\'s, it enhances the game by adding momentum back into it and designing it around the game\'s level design, trying to not break it. It\'s a bit more robust, with velocity-based animations and better slope mechanics, but it only works on the overworld for starters. You can make it work in cyberspace, but it\'ll take a bit more effort (involves merging mods together).\n- Combat DX: Overhauls the game\'s combat to be a bit more intricate without changing too much of it. Has combo ranks and combo trees, but makes enemies a bit too spongey. Would also need merging if using alongside physics mods.\n- No Cutscenes After Challenges: Every time you do a map challenge, the game will stop to show you your reward and what part of the map you unlocked. Since it\'s unskippable, it gets pretty grating after 10 or so hours. This mod skips it, just make sure to set the option to still show the map after you complete a challenge or otherwise it won\'t count towards map completion.\n- Quick Boot: Self explanatory. Just boots you into your desired menu faster, make sure to configure it accordingly and read the instructions.\n- Improved Arcade UI: Better descriptions for stages in the Arcade menu.\n\nThere are also codes in hedgemodmanager that enhances the game without having to download anything. My favorites are:\n\n- Bouncy Ball Jump: Reintroduces the cute little squash n\' stretch jumpball from Forces. Looks great.\n- Disable Running Fall: I personally dislike how Sonic would keep running in the air after falling off a ledge. Some say it\'s to pay homage to the old Genesis games, but I just think it looks odd and unfinished. This makes so Sonic transitions into his falling animation instead.\n- Homing Attack Trick Animations: Reintroduces trick animations after homing attacks by randomizing the in-game trick poses.\n- Fix Grind Leaning: Grind leaning animations look a bit odd, this fixes it.\n- Drop Dash on Double Jump: Makes so you don\'t have to press jump three times to dropdash.\n- Retain Ground Velocity After Jump: HUGE improvement over the old jump. Makes so your ground momentum carries over to jumps.\n- Tighter Jump Rotation: Makes jumps more controllable, though this is a bit of a hit or miss. See if you like it.\n\nThat\'s it. The game\'s good but these made the experience much better.', ""TLDR: Is this game perfect? No. Did I have a lot of fun with it? Yes. Would I recommend it? Yes.\n\nI was one of those people who were leery of the idea of an open-world Sonic game and not impressed by the early glimpses we'd gotten. I am pleasantly surprised by just how good and how much fun I've had with this game, but that does not mean it is perfect or free from criticism.\n\n★ Gameplay __________________\n\nThe gameplay is divided into two major categories - the open world, and the cyberspace stages, which both have a completely different feel.\n\nBy and large, the open world feels pretty good. It feels reminiscent of Unleashed, tho lacking in certain aspects of control like the drift. It also employs a combat system that took some getting used to. The idea of being able to parry in a Sonic game is still extremely foreign to me despite having finished the game.\n\nAs for the cyberspace stage gameplay, it feels more reminiscent of Forces. That is to say, extremely clunky and precision platforming is an absolute nightmare. I basically played the cyberspace levels enough to 100% them and have no intention of returning. Open-world tho? The first two islands feel SO GOOD to just run around and vibe in. This is the first time since Unleashed where I truly feel like I have a sense of what it would feel like to be in Sonic's shoes, blasting around in whatever direction my whims take me. The third island onward things get a bit frustrating with a lot of forced 2D segments that are difficult to break the camera out of. Is it a dealbreaker? Nah, but it is annoying.\n\nAs a final thing to point out, the boss fights at the end of each island are, generally, an absolute spectacle with a couple of exceptions. Also wtf to the hard mode final boss. It's not necessarily BAD but.. VERY VERY not what I expect in a Sonic game.\n\n★ Aesthetic __________________\n\nHit and miss for me. I do think the open world is gorgeous, but nothing about it feels 'Sonic' to me. I'm also not a fan of the bumpers and rails just randomly placed around the realistic looking open world. Don't get me wrong, I generally find them fun from a gameplay standpoint, but there was absolutely no attempt to integrate them into the island's aesthetic so they just look jarring and out of place. Either they should have been more integrated into the chosen aesthetic, or the overall aesthetic should have been made more Sonic-like. Preferably the former. I would love if an update was made that removed all of them so I could just run around the maps freely without looking at them.\n\nFor your more familiar checkerboards and whimsically designed robots if you happen to be missing them, you'll want the Cyberspace levels, but even then you'll just run the same three-four level aesthetics over and over again. It sadly feels very much like they cheaped out on the assets.\n\n★ Story __________________\n\nThis was the major draw for me. Sonic comic book writer Ian Flynn was chosen for the script, someone the fandom has been calling for years to work on the games. Does the story live up to expectations? Overall, hell yes. The character interactions feel genuine. They feel like actual characters with personalities and relationships and not flanderized tropes spouting one-liners.\n\nThe story focused a lot on uncovering the mystery of the Starfall Islands while also working to rescue your friends, along the way dealing with the new character Sage. Sage is a worthy addition to the cast in terms of character (not so much in design, in my personal opinion), and the overall mystery had me intrigued. I livestreamed the whole game over the course of several sessions, and the entire time I found myself speculating in my attempts to figure out what was happening. There are a couple of major aspects (no spoilers) that I wasn't happy about, but overall, I'm very satisfied and hungry for more of this kind of writing.\n\nAlso, can I just say that I'm pretty sure I was the ONLY person who called Sage's story and relationship among the characters prior to the game's release? Can I brag about that? I'm going to brag about that.\n\nAnyway, Sega, more of this. Please. Give us more story and more fleshed out characters like this. These are the characters we deserve.\n\n★ Music __________________\n\nIt's Sonic music, it's usually the one thing you can count on to be amazing no matter the quality of the rest of the game, and this does not disappoint. There's a couple of tracks I was meh at, but overall? Excellent. I have been listening to Breaking Through It All on loop for several days and I am begging you to NOT send help.\n\n★ Overall __________________\n\nOverall, definitely give this a look, especially if you're a long-time Sonic fan or perhaps a former Sonic fan who stepped away from the franchise. It's not perfect, but it's fun. I hope that Sega will revisit and refine the concept of an open world Sonic game in the future. And, I would be 100% okay seeing Green Hill yet again if it was in an open-world style, I'm just saying.\n\nHoping for some good DLC!"", ""Let's start on the negatives, so we can leave on a good note. Every Cyber Space level are copied level design from other Sonic games. Story reason or not, I find this pretty pathetic. If I wanted to play Generations, then I'd play Generations. If I wanted to play Unleashed, then I'd play Unleashed. Hell, if I wanted to play Sonic adventure 2, then I'd play Sonic Adventure 2. This a full price retail game, this is inexcusable. It doesn't help that Sonic is designed for the open world here, and not these very linear platform heavy stages, that mind you weren't designed with his physics in mind, as they are just copied from other Sonic games. it is clunky. Sonic's jump also isn't very good. Sometimes the game will expect finer movement from you with platforming, and the jump is just not good for it at all. It serves its purpose, but it could be better. The open world is sorta just a very big hub world. Despite being open world, it really is not. The game is incredibly linear. Sure while you can technically go wherever you want, the game will constantly force you into directions that you weren't planning on going. Everything is separate from each other, there is absolutely no smooth transition. The story is sorta boring until I wanna say the 2nd island. It sorta just doesn't give you anything to hook on for the first 4 hours. One big thing that was disappointing was that the bosses did nothing but get worse. The first by far was the absolute best and most fun, after that they just get less and less cool, and the final boss I'd say is completely boring. While not inherently a flaw, I think the physics aren't a great fit either. I'd imagine most if not everyone would love to see a game where you control your speed and how fast you're able to go by mastering the terrain, and not by pressing a button to just go fast. This works in games like Unleashed and Generations, because those are most definitely what I'd call quick time event games. The game benefits from knowing when to use it, and how you want to use it. But in Frontiers, I think it's just unnecessary . This does nothing but make it feel like Generations and Unleashed, but worse. Because it doesn't add anything to the game. Also the visuals are boring, it's just the real world but you plop Sonic and some ancient tech into it. But enough of the negative. Firstly, I love this game, and it was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome. Despite everything I've said, the game manages to be fun. While I don't think it's the best gameplay, it certainly had a ton of effort and passion put into it, and I respect it. The game is fun, a lot of fun, and that's all I can really say about it. I don't exactly know why it's as much fun as it is, but it's fun. They did well with what they had. The first boss at the very least was super ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun, and hype as ♥♥♥♥. 2nd was also good, just not as hype. And for the first time since Unleashed, did the story actually feel epic. Besides the boring first few hours, I quickly became invested in it's plot. And the new character Sage is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ adorable and I love her. The music is an absolute banger too. Good lord, this ♥♥♥♥ is awesome. Never has Sonic felt more like an anime since...idk Black Knight? Anyways, the game has flaws, but damn is it a good foundation. I'm certainly happy with what we got. And I'd even say it's worth the full price. And it certainly makes me super excited for it's sequel. If they keep with this formula, I have no doubt the sequel will be a 10/10. But for now, I'd have to give Frontiers a 7/10. But it's certainly worth it. It may have issues, but I promise you will have fun. And that's my long ass review of Sonic Frontiers. Oh, and the references are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome, and a few made me ♥♥♥""]"
10,9,71,9_just_sonic_like_open,"['just', 'sonic', 'like', 'open', 'really', 'game', 'world', 'fun', 'feels', 'combat']","['This is by far the least ""Sonic"" Sonic game ever.\n\n1. Controls: The game simply doesn\'t play well as a PC Port. Inputs can sometimes be eaten and other times the game will queue up a follow-up action if you accidentally click twice in rapid succession. I -STRONGLY- recommend buying this for console if you have one (And even then I would suggest a different game first).\nAlso for some reason there are 3D portions of the sub-levels where Sonic just... doesn\'t go with the flow of the level? The level will go left or right, and Sonic will just... not. He\'ll end up running into a wall. In Sonic Generations things like this didn\'t happen, and are hard to navigate on a keyboard. If this is something fixed with a controller, it should\'ve not gotten oversight for a PC Port.\n\n2. Gameplay: This game tries too hard to be too many other games at once. It has elements of Breath of the Wild, Shadow of the Colossus, Dragonball: Fighter Z, Bleach (Anime), Fishing SIM World: Pro Tour, a random Beyblade reference(?), and 1080 Snowboarding. It definitely has the ""Gotta Go Fast!"" aspect that Sonic is known for. The problem is that in the overworld, you don\'t know WHERE to go fast. The map is only filled in by completing random side-quests that involve (most of the time) NOT going fast. These include hitting balls through hoops by hitting them from different angles, completing Legend of Zelda style tile floor puzzles where too much speed and you\'ll likely mess up and have to restart, and... jumping rope for 20 seconds without messing up... There\'s a Sonic Spinball style puzzle as well but it\'s a generic pinball game that takes too long to complete and in no way feels rewarding.\n\nThe next gameplay issue is the lack of level variance. At the time of making this I\'ve only completed about 25% of the total game (60% of 3 zones out of 5). In those 3 zones, I\'ve ran into at least 4 variations of Green Hill Zone and 3 of Cloud Temple. There are a couple others, however I found it strange that I\'d run into that many of the same levels with as much of the game I had left to explore.\n\nOne EXTREMELY painful part of this game (And devs if you ever read this, I cannot stress this enough) is the forcing of 2D platforming in the 3D overworld. HOLY GODS this is the most annoying thing imaginable. Picture this: You\'re Sonic, going fast. As you\'re Mach 3\'ing all over the overworld you stumble across a random speed pad that you didn\'t notice. Hope you weren\'t planning on going that direction, because NOW you\'re headed the opposite direction in a 2D space and you cannot force your way out of it until completing the section, 600 meters the wrong way from your destination, unless you fall to your death or lose all your rings and die (which both only sometimes work). You can definitely press W or S to try and go 3D, but invisible walls will keep you on the set 2D path until you\'re done with it. Why anyone thought this was a good idea is beyond me.\n\nLet\'s talk about something cool now to break things up! Something unique that Sonic Frontiers brings to the table is the creation of new routes in the overworld after completing the mini games. After completing all of them, you can easily traverse whichever zone you\'re in with relative ease. As an OG Sonic player I thoroughly enjoyed the idea of seeing new paths opening up as I progressed through the game.\n\nOk, enough of that, back to more issues. This game has cutscenes. Most of them skippable! What a time to be alive! One cutscene that ISN\'T skippable is the ""Sonic has gotten his max amount of rings and can now go SUPER FAST with the boost button"" cutscene. While it\'s only 5-7 seconds, the amount of times it happens in the game is excessive. At various points in the game you can choose to upgrade your max rings and I haven\'t thought of a decent reason to other than ""Now I won\'t see this cutscene as often"" and that\'s kinda silly.\n\nSpeaking of upgrades! Sonic now has... stats? You can collect various items from slain enemies (which usually means you\'ve gotta stop going fast to 180 and collect them since they don\'t auto-collect like they should) to upgrade Sonic\'s Attack and Defense Stats! After fighting 3 bosses and various ""elite"" enemies in multiple zones I still have no idea what the defense stat does. It doesn\'t seem to slow the amount of rings you lose when in base Sonic form, and provided the bosses have super easy-to-dodge damage mechanics I\'m unsure of whether ring depletion in Super Sonic form is affected. The attack stat is nice, provided bosses have healthbars now! *Confused Hooray*? No longer is the game \'hit the boss 8 times to defeat it,\' but do more damage by collecting the resources and completing fights in less cycles. Speedrunners are gonna have a hayday with this. You can also increase Sonic\'s speed, which is super nice! If... you get really good at dodging those 2D speed traps that ruin your overworld fun.\n\nFor the record, I\'m not opposed to 2D levels. They were an amazing throwback in Sonic: Generations and they were absolutely lovely to experience again. However Frontiers refused to capitalize on that by instead creating clunky versions of 2D space in their 3D levels. Many sections simply don\'t feel like they fit well with the speed at which you are going in the 3D space when transferred to the 2D portions and vice versa. It\'s almost disorienting the first couple times it happens and then just morphs into an annoyance.\n\nThis next part might just be my age creeping into it, so I\'ll try to be as objective as I can. I\'m 34 years old. I\'ve been playing sonic games since the age of 5 and the whole ""This game is all about FAST"" was very alluring to me. When Sonic got his little *BZZT* of damage by pressing the jump button a second time in Sonic 3/Sonic & Knuckles, I thought THIS IS AWESOME HE CAN DO DAMAGE AND NOT HAVE TO POSITION DIRECTLY ON TOP OF THE ENEMY NEATO! But now... There\'s combos? There\'s Mortal Kombat/Fighter Z style attacks? Sonic shooting energy waves out of his hands like an energy blast attack? Really? Is it cool to see happen? Yeah, I guess. It just feels weird that it\'s SONIC performing these attacks. Sonic had always been the game about fast, be the FAST! ROLLIN\' AROUND AT THE SPEED OF SOUND! But the convoluted amount of extra STUFF packed into the game just makes it feel less like Sonic and more like a clone of other games.', ""Overall Score: 6.5/10 A fun, but incoherent mess that needs more time in the oven. Not worth the 60$ price tag or even the 40$ sale in its current state.\n\nThis was a unique sonic experience from the start to the end. I won't get too much into the story as this is mostly focused on the gameplay itself.\n\n* Movement - Clunky and Unpolished\n(Disclaimer. I played this with a mouse + keyboard so I can't tell how it feels to play with a controller)\nIn some parts of the game your movement will feel buttery smooth and amazing and in other parts it will feel like you're playing a souls-like with your feet while blindfolded, let me explain. Usually when your movement is restricted you can enter a flow-like state in parkour areas where sonic feels amazing to control and it's all around a fun experience, the problems come in when you get the constant switching between 2D and 3D or 3D restricted movement and 3D non-restricted movement. The changes happen suddenly and whenever there's not a clear sign that it's gonna occur it can lead to frustration.\n\nTurning sonic while jumping is close to impossible without dashing and if you jumped a little bit too far and want to turn around to fix it, too bad. There are 2 ways to dash in this game, with Z to follow coins or with Shift for a general dash. In some parts of the game where you feel like you should use Z dashing to follow coins it can often just lead you to parts where you suddenly fall off the edge and if you're just slightly off having the perfect angle you sometimes follow the coins in the wrong direction instead, the pathfinding needs to be worked on. Normal dashing makes you fly very very far. This is good when you wanna get to places far away, but often I found myself in situations where I thought a dash would do the trick, but it ended up being too far and I had to re-do the entire section.\n\n* Combat (Sonic) - Simple, but fun to watch\nThe game basically plays itself, most fights are usually just pressing the same buttons every encounter, but with cool animations to watch. I found myself switching my attacks often, not because I had to, but because I didn't wanna see the same cutscene play out over and over again. I thought the skill tree would be an interesting part of the game, but it got maxed out pretty quickly and there was not really any sense of accomplishment when getting a new attack. They even have an auto combo feature which I turned off in the options as I wanted some sort of action in the game. And last but not least, parrying is way too overpowered. Why do I just need to hold down two buttons to become completely immune basically every attack in the entire game from any direction and I don't even need to time the release or anything. If you're fighting something and don't know what to do, just use parry and it will probably do something favorable most of the time.\n\n* Combat (Bosses) - Chef's kiss\nI did not expect the bosses to be this good. Every overworld has a select few bosses that each have their unique way of taking them down and even though some of them are repeated, most of the time it's just fun. Squid games and Foretress are probably my favorite overworld bosses as they just look pleasing and feel great to take on. The main story bosses are a mixed bag, some parts of them are amazing while other parts just leave you confused as to what is going on.\n\n* Overworld - Aestethically pleasing with eyesores sprinkled everywhere\nThe overworld design as a base is nice and vibrant. It's not amazing, but it's pleasing to look at and fun to run around in. The ruins and otherworldly technology fits like a nice glove and is fun to explore. But then you have the eyesores. Now I know that the rails, springs, floating platforms, ziplines, treadmills and random crates have a purpose of being parkour sections, but that doesn't make them any nicer to look at. It doesn't feel like any of it was meant to be there and if you take a step back it all just looks like a jumbled mess, not to mention that they also have vertical culling applied to them, so sometimes when you're falling down after a parkour section that took you high up in the air, suddenly a rail pops up out of nowhere. Gameplay wise it's nice to use for travelling or just to have some momentarily fun parkour, but design wise it's awful.\n\n\n* Cyber Space Zones - Awful doesn't begin to describe it\nOn paper it sounds like a good idea. Classic sonic level designs where you go through a level as fast as possible and with multiple different routes to pick from, nice!\n\nNo... just no...\n\nOverall these cyber space zones gave me a massive headache, Depth perception issues, restricted to non-restricted movement, Sonic randomly stopping, turning left or right in 3D is close to impossible, dashing off the stage because it's very sensitive, Z dashing into coins don't work after jumping off from rails, some parts that look like they intended for Z dashing are actually not, dashes don't reset when jumping to enemies so often you fall down thinking you had the dash still, locked camera angles, losing all coins when you die even if you respawn at a checkpoint where you had coins before that point on the stage, some stages require close to perfection with the times while others just require you to walk towards the goal at a moderate pace and much much more...\n\n2D Cyber spaces: These are the most tame ones as they restrict your movement and a few of them are well designed and fun to play through. The parts I dislike about these are that sometimes it goes from you just cruising along to a precise platformer when you least expect it.\n\n3D Cyber spaces: Oh boy, the worst part about the game. You fall off the stage constantly, depth perception leads you to miss targets you thought you'd hit with a dash, why aren't linear parts that are clearly split into 3 sections actually split into 3 sections so you can quickly switch between them. The only way to properly control sonic in these 3D stages is to completely ruin all your momentum and make sure you perfectly line yourself up cause if you're just slightly wrong in what angle you're looking at you can fall off the stage so easily. Whenever I found a cyber space portal I prayed to all that was holy that it wasn't a 3D one, they don't work when you're running fast, there's no clear level design and if you want to experience what a 3D cyber space has in terms of potential, go play Neon White. I got frustrated to no ends with these cyber spaces and it left a sour taste every single time to the point where I hated it whenever I found a portal.\n\n\n* In conclusion: If you can stomach the price, poor movement in certain sections and cyber spaces. Go for it, this game is in its core fun to play. If you can't do that, then don't. This game feels like it's lost, it's attempting multiple different things yet masters none. It left me feeling mildly annoyed and I naively thought it would get better, but it just stayed the same throughout the whole thing. But you know what, the game has fishing and the soundtrack has some bangers. So it's not all that bad I suppose!"", 'This game is stupid fun, and the best sonic has felt in years. I really wanted this game to succeed, and i was really glad to get my hands on it when it first released. (I initially got the switch version, but since getting a steam deck i got the game on steam too and have been enjoying higher graphics and framerate). Sonic feels awesome, the characters havent felt this alive in a long time, and the overall direction of this game has me really excited.\n\nNow, this game is not perfect. Far from it. The general consensus is that this game is a 7/10, and for sonic that is a miracle in the modern day. However this is the most ambitious, fun, and high-inducing 7/10 i\'ve played.\n\nThe movemement in the open zone is really awesome, sonic turns very easily and while boosting you move at a fast pace. You can get a great flow going, moving from obstacle to obstacle. You can run past whatever you dont like, and engage in whatever you find fun.\n\nHowever, the pop-in is really noticeable and sometimes ruins the flow of gameplay. There have been times where ive been stopped by an invisible wall from an obstacle that didnt load in yet and it is very frustrating. Additionally, the jump kills any sense of momentum you have. For control, this works great. but for speed, it feels pretty bad.\n\nKronos and Ares island were really fun, i loved the ambient music for both of them and i loved how the game let you freely traverse where you wanted to go. There are many mini obstacle courses throughout the islands and you can choose to go where you want, and if something isnt fun you can just leave it. But just moving around and getting collectibles was really fun. And traversing to any part of these 2 islands were very easy.\n\nThe same, however, cannot be said for Chaos island. Chaos island had a frustrating amount of forced 2d segments that you were sent into from any spring or dash pad. It was hard to see what was ahead because of the forced perspective, each section felt sluggish, and overall i found myself ignoring these obstacle courses because i was not having fun with them. Whats worse, is that in the previous 2 islands there would be these markers that you could cyloop to get a lot of memory tokens. Chaos island has these too, but instead of memory tokens they are just springs or dash pads that send you flying into these 2D sections uncontrollably.\nMeanwhile, the map is segmented between a bunch of islands and it is really hard to find out how to get where you need to go.\n\nNow most people were upset about Rhea not being a full blown island, but i really liked the break from formula on climbing the towers. The epic music and fun platforming while climbing comically tall towers, all while the dread of watching really grabbed back my attention and made me want to keep playing. And after the mess that was Chaos, when i started ouranos island i was just happy to experience the freedom of kronos island again. It was disappointing to see that it had the same aesthetics, but i still found the last island to be enjoyable.\n\nThe combat in this game is definitely new and fresh, but it needs balancing and more incentives. My enjoyment on combat was mixed, sometimes it was very fun and satisfying, sometimes it was a chore. Some of the guardians were really fun to fight! Some of them were just quick time events (looking at you shark) and were far from engaging.\nMost combat moves learned from the skill tree were just different finishers used by different buttons, but were functionally the same. Or you get sonic boom, which is just ""hold down the trigger to win"". But then you get a really cool ability like quick cyloop, or tricks which are completely separate from combat! There is a lot of potential, but ultimately the skill tree just needs more unique abilities and not just finishers that look different.\nThe parry is also incredibly overpowered and abuseable, unlike in other games with parries you can just hold it forever with no sense of timing. You can even cheese the jump rope challenges by holding parry midair, you just float motionless in the air and it does not feel like something that should have made it into the final game.\n\nBut there is one thing that the skill tree really augments: the titans. The first 3 titans were some of the most fun and excited i have been playing sonic in such a long time. The music is awesome and pumps you up, the moves are flashy and cool, and everything is over the top in such a spectacular way. And unlike previous games where super sonic has a completely different moveset, your combat abilities now stay the same and instead are super flashy and deal massive damage. The first time i faced giganto i had goosebumps and was screaming out loud. It was so exciting.\n\nOn replay though, the epicness does kinda dwindle with the knowledge that you can just hold parry and win really easily. There is no downside to using it all the time, there is no timing to it. The wyvern fight was awesome the first time i played it because i had no idea you could parry the missiles, so i had to dodge left and right while constantly moving. Boosting felt like a risk because i could easily get hit. But on a replay i could just hold parry and skip the chase phase entirely once 1 missile gets reflected. Basically: the titan fights are really easy. Once you get over the awesome music and spectacle they really lack any form of challenge, and aren\'t as fun as when you first faced them. Its also criminal that there is currently no way to replay any of the titans unless you have a save file you save right before the fight. Though hopefully DLC will fix this.\n\nCyberspace is a mixed bag, sometimes the levels are really fun and other times they just dont fit sonic\'s movement well. For some baffling reason they decided to make sonic\'s turning while boosting in the 3d levels a lot stiffer in cyberspace, which makes playing as intended a lot less fun than it could be. The 2d stages meanwhile are slow and floaty, overall i didnt like them as much\nHowever, with the unintended mechanic of homing attack cancelled boost, you can go zooming past the stages and it is actually a lot of fun. plus, its easy to pull off, all you need to do is press homing attack then hold the boost before you hit anything. Trying to break the intended path to get a very low time has been the most fun i\'ve had with these stages. 1-2 especially, with the absurdly tight S rank time it was realy fun to optimize it. Its a shame no other level has such a tight time like 1-2 did.\n\nThe music? absolute god tier. every part of the soundtrack is genius, and ive been listening to the different songs all throughout the game on spotify ever since it released. Every cyberspace level has unique music with different styles, theres a freaking lofi track for fishing, the beautiful melancholic music of the open zone, or the adrenaline pumping metal that plays during the titan fights. There is something for everyone here, and as someone with very wide music tastes i appreciate all of it. (except for that one song that plays during that ONE sage cutscene in chaos island, the singing is off key and it sounds like nails on a chalk board to me. i hate it)\nAnd the music that plays in the credits? The lyrics had me tearing up.\n\nso overall? Sonic frontiers is a mix of a lot of things, many of which are fun but could be better. And yet it gives you so much freedom to do what you want, that you can just skip the parts you dislike. Everything about this game makes me really excited for the future of sonic as well as the DLC. Plus, hearing Kishimoto on twitter actively listen to feedback and talk about him wanting to fix problems with the game has me incredibly hopeful. The highs of this game are incredibly high, and while there are certainly an amount of lows in this game, you either forgive and forget, or you can just ignore them entirely and never have to encounter them. 7/10.']"

One of the greatest and most attractive characters ever thought up. He can run at sound speed, take out enemies in a flash, and best of all, he\'s blue colored and knows how to handle the females. Speaking of females, the Sonic universe might also be classified as ""Hot Chick Heaven"" because there\'s such a mess of very beautiful and tough women that it will make you love the franchise even more! And since Valentine\'s Day is around the corner, I\'ve been inspired to make a top 10 list of the most beautiful female Sonic characters. Grab yourself a snack and a glass of orange juice, and try not to reach through the screen because HERE WE GO!\n\n10: Try this question on for size. Who chases and hugs Sonic all the time and wields a powerful hammer? Why it\'s Amy Rose of course! Though more of a cutie than a hottie, you can\'t deny the fact that she\'s still attractive. Two things that make her attractive are the fact that she wears a dress, and when have you ever seen 3 big, very smooth arcs of hair sticking out of a person\'s forehead? I haven\'t! So once again, Amy Rose is lovely; that is until she goes berserk and starts hitting stuff with her hammer.\n\nWho\'s at number 9? It\'s this alien plant girl from a distant planet. Cosmo, from Sonic X. She arrived on the character\'s planet to deliver a message saying that the galaxy was under attack by a force called the Metarex. She doesn\'t do much except tell people to stop fighting and focus on the real matter at hand. The real reason she lands at the #9 is that she becomes Miles ""Tails"" Prower\'s sweetheart, something Tails needed for a long while.\n\nNumero Ocho. Cream the Rabbit\'s mother, Vanilla. She\'s attractive and the size of an average human mother. What really surprises me about her is that the leader of Team Chaotix, Vector the Crocodile, falls in love with her. Kinda silly, don\'t you think? She\'s another character that doesn\'t do much, but in a season 3 episode of Sonic X, she helps Chris Thorndyke get into space to fight the Metarex along with Sonic and friends.\n\nWhat number\'s next? Seven, of course. Wave the Swallow from Sonic Riders. People always root for the good guys, but sometimes, the bad guys steal the show. Her mechanical IQ is equal to Tails. She also happens to be the smartest member of the Babylon Rogues. I wonder why she isn\'t the leader. Like Jet the Hawk and Storm the Albatross, her specialty is riding the air-boards called ""Extreme Gear"". With two very long and smooth feathers extending from her head to her calves and droopy eyes, Wave will rock your socks. If only we could see her take wing.\n\nNumero Six. Tikal the Echidna from Sonic Adventure 1. Named after an ancient Mayan city of the same name, Tikal is the daughter of Chief Pachacamac. She\'s yet another character that hardly does a thing except beg her father to stop being so greedy. She also traps herself inside the Master Emerald so that the water god Chaos doesn\'t reign terror upon the land. When you\'re the daughter of a person in the highest power, you need to look your best and Tikal delivers perfectly. That\'s why she\'s #6\n\nNumber #1, #2, #3, #4, #5! Ah-Ah-Ahhh! Mina Mongoose from the Sonic Archie comics. How could you go wrong with a girl that looks like this? She can run nearly as fast as Sonic and she went from being a Freedom Fighter to being a popstar singer. Next to Princess Sally she looks more humanoid than the other characters. Who could top someone who has long mauv hair?\n\nThis female standing at number 4: Blaze the Cat. One word: Pyrokinesis. How would you like to have that superpower? I mean Blaze could play around in the Himalayas for hours and she would be perfectly fine! Also, 45 degree ponytail makes her look like a Native American. I really like the fact that her love interest is the telekinetic hedgehog Silver. The combination of mind-moving and fire superpowers make these two a reliable couple. But what really lands Blaze in the #4 spot is that her attitudes apparently more different from the other females.\n\nNext up is #3. What\'s better than having a female with cascading quills? How about a female with cascading quills and hair? Julie-Su the Echidna, another Archie comic exclusive has that feature. She\'s smart, knows exactly what to do as a freedom fighter, and even trained Amy once. She\'s also the girl of Knuckles\' dreams. Heh, lucky him. Her older self in the series Mobius: X Years Later is just downright hot! Just look at that long ponytail! Now we\'re talkin\'!\n\n1, 2, button my shoe! Princess Sally Acorn. There\'s a lot to say about this character. She\'s the heir to the throne, Sonic\'s first official romance, the only character that used to not wear clothes, brave and athletic, the most humanoid character, and is like a mother to Tails. In the TV show, Sonic SatAM, one Freedom Fighter, the cowardly Antoine constantly tries to woo Sally, but doesn\'t succeed because... he\'s a coward! The Princess is also a semi-perfect example of an excellent love interest, although there were a couple of times when she really snapped and acted like a lunatic; in the comics, that is. But overall, Sally Acorn really stands out amongst the slew of females not just because she\'s Sonic\'s first official love interest, or because she\'s the only one who didn\'t wear clothes, but because in the comics, she grew very long hair, and married Sonic in the future, becoming the Queen.\n\nSo, you\'ve seen a pyrokinetic Cat, a swallow, two gorgeous echidnas, and even a princess! Who could possibly top those kinds of females? Well, get ready folks; this is the #1 hottest Sonic the Hedgehog female character. Rouge the Bat. If anybody denies it, how dare you? This woman can fly, she\'s as strong as Knuckles, and is a femme fatale, seducing other characters into getting what she wants. Instead of having one love interest, she has two! Knuckles, and Shadow the Hedgehog. Being a treasure thief, she\'s only interested in one object set; jewels, especially the Chaos Emeralds. There actually have been situations where Rouge\'s cleavage has been exposed, but it eventually got censored. What a price to pay. I think the best part about this beauty is that she wears three different outfits unlike the other female characters. And who wouldn\'t want to fly across the landscape via strong as Shawn Johnson, and flirt with any male, anytime, anywhere. These three traits make Rouge the Bat triumph over all of the Sonic the Hedgehog females. My hat goes off to you Sonic Team USA. You oughta be proud.\n\nThere ya have it folks. Those were the hottest female chicks in the Sonic universe. I hope you enjoyed it, happy Valentine\'s Day\n\n\n-Guptil89', 'I\'VE COME TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

I would not recommend this game at full price.\n\nWarning: Minor Spoilers ahead\n\nCONS:\n- Cyber stages are poor attempts to reuse level design from past games, most from SA2.\n- Only 4 aesthetic themes for all the cyber stages despite the above point\n- 3rd island is janky to play since most of the platforming challenges forces you into the 2D perspective\n- 4th island is nothing like the others and consists of ONLY a few tower challenges that can all be finished in ~30min. Also uses the other half of the 1st island as a base instead of being a new island.\n- Final Titan not nearly as fun to play as the others. Spectacle is nowhere near as good either.\n- The last boss\n- Pop-in is really REALLY bad, with obstacles and assets loading in even AFTER you get to them. Playing on a 3070 with a 5600X. The game is poorly optimized.\n- open zone obstacle assets are all generic and don't relate to the island's theme\n- 60 FPS lock, while there's ways to remove the FPS cap, it ends up breaking the game at several points.\n- parry isn't a parry, but is instead a block you can hold that auto-counters (which trivializes fights)\n\nPROS:\n- First 3 titan fights, albeit play janky, are super cool spectacles with amazing music. Probably the most memorable super sonic segments there've been.\n- The fundamental concept of running around as sonic in an open area is just plain fun, especially in the first two islands."", ""i have got all the achievements on ps5 and on pc, this game is a huge stepup from the last decade of games, the last good 3d sonic game before this was gens or debatable lost world for me, theres so much that i love about this game but there quite abit of negatives like cyberspace, i like cyberspace i find it fun af to speedrun the stages using the homing dash but this doesn't make it ok for the rehash of level themes, level design and the bad control, the game starts to go down in quality in chaos island by the constant use of 2d which gets rlly annoying when you play it, spoiler warning from here onwards, riea island (idk how to spell it sorry) is a beautiful island but turns into my least fav island due to it being only a story event which is disappointing because the island would of been my fav if it was a normal island, the final island is just a bigger kronos with inflation so i like to call it inflation island (reminds me of england rn) it takes alot of collecting to get the island finished unless you do what i like to do fishing, fishing is actually kinda fun this game its just a quick qte's and easy rewards, the ending of this game yet again is disappointing, supreme being a giganto clone and being a boring fight left a sour taste in my mouth, and the final boss the end was so anti climatic, sonic not reacting to sages death did not feel like smth sonic would do i think he would of cared and checked on eggman but unfortunately we didnt get to see that, after all this ranting it makes it seem i hate the game when its quite the opposite i love this game alot i have played it 7 times now 6 times on ps5 and once so far playing the game modded, the best part of this game is definitely the first 3 titan bosses, they all have amazing songs to go with them and the fights themselves are 10/10s, the ost is rlly good too thats all i have to say on the ost go listen to it,\ni rlly reccomend this game despite the game clearly needing more time to cook the foundations here can make the next sonic game even better, buy it on a sale\n8/10"", ""This game is freaking awesome.\n\nI don't know if I would have ever paid or if I would ever recommend it at full price- but I picked this up for ~$25 USD. This game has its shortcomings which I will mention soon, but overall I would highly recommend playing this.\n\nIt's like if Breath of the Wild was fun. Tears of the Kingdom I got about 70 hours out of but never finished since it was too boring. This game constantly, after about 14 hours in as of writing this, KEEPS THROWING NEW MECHANICS AT ME!!!\n\nSome of the bad I mentioned is almost perfectly summarized in the third island you visit called Chaos Island. The biggest problem is traversal, it's confusing, the map is slow and inconsistent, fast travel via menus is annoying to obtain (needs to be grinded in fishing, and some may HATE this minigame. I absolutely love it). The traversal is made its worst here for the map not showing how to actually get anywhere, but the worst part is this map is filled with 2d sections that lock your camera and movement into 2d whenever you enter them. The issue is when going at high speeds you WILL run into these by accident, and some you simply can not escape until you've gone through ALL of it. This admittedly frustrated me quite badly while playing.\n\nDifficulty within the 2d stages in the game (yes, there are also full on 2d stages!) varies wildly. Some of these are so easy that I get an S rank while dying in the stage or wasting time. 1-2 on the very first world is actually a bit challenging and requires some decent time saving thoughts. I was hoping this trend would continue, and it kind of did? It seems random. You can argue that this is due to the open world nature of the game, but each world could easily get progressively difficult in these 2d stages in my opinion. Especially since they do get harder in one amazing way:\n\nLearned mechanics and application of said mechanics.\n\nThis is game design 101, and while you may say this is the bare minimum for a game to pass, we're talking about a Sonic game. Let's be honest, base game design can be a hard ask sometimes from the Sonic Team (this is mostly in jest, I promise).\n\nall seriousness, you are taught mechanics like dodging very early, and dashing across rings by pressing a button. Neither of these moves are entirely mandatory but can help make you go faster. So you aren't heavily punished for NOT using them, but you're instead extremely motivated to try to use them in order to optimize your game play (quick sidenote, it's not a lame Dark Souls level parry, you literally just hold a button lol, barely any timing needed). Feeling myself get better at using these mechanics in the first stage felt really cool, because I wasn't forced to use these... I was offered them and I got better because I practiced with them.\n\nTraveling across rings was used a lot early on to make things faster, while not being NEEDED. But... guess what? World 2 comes along and BAM, there's a couple sections that show you early on that there is a huge path of rings through a great locked camera position. This is a required area to use this ability, you must use it to progress in a handful of locations in World 2. Now, keep in mind each of these positions are shown VERY early in your pathing through a smart camera lock. But none are sudden. World 3, BAM. There are sudden ones that require quick thinking to progress.\n\nI can go even further explaining this. Even the most core mechanic of dashing to an enemy or object goes from very easy and simple, while doing so effectively can allow for very fast optimizations, meanwhile later on in World 2 and 3 there are plenty of required quick presses of that button.\n\nQuick gushing about bosses. Fighting the first boss without the 7 emeralds then fighting it later with the emeralds feels awesome. Each boss feels progressively cooler. None of them are difficult, but that's... in my opinion okay. You are super sonic in these fights, and because of that... you feel powerful.\n\nThere aren't enough animations for super sonic, and for some reason the game doesn't support above 60fps nor does it support ultrawide monitors. One other annoying thing is on AMD graphics the water is super buggy in fishing. Nothing game play wise is hurt by this, thankfully. These are minor gripes though for me, just mentioning them in case you feel these are deal breakers. Oh, and the story sorta sucks. The characters rock though, and it's entertaining and honestly more compelling than both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom despite my bias leaning towards Zelda 100% in gaming.\n\nI am again, ONLY 14 hours in and absolutely have an incredible perception of this game. For reference, I despise open world games and especially souls like games. This game is extremely friendly for beginners.\n\nLet's finish with the best part of every Sega title: The freaking music!\n\nThis OST feels like the game itself, a slightly grown up version of Sonic! Replacing the butt rock with easy-core, which for reference is essentially the butt rock equivalent of post-hardcore music. The tracks here rule. Collecting extra tracks in game is icing on this cake. I wish there were more, personally. Maybe instead make them unlockable via fishing? That would give me TONS of incentive to grind fishing. Sega, use that OST! Everyone knows Sega games are well known for their amazing soundtracks.\n\nEDIT: Finished the title days later. I keep all my words from above. What an incredible game!! I am doing the after story content right now and the exclusive music for Amy is also lovely.\n\nThanks for reading if you did. I will leave an update above this when I finish the game.""]"

Not perfect, but by far the best foot forward the series has had in years. Controls are mostly solid, my only real complaint I've run into being the Camera being a bit troublesome in main boss fights, the story is solidly the best part of the game thus far, and the character interaction is great as well.\n\nThe open world aspect of it is interested and while a couple of the enemies are more annoying than challenging but the field bosses are quite something. The Cyberspace Levels play out well for the most part, but boosting can be a bit hard to control at some points. The times required for S-rank can be rather challenging on some levels.\n\nOverall, I'd say this is a solid 8/10, and would greatly suggest it to fans of the series, and it's probably the best starting point for new folks to the series in a long, long time"", ""sick open-zone. easy to understand combat and skill tree system, and a visually breathtaking game.\nGood diversity in enemies, incorporating skills that you NEED to unlock to defeat them.\nGreat boss battle Music, Great open-zone OST.\nUnlocking new parts of the map is refreshing, and fun. Think Assassins creed towers but 10x more diverse with a little challenge thrown in there (a very, very little challenge)\n\nCyberspace levels are stiff, and lack fluidity. Cyberspace levels lack diversity, and are nearly all done within a minute. (WTF)\nHorribly stiff cutscenes, and a really odd momentum system thats cut and dry.\nCollectibles are boring to collect.\nCyberspace levels are way too easy.\n\nIf the momentum was a bit quicker, cut-scenes are polished, and cyberspace levels were flat-out revamped to be more fluid, fast-paced and longer, this game probably could've been better than the adventure series. IMO"", ""Without a doubt the best game since generations. The open world gameplay is hands down some of the best the series has ever had but the cyberspace levels feel a little shallow compared to even some of the bonus stages in games like generations or unleashed but some of the later ones do start picking up the slack quite a bit. But since the open world is where you're at most of the time those aren't a huge concern. The story was also probably one of the most well rounded in the series being paced pretty well and even with some complaints about the ending being a bit of a fizzle I thought that it concluded nicely even if there was a bit of a quick wrap up. Overall I'd say it's just barely behind the best of modern and adventure era for me but if you want a fun game that has a lot to give this is definitely one to try out. 8.5/10\n\nThat was what I thought of the game prior to the story expansion update. The new update basically fixed any issues I had with the game before, platforming is way more complex and skill based, the final story has been way more fleshed out an interesting than it was previously, and they've managed to create a sort of blend of Unleashed/Generations and the first Adventure game but have taken mostly just the best parts of both gameplay loops and combined them really well. I still have to finish the end of the expansion so it might not maintain this level till the end but with a majority of it done I have to say this is what should have been here at launch to get a 10/10 for me in terms of a Sonic game. Especially if you do some modding to it to iron out a few of the issues here and there with a physics mod like Trackers Physics it might be some of the best content the series has had. Wait to go Sonic Team for absolutely blowing it away just for a free story expansion.""]"

Thank you Dunkey for showing how ""Good"" this game really is.\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nI have to wonder if I\'m witnessing Mass Stockholm Syndrome with the reaction to this Sonic Game. How badly has Sega hurt Sonic fans that THIS is considered a step in the right direction?!\n\nI\'m genuinely flabbergasted that people are as accepting of this and that the justifications I\'ve heard that it\'s ""Good for a Sonic game"" is how people are swallowing this horse sized pill. Big Ooof.\n\nI\'ve only completed the first Island thus far but I have to say, everything about this feels wrong. I swear, there doesn\'t seem to be any actual DESIGN when it comes to the world building, the pop in for the floating rails and platforms that don\'t exist until you are already committed to the movement is a travesty. This game clearly did not start as a Sonic game during initial development and feels like it was pitched as something else and Sonic was bolted onto it. This is further evidenced by how the cyber zones seem to be using the old sonic control styles as if ripped from those respective games.\n\nAnd the Story, oh man, the story is one hot piece of mess that gives nothing to you as the player for thus far the first 5 hours. (Not that I truly expect a good story from a Sonic Game besides, HEY LOOK, IT\'S TAILS AND AMY, MEMBER THEM?!? WE GOT GREEN HILL ZONE!) The mini-games and little ""puzzles"", if you can call them that, are just cheap button prompt style mindmelters.\n\nThis is a hot mess and I plan on finishing it, if only to see if it ""gets better"". But I have to say I don\'t recommend this, if only to show a little dissension in this ""But it\'s a GOOD game"" mentality\n\n\nHere\'s the update now that I\'m on Island 3:\n\nI get it, you get something that is way more passable then Forces and you wanna praise it and give it all your monies. That\'s your right. But lambasting about it being GOOD and letting all the things slide that make it NOT GOOD, is just laughable. How many times did you get forced to watch sonic get blue lightning before you wanted to rip your hair out? Or the cutting grass minigame to get a Chaos emerald to watch Sonic.....Dance? (The first time I saw this cutscene was enjoyable even if I hated the minigame, but then they kept using it, pretty much like all the reused cutscenes.) Seriously, I gotta be crazy if I\'m the only one pointing out this ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThis game does so many different things instead of focusing on a more core gameplay that the bad outweighs the good at this point. Are you telling me that the boss fights are FUN? Did the J-Rockesque music drop and you just couldn\'t help but be hyped and miss that actual gameplay of the fights,ya know, that you just have to hold the two shoulder buttons and then press the Button prompts on the screen after you auto parried?\n\nMy gripe with the characters being used as plot devices wasn\'t clear before but atleast they aren\'t as grating as they have been in the past Sonic games. I still find their involvement simply a nostalgia nod to past sonic. (Hey! Dat\'s Sonic and Knuckles da game in that dialogue!)\n\nDid you like going to Chemical Plant zone during the cyber space missions 6 separate times? All ripped from previous Sonic games? Did you like that the ""stats"" you were getting in one section of the game were literally removed for the other segments of the game?\n\nThere is NO cohesion to this game, just a lot of little ""gameplay"" things to tie into one big game.\n\nSonic Generations WAS a love letter to Sonic Fans....this is just them trying to be 5 other games at once, doing none of those games well enough to stand on it\'s own.', ""Sonic is finally back.\n\nAfter Sonic Mid world and the disaster that was Forces and launch colors ultimate, we finally have a good 3D Sonic game since Generations.\nFrom the boss fights to the open world its so good, but unfortunately its not perfect.\n\nMAJOR SPOILER WARNING!.\n\nCons.\n\nThe game is way too easy even on the hardest difficulty, you don't even have to time the parry you can just hold the button down.\n\nSpending 30 minutes grinding memory tokens just to watch a 30-45 second cutscene to back to grinding more memory tokens on Kronos island.\n\nThe story minigames are bad with some being worse then others especially the Laser pointing one, the bridge one, and the Ares Island Koco roundup.\n\nThere should've been more variety with the island designs, 3/5 Islands are grassy and that could've been fixed with Ouranos Island being snow themed.\n\nThe pop in is bad and needs to be fixed.\n\nDue to Denuvo the game can sometimes hog up all of the CPU making the game freeze.\n\nGiganto Bug that drops your frames to 30 if you die.\n\nI didnt like how it cuts to a 30 FPS cutscene of Sonic throwing Wyvern against a cliff without a button prompt, while cool I still think it should've been in game without ruining the immersion by cutting to black.\n\n\nSupreme,\nHe was obviously shoehorned in with him literally being a reskin of Giganto, and the fight was almost the exact same too, any new moves the boss had were just boring too.\n\nThe Final boss for hard mode,\n\nHey you know that voice that stops you from going out of bounds and progressing too early? No? too bad.\n\nNext to no story importance, which is stupid because its supposed to be some sort of god.\n\nAnd the fight itself?. Its literally just the space invaders minigame.\n\nNow I know they were rushed and had to cut corners but really?, you couldn't have done any better?.\n\nWhew now that that's out of the way lets get to the good stuff.\n\nPros.\nThe open world is so fun to explore especially when you have full rings with infinite boost.\n\nThe combat is so fun while a little buggy at times with some moves not wanting to register (looking at you wild rush), The over all combat works well.\n\nGiganto.\nWhere do I begin, you first meet him and he demolishes you,\nthen once you have the 6 chaos emeralds you climb up him Shadow of the Colossus style and get the 7th chaos emerald and you have this incredible boss fight, with amazing music, and the overall feeling of being really powerful.\n\nThis sets a standard for Super Sonic one which will hopefully will be the case in future sonic games.\n\nKnight.\nClimbing up him Shadow of the Colossus style again was great. Riding on the shield back to him was really cool. The Boss theme is the best in the game. The 2nd phase with reflecting the shield back at him was awesome. And the end with Sonic parrying the sword and then picking it up and cutting him in half was something straight out of Metal Gear Rising and that's amazing.\n\nThe challenges to open up the map are fun.\n\nCyberspace.\nWhile a little disappointing that there's only 4 level themes, trying to get S rank and complete all of the challenges was really fun, especially 1-2. The only thing I wish was changed is more then 4 level themes, the levels being a little bit longer, and better controls for the cyberspace levels.\n\nFishing.\nIt was very interesting to bring Big the cat back who hasn't been a main character in the series since Sonic Heroes in 2003. The whole fishing minigame was also a huge reference to Sonic Adventure with the theme for catching the fish being a remix of the one from Sonic Adventure.\nIts also the best way to level up your stats with fish giving anywhere from 8 tokens to 75 depending on the size, with a tire giving you 48 tokens for some reason.\n\nClimbing up the towers was really cool and a nice change of pace from grinding memory tokens.\n\nThe sound track for this game is Amazing.\n\nThe length is perfect.\nThe game is 3x longer then sonic forces for just main plus extra,\nand that's not including the upcoming DLC and the fact that they were rushed near the end of development.\n\nAnd finally the mod support. The mod support for the game is incredible, with people already making mods before the game even came out.\n\nI'm finally glad everyone realized that the awful gameplay provided to us by Ign was an early beta build of the game and not the full game.\n\nI still remember everyone complaining about how it looked like a Unity game and how it was gonna be terrible, and how me and my friends all knew it was beta footage and that the game was gonna be good. I'm glad the game turned out how it is, while not perfect it still is in my top 5 favorite sonic games, and my 10th favorite game of all time. 8.5/10"", 'I\'ll be completely honest\nThe game\'s lovely, it feels great to run around the islands, the enemies and specially the bosses are a sight to behold and they\'re (mostly) fun to fight, but this game is undeniably rough around the edges.\nYou can tell the Sonic team was experimenting a lot with frontiers when it came to combat, open-world, etc etc.\nThe combat is good but it definitely needs more refinement\nAs it stands, it\'s just a flashy set of moves that are annoying to actually combo.\nAlso, most of the moves either end up becoming dumb OP through stats leveling up or they\'re too useless to deal damage hard and fast, which is a necessity in a lot of situations, specially when it comes to those mini-bosses that only give you a fairly small window to attack them.\nWhen it comes to progression, think of it as a fast-paced Collect-a-thon, pretty much\nThe formula is ""Go to island>Run around the map and collect character tokens>Talk to a character (and maybe do a small and short minigame)>repeat the last two points 5 times>Go through cyberspace levels (which is hell in itself) to unlock emerald keys>Find and acquire the chaos emeralds for the super sonic transformation>actually fight the boss.\nBut here\'s the thing, the map won\'t unlock itself, you actively need to complete the extreme amount of minigames spread around the island to unlock PORTIONS of the map.\nLong story short, 90% of the stuff you do in the islands are minigames and going through small obstacles courses and gauntlets to get the tokens.\nAND that\'s not counting the whole thing of collecting Koroks or Seeds of Power/Shield, which are a MUST-HAVE for late game because of stat leveling up.\nWhat else...\nThe story is pretty good actually!\nIt\'s not great, it can be a bit confusing but you can tell that a major aspect of Frontier\'s development was having a good story and making sure the characters include themselves in it properly.\nThey could have done a lot more with some characters like Sage though, but everybody was included well and properly in the story.\nAlso, the game has a darker tone to it towards the ending, if you\'re a fan of that.\nNow, more specifically about bosses and enemies...\nWhen it comes to just enemies, a lot of them are gimmicky or have some moves that can be annoying to fight against, but they aren\'t bad adversaries at all, for the most part.\nSome of them actually demand you to use the skills you learned as the only way to counter them and others don\'t open much chances for you to strike so you need to do what Sonic does best and hit them hard and fast for less trouble.\nSome of them are glorified minigames that give you access to the part that damages the boss if hit.\n\nNow, the bosses?\nYeah hmm they\'re amazing, I got nothing bad to say.\nNothing at all.\nThe OST is marvelous, fighting them feels great and they\'re a major highlight of the game, but I\'d be lying if I said that they too aren\'t hit by Sonic\'s problem of stat leveling up making some moves VERY OP.\n\nNow, the world itself...\nIt\'s funky\nIt\'s definitely NOT an empty world, it\'s jam-packed with enemy encounters, the aforementioned gauntlets and obstacles courses and each island feels unique due to their environemnt, world storytelling in the form of crashed Eggman ships, destroyed homes, hell, even the characters themselves constantly comment on the world theorizing what happened to it.\nOverall, the world feels great to run around and explore and since you\'re, well, fast as ♥♥♥♥, it isn\'t hard to go from point A to B in a matter of seconds, maybe a minute at most.\nBut like I said before, most of what you\'ll be doing are the gauntlets, map-unlocking minigames and the occasional mini-boss because you NEED to defeat them to get access to a lot of the cyberspace levels.\nThe island have the size, just not that much variety when it comes to what you can do.\nBut it isn\'t bad, it\'s still a pretty fun experience to just explore.\n\nAnd, as a finishing line\nFrontiers makes it CLEAR that every adventure before Frontiers happened (except 06) through countless references and character dialogues.\nSome people say it\'s ""forced"" but I disagree.\nSure, you can say that they exaggerated a bit on the references, that\'s a fair point.\nBut they weren\'t annoyingly present either, they were normally brought up in relevant contexts.\nIt feels more like ""Hey X, you know what this reminds me of? That one time this happened or that guy appeared, cool uh?""\nIt\'s a single line of dialogue at best.\nIt definitely isn\'t ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ YOU GUYS REMEMBER THIS RIGHT? IT EXISTED! ARE YOU FANS HAPPY THAT WE BROUGHT IT UP AND MENTIONED AND PRAISED IT FOR A FULL MINUTE?""\nIt just feels naturally and not forced.\nbut like, if you aren\'t a Sonic fan, you won\'t understand ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but I believe that these references also spice up the curiosity of a Non-Sonic Fan to try out the previous installments of Sonic\'s history and the calm and natural way they do it definitely doesn\'t strike a bad chord with me.\nFrontiers seeks to tie in every past Sonic game to Frontiers and letting everyone know that as much as every other game felt separate from each other, they were still part of the same timeline of events.\nSo, if you had your doubts about Sonic Colors and Sonic Unleashed taking place in the same timeline or universe, there you go, Frontiers proves they do indeed take place in the same timeline and universe.\nThe references also feel a lot like to ""All of our adventures built up to this game""\n\nNow...\nShould you buy it for full 60 bucks?\nIdk, you do you, but 60 bucks is too much for a game that feels a lot like an experiment or a proof of concept for a new sonic formula.\nI mean, I personally LOVE how Sonic Team is trying to branch out and add more and more to Sonic\'s gameplay, but don\'t go into this expecting a refined experience.\nTry to get it on sale\nAlso, if I were you, I\'d seek to mod a lot of things I\'ve mentioned in this review, like some combat aspects and the physics themselves, the base vanilla game has a lot of flaws that some mods were able to either completely eliminate or make more tolerable.']"

To start off, for some reason the game defaults to settings that limit your momentum so attempting certain maneuvers slow you down too much or just halt you completely. You can select preset setting to emphasize either Action Style or High Speed, I chose high speed but noticed that if I hit a boost pad and let go of my stick I almost immediate come to a halt. There is also a setting that was switched on that slows you down when you jump, so attempting to jump with any type of boost slows you down so you would miss a jump and land in a canyon or a stream of lava. Another thing I notice is that the drop dash has an issue on 2D stages. It works fine on a flat surface but if there's any incline you will lose all of your momentum or stop completely. It replaces the spin dash (which is unlockable) but I assume it would have the same issue of losing momentum on anything but a flat plain.\n\nA couple of the enemies were fun to fight but overall most were boring at best and tedious at worst. Some of the mini bosses that were tedious to handle were the Tank, the Fortress, and the Squid. The Tank would have you watch a cutscene every time it would bring you into the air and the floating attacks that you would have to do felt like trash to land, some of my attacks would put me through the Fortress and I would fall to the floor and have to redo the entire fight, and reaching the Squid took forever even with voltage speed. Sometimes after you're done attacking some of them during their vulnerable state, you would be left so far behind that it would take an entire minute or two just to catch back up to the point where they would start attacking you again. The main bosses also fall into the boring or tedious categories. The Giganto and The End have to be the most boring boss fights in the entire game. Giganto pretty much has you spamming your attack button while The End forces you into a bullet hell in which you can't do any damage for about 2 minutes before the sequence ends. During some of the boss fights I even ran into glitches that would force me to restart the whole fight such as necessary platforms not spawning in or sonic jumping backwards on rails.\n\nAll of the levels that are unique to Frontiers are horrible but the stages that were blatantly ripped from previous games were pretty fun such as level 2-6 which is a reskin of Sky Rail from Sonic Adventure 2 and 1-2 which is literally just Sky Sanctuary from Sonic Generations. The unique levels had no other ways to play them and were extremely straight forward which made them boring and forgettable. There was no thought put into the maps and no exploration needed to get an S rank or to collect the Red Rings. The overworld islands were also all boring past Ares Island. Whoever designed the process of unveiling the map really needs to be fired. You will do a small challenge and the map will be exposed in small, random blotches rather than a radius around the challenge point. The towers on Rhea island had me scratching myself due to their height and awful platforming.\n\nA small issue I have is that this version of sonic is really boring. I don't expect him to be all quips all the time, but there are many moments where Sonic and a lot of the other characters will just stay silent or smile at one another and it's just awkward dead air. Sonic also barely says anything during gameplay, sometimes he'll chuckle or stop by some ruins and comment on it but overall he just feel like a playable character here to move the story along rather than a fun character to be around like he's supposed to be.\n\nThe final thing I'll talk about is the fact that you can literally use Big The Cat to cheese your way through all of your upgrades. I went to a fishing spot for about 30 minutes and spent all of my tokens on Koco Children or upgrade seeds and got my speed/coin capacity to max level and my defense/attack to around level 60 or 70. I'm glad I didn't do all the grinding for speed levels because level 99 speed is just voltage speed. So reaching max rings just gets you to level 99 speed anyways. I also purchased most of the memory tokens from Big since I couldn't be bothered to play the game any more than I had to in order to complete the story. Another thing about the fishing is that it's on a set pattern rather than random pulls. Through my 30 minutes of fishing I went through the cycle about 2 or 3 times and noticed that all of the catches would repeat in the same order.\n\nTL;DR the game has momentum issues, boring or tedious enemies, easy access to max out all upgrades, many glitches that will have you restart boss fights, and sonic feels off.\n\n\n\ni came back to this review multiple times to edit in things i forgot about"", 'I really had an expectation to at least go out of this game thinking it was a good turning point for sonic, the game peaks 3 hours in and does the exact same thing it did in those 3 hours in a worse way for the next 15.\n\nBoost - Boost is still an over-centralizing mechanic and the game is worse for it as much as its been said. Boost attempts to fill in the gaps of bad level design by restoring your momentum constantly but not allowing you to really feel like youre a master of the momentum system in the game, because you dont need to be, to some people this isnt a big issue but a fast paced action platformer that barely rewards your momentum is awful game design, not because boost doesnt have any positives, but because the positives of boost can be obtained with better level design. Boost is a crutch the Sonic Team has leaned on for way too long and it is definitely the case here once again. Also, the springs not resetting your air boosts feels incredibly bad in some of the levels. So many of the bosses and mini bosses are designed so that you just hold boost at them for like 30 seconds - 3 minutes, no reward for good gameplay execution when the game expects you to already be going the maximum speed 24/7. This being said I don\'t even believe that boost is the worst part of this game, but a large contributing factor.\n\nOpen World - The open world felt hollow, the activities to do in the open world were easy and not very engaging at all, felt mostly like a time sink with no real depth to it. The game that comes to my mind the most in terms of such a throwaway open world design is Dragon Age: Inquisition, where so much of it is just meaningless gameplay fluff, but the awful part about this is that most of the game is this gameplay fluff, about 95% of it actually. The most unique thing Sonic: Frontiers open world did was add the Sonic The Hedgehog platforming to it, and its execution is neutered by boost and too heavily designed around it, also the inclusion of 2D sections is maddening because sometimes if you run into a boost mat(? dont remember what theyre called) or a spring it can force you into a 2d section where you are quite literally locked into it and forced to either complete this sequence (anywhere from 5 seconds to 1 minute) or break out of it by failing it to some capacity (going under a platform, missing a spring, etc). It is also worth saying that the 2D assets cannot be often targeted when in 3D as if they dont exist. Fishing with Big The Cat is a nice break but also feels like it is just sorta there to fill in the gaps for the flaws in the open world (good luck hitting 99 all stats just by being rewarded from the open world) that being said i did like the idea of it being an alternative to doing the open world content when i was getting tired of it.\n\nMovement - I\'d say the movement in this game feels okay at best and extremely awful in a lot of moments, some levels feel like they punish you randomly for not knowing whats going to happen off screen for doing the things the game has been teaching you to do the entire time, randomly punishing the habbits the game has taught you with some masochistic stage design. The best i got this game to feel was when i mastered spin dashing up a slope and getting Sonic to be in the trick state which is like the only way to keep momentum for a good while in the game. Lots of animation locking which feels like it removes a lot of fun execution that could be there. The second stage (1-2) taught me so much to get that S Rank just for the rest of the stages in the game to let me get S ranks with 10-45 seconds to spare on my first attempts. The tech that stage taught me mostly just helped me not get owned as much by the jank down the line and i was thankful for that (not a jank hater Sonic Adventure 2 is my favorite, mastering jank can be fun).\n\nStory - Definitely cheeks and feels like an afterthought on how theyd work in the open world design into a story which is just, restoring all ur friends by doing all the tasks in the open world and gathering memory tokens. The little rock fellas are super cute though shouts out to them they kept me going. Voice acting and dialogue was pretty whatever as well.\n\nBoss Fights - The first Super Sonic fight was a lot of fun to me and got me very hooked! I thought to myself ""if this is just the beginning im excited to see whats next"" unfortunately the fights following were just not that great, and because I decided i loooooove fishing with Big The Cat after the first area was cleared, I was one shotting most everything and while i could say that maybe you shouldn\'t level your power up so fast early, i feel like i would have preferred if the game stopped me cause... why wouldnt i see how far i can push the game early on for fun? Even though i was insanely overpowered early that didnt stop me from having to wait 1-3 minutes on very easy fights because they relied on making me hold boost for 3 minutes to be able to attack, some of them are okay and definitely cool to look at but didn\'t do anything for me gameplay wise.\n\nStages: - Stages in this game are mostly just references to old games with about 4 different themes, some of them were okay and kinda just let you get through them, some others really just arbitrarily punished habbits the game taught you for the sake of difficulty or whatever, in general there wasnt a single stage that felt like an ""iconic"" Sonic stage to me, very lazily put together and didnt reward you very much for any sort of mastery, didnt go back to any of them after getting the 4/4 completion. I hope we get more unique stages and new things instead of what feels like referencing old sonic material over and over and over. I could die happy never seeing the Green Hill Zone map theme again in my life.\n\nCombat - Starts off sorta fun, very quickly you\'re given abilities that are priority use over everything else save for a few situations, its very obvious. This wouldn\'t be that big of a deal and you could still have some free form fun if almost every fight in the game and smaller enemies included were Mechanic > Vulnerability Phase, basically not doing the easy optimal cyclone dashes or whatever they\'re called just means that you may be fighting some mini bosses for 5-8 minutes instead of 1-3, which after you do it the first time you definitely will not want to take it slow. The Immune Mechanic > Vulnerability phase gets tiring really easily, the parrying mechanic requires nothing out of you and the reward is very good often, you don\'t even have to time the parry you just have to hold it until you get hit as you can sit in the parry state infinitely. All the fights in the game degrade in quality as the stats and broken cutscene moves become more relevant.\n\nClosing Words - This game feels like it entirely just takes inspiration from other games better than it, and tries to execute what they have but fails in almost every single way. The positive response to this game has been very shocking to me but i was sold until after about the first 3-4 hours, after which the game took a massive dive in quality and its cracks started to show immediately and only get bigger and bigger. I was just passionate about a new Sonic game and getting to have it be the first game to break in my new PC! Hoping it would turn the series around for the better, and i think because of the reception of this game we are probably doomed to having generic open world sonic games for the next few years at least, i hope not.. but that will probably be the case. I was debating writing a review on this but I feel very strongly in the opposite direction of many people and want to make sure that maybe others who feel the way I do have a review to take a peak at that validates the idea that the love for this game may just be a giant psy-op. :3\n\nAlso sorry for the bad grammar but if you can digest this game you can digest this review x', 'Actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful, but it has a fishing mini-game so I am obligated to say it is good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR it\'s bad. Awful even, but the Sonic fanbase is in a Stockholm Syndrome love with it since it\'s… I was going to say a not terrible Sonic game but it\'s still pretty mediocre even by Sonic standards.\n\nThe movement is terrible. Sonic, even with his max ring boost, feels sluggish. He also stops on a dime the moment the controller goes into neutral even while boosting, which one could argue is for the new focus on platforming. This falls apart when you realize that the stomp has performed that function just fine in past games and would have done so here as well. Most of the time it feels like he is physically attached to the ground, god forbid you accidentally go off any ledge that isn\'t a 90 degree angle or you\'ll be boosting into a kill zone. Running on an open field? Don\'t worry you are sure to just trip over a random rock and get sent flying in a random direction, usually backwards. Or hit a boost pad or spring that will send you into a on-rails section that it locks you into and proceeds to send you off in some random direction. You might think to jump to avoid these things and retain your speed, but you lose almost all momentum while in the air even while boosting. The only time the movement feels slightly wieldy is the on-rails sections where the game plays itself for you with your only input being boost, switch rails, or homing attack. Even then I found myself transfering rails while boosting to only occasionally sent flying backwards. The homing attacks lock on is flighty as well, you would think changing it to only lock on to what is on the screen would make it easier, but it still struggles when there are two or more options to hit. For some reason they made it so your boost, double jump, and most bafflingly stomp are only refreshed on the ground or certain objects, so if you double jump before homing attack an enemy hope you didn\'t plan to do that again. Air boost into a spring? Well, I hope you don\'t need to do that again. Want to use the Stomp for some precision landings in the line of vertical launch rings? Get ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nNext is the combat. It is slow and overly showy. I want to blast through basic enemies at sonic speeds, not homing attack them once and go through a whole combo while using unwieldy special attacks. When I see a big ass overworld boss that I have to run up the side of to hit their weak point I want to homing attack it once, get knocked off and run up again for the other two. Not go through a whole song and dance routine for all 3 of them. I can accept it during the boss battles, but half of those boil down to waiting to use the parry, then mashing once they hit you. Oh yeah, parrying is brain dead too, it isn\'t timing based like you\'d think. Just hold it down and you are basically invincible for an attack before you get slow-mo and either rush in for the kill or hold it down if the game decides that\'s not how you beat this specific enemy so you better not get any ideas. My favorite move is the homing shot, which uses boost and homing attack so better hope you don\'t need to use the homing attack after boosting or you\'ll find that 9 times out of 10 you\'ll be left sitting in the air over a pit while your homing attack target dies and you no longer have a target to homing attack to.\n\nThe overworld and levels themselves are garbage as well. We all heard the joke ""SEGA actually hired the Nintendo-Hire-This-Man"" but it exists for a reason. Everything in the overworld looks like a basic unity asset flip with Sonic looking completely out of place. The only place this isn\'t the case is the levels but 3 of the 4 level archetypes are just a Generations asset flip, with the sole exception being the vaguely generic looking city levels. In lore it was described that the reason the levels were like that was because they were going through Sonic\'s memories, but I guess, like SEGA, Sonic can only remember Green Hill, Chemical Plant, and Sky Sanctuary. While only vaguely remembering what I think is supposed to be City Escape? Speaking of these levels it\'s not only the assets that are flipped but the level design as well. If you\'ve played past Sonic games you\'ll probably recognize various layouts from Adventure 2, Unleashed, and most prominently Generations. They have a different coat of paint but they are still recognizable in a 15-year old making a Sonic OC from a template sort of way. Unfortunately the levels they don\'t outright lift from other games tend to be absolutely no fun at all.\n\nI guess everything else is just the smaller nitpicking stuff that slowly built up to crush my enjoyment. I hated the upgrade system, at least half of it. The defense and offense fruits weren\'t that bad, but the Korok- I mean Kocos that blend in with the gray rocky terrain and buildings are a pain to find. It is even more painful to turn the Kocos in for your speed and ring upgrades. For the fruits all you need to do is go to the guy, turn in all the fruits at once, and get all your levels all at once. The Kocos? You have to individually level up one at a time in a menu that delays itself by a second before it will let you interact with it. It took me 30+ minutes of nothing but this menu to get to max speed and the best part I still felt slow after getting all the Kocos I needed from fishing. Menuing in this game overall is terrible especially for ♥♥♥♥ you want to just do fast, like resetting levels or fast traveling. Oh hey, you unlocked and completed that level and you think that would give you a fast travel spot? What are you stupid? Complete all the poorly aped challenges/puzzles to get the whole map view and then we\'ll unlock all the level statues as quick travel whether you ever touched them or not. Oh you\'re clicking on the fast travel point to go there? Sorry you need to switch to the fast travel tab you idiot. I mentioned it earlier, but the puzzles all feel like poorly aped versions of Breath of the Wild puzzles copy-pasted across the map. My favorite puzzles were the night time only puzzles, where you might think ""oh maybe it will have to be night to do a puzzle related to the moon and the stars, maybe a puzzle that has to do with light and darkness"" if you were playing a good game. No, it\'s the same glowing spots that only appear at night because SEGA wants to waste your time. ""Oh, so I\'ll just use the pass time function that all competent games with day-night cycles have to get it done now"" you might say, but no. There is no quick time passing, so if you are left with only one ""puzzle"" left you just have to sit there for about 10 minutes afk waiting for night to fall. Special shout out to my two favorite enemies, the one that takes control of the camera to fly away leaving a balloon trail for you to go up and kill it when I just want to pass by, and the group of robot wolfs that if you get too close to will circle in a trap that you can\'t jump out of as they one by one come out for you to slowly counter before you can leave.\n\nThe good things?\n-The fishing minigame is simple but fun and it also gives you pretty much all the collectibles. You could ignore basically everything besides purple coins and the star shower event that gives you more purple coins to do more fishing and just unlock everything with Big.\n-The interactions between Sonic and his Friends are pretty nice, a lot of nice character interactions and development that I\'m sure will be disregarded immediately as soon as a new game comes out.\n-Shadow the Hedgehog (the game) was made canon by a Eggman log you get from fishing.']"

La exploración es muy divertida, el control de Sonic es perfecto, las zonas del cyberspace están muy buenas sin abrumar tanto ya que son muy cortas. Ademas, la historia y personajes están muy bien desarrollados hasta donde voy.\n\nAlgo me dice que este juego va a ser perfecto para mods en el futuro, me imagino como los fans meterán mapas nuevos y de juegos anteriores y funcionaran increíblemente bien, ojala así sea.\n\nEn México por alguna razón este juego cuesta solo 750 pesos (35 usd) por ese precio no dudes en comprarlo, especialmente si eres fan de la serie.', 'Cuidado ao comprar esse jogo se você é fan de sonic!\nEsse jogo é só mais um bait, a SEGA e Sonic Team já perderam a mão pra fazer jogos a muito tempo. Sonic morreu galera, vamos aceitar.\n- Jogo com cenários genéricos e reaproveitados de Sonic Generations, os estágios de cyber space se repetem o tempo todo (acho que tem no máximo 4 variações).\n- O jogo é muito repetitivo e as coisas acontecem sem razão nenhuma com 0 de logica.\n- Os puzzles são forçados e chatos.\n- Navegar pela ilha é um saco e você for rápido demais sonic vira um míssil se joga pra fora do mapa o tempo todo e você não tem controle nenhum.\n- Os ângulos de câmera cagados me mataram mais do que os inimigos do jogo.\n- Meteram um Pìnball obrigatório genérico com um score alto pra caramba (e o sonic nem é a bolinha!) chato e totalmente RNG (isso me fez quitar do jogo namoral).', 'O primeiro jogo que entrega o que eu queria de Sonic... desde Adventure 2, provavelmente. Finalmente largaram aquela babaquice infantil do Generations pra cá e fizeram o personagem ser *cool as ♥♥♥♥* de novo -- melhor pra todos, a criançada vai ter a reação de ""mãe, o Sonic é muito legal!"" de novo, e os jogadores mais velhos... também dirão ""mãe, o Sonic é muito legal""! Em suma, o tom do jogo volta a ser o dos Adventures, que é o que eu queria desde sempre. Eu me importo muito com *tom* em videogames, então pra mim isso foi o principal destaque de Frontiers.\n\nClaro que eu também tenho que falar do roteiro -- o estranhamento, até pela pegada mais séria, é natural -- mas depois que eu me acostumei, tudo fluiu super bem. Na minha opinião, é o jogo de Sonic mais bem escrito até hoje, tanto em coesão narrativa quanto nas falas em si. Entendo alguns preferirem o enredo de SA2, por exemplo, mas a execução aqui é simplesmente superior.\n\nMas antes que a lei do Carmack venha me pegar, vamos ao que interessa: o gameplay. A primeira ilha é, para mim, a melhor coisa que joguei de Sonic desde Generations. Daí é ladeira a baixo: o core loop se desgasta relativamente rápido, acho que até mais pela forma na qual a decidir jogar (focando em abrir o mapa primeiro e fazer as coisas depois), mas até que segura surpreendentemente bem a experiência até seu fim. O que piora com força mesmo é o level design: a segunda ilha é pior que a primeira, e a terceira é bem pior que a segunda. O boss da terceira também é bem jankyzinho, então nem isso salva. Pelo menos o boss da segunda ilha é um dos melhores da franquia.\n\nContudo, pra mim o jogo da um bom ""pick-up"" perto do final: me diverti com a breve quarta ilha, e gostei bastante da quinta, mesmo com . Mas aí o final... hum. Narrativamente? Amei. Roteiro? Top. Estética? Arriscada, mas gostei, achei conceito. Gameplay...? Não tinha uma ideiazinha melhor não? Eu não cheguei a odiar, mas o final cria um contexto tão legal que eu simplesmente esperava ficar menos apático a ele. Uma pena.\n\nOs gráficos são “bonitos o suficiente”, assim como o character design novo que achei… ok! O que me incomodou foram as cutscenes: pré-renderizadas, de qualidade batatosa, e lockadas a 30FPS. Ridículo.\n\nA trilha sonora é *gif do cara tocando piano pegando pogo*. Simplesmente maravilhosa. Meu Deus, como senti saudades de uma boss fight aonde eu não sabia se me concentrava do gameplay ou se ficava batendo cabeça, bom demais. E a trilha é ótima em todo o seu ecletismo: a metalera é boa, o acompanhamento sinfônico temático das ilhas é bom, as músicas eletrônicas do Cyberspace são boas, e as músicas mais “tristes” definem muito bem a emoção das cenas onde são postas. Sound Team de parabéns, como de costume. Absurdo ela não estar no TGA.\n\nEm suma, muitas coisas podiam ser melhores, mas Sonic Frontiers é realmente um jogo muito bom, e recupera o que, para mim, é a melhor abordagem do personagem (SA, SA2), há muito adormecida. Espero que continuem nessa linha -- não de gameplay (sinceramente, pra mim, já deu por aqui, não tenho muito interesse em ver eles reiterando esse fórmula), mas de tom. A Sega **tem** que observar a ótima ressonância que o tom do jogo teve com os fãs e até com o público ""externo"" e mantê-lo. Isso é essencial, ou eles vão alienar todo mundo de novo, e talvez aí seja definitivamente.\n\nAgora é torcer pro Iizuka parar de baitar e meter um SA3 logo.\n\nÉ isto. Se você é fã da franquia, considero Frontiers um título essencial, até por essa importância de recuperação de tom. Se você não é fã, mas se interessou por algo do game, certamente será uma experiência divertida, mas espere a Sega parar de cobrar o preço de um Patek Philippe no jogo.']"

If you find it on sale, you may then read this review.\n\nThe game underdelivers at everything new it advertises, and has a few small annoying things inbetween. It's not a worthless experience though, especially if you like digging for the fun in 3D platformers. Let me elaborate.\n\nOpen Zones\nThe open zones were clearly not built with sonic's movement in mind but were instead polluted with mind numbing, automated set pieces, homing attack chains, and annoying activities undeserving of being regarded as “puzzles”. That’s not to say the open zones are devoid of any fun, though, as the game is weirdly true to the series’ roots in the way that once you have a good grasp on sonic’s—thoroughly customizable—physics you will find many creative ways in which to blast through these floating platforms and make the process of collecting items much more fun. That is if you can remember where those floating platforms are before they pop in a few meters ahead of you. This game has serious pop-in issues. This is not a polished experience whatsoever. I use the HedgeModManager to deal with a lot of gameplay and presentation issues. It's incredibly easy to install. Here’s a list of the mods and codes I use that change subtle things that go a long, long way to improve the game. Like seriously. Do yourself the favor of playing with these over vanilla.\n\nMods:\nTracker’s Physics\nIsland Tweaker\nReimagined Platforms\n\nCodes\nDisable Decelerate Collision\nReduced Homing Delay\nHoming Attack Trick Animations\nDisable Running Fall\nDisable Jellyfish Camera Lock-On\nAlways Start with Max Rings for Bosses\n\nThe combat encounters are as flashy as they are mindless and repetitive. There is simply not a system here. You just play a selection of cutscenes that deal damage. It sucks. The bosses are cool and filled with spectacle and kickass music but they’re super(haha) shallow in gameplay and were clearly not meant to be replayed multiple times despite what the post-game content would have you believe.\n\nOne of the stronger parts of the game is, ironically, its traditional stages, most of which lazily steal level designs from previous games, but do offer a relatively new and engaging experience thanks to the difference in sonic's controls. With that said, these controls are weirdly limited in comparison to their open zone counterparts, especially in the 2D stages. This is an issue that was mostly addressed with an update that let players customize sonic’s jump deceleration along with a few other properties that affect both open zone and cyberspace gameplay (The Tracker's Tweaks mod pretty much fixes cyberspace gameplay in its entirety)\n\nThe free Final Horizon DLC shows that the team behind the game did pay attention to fan feedback, and delivered a set of cyberspace levels that show a significant improvement in level design, offering much more open, experimental and—most impressively—platforming focused stages that allow for broader creative movement. Just don’t use the spindash to fly over all of it.\nOh Also They Added Three Whole Ass Playable Characters For The Final Island They Are Fun I Guess.\n\nI like the story on paper, and the ideas and setting it presents, but the dialogue is just not good. At least it’s trying something, unlike the past decade of games, but this is not how sonic stories should be written. Holy ♥♥♥♥ does it feel like a fanfic with the way these characters talk to each other. Ian Flynn needs to dial down on the “telling” of his stories and start focusing on the “showing”. This is infinitely more apparent now that he wrote for a game instead of a comic.\n\n\n\n\n\nTLDR: The game is mostly mindless, janky and has severe presentation issues, but offers a fair amount of depth for those who want to make the best out of sonic’s movement. Don’t look at my playtime I just like messing with mods a lot. The game is roughly 20 hours long. I shouldn’t have said that. Goodbye.""]"
79,78,15,78_cyberspace_island_boost_character,"['cyberspace', 'island', 'boost', 'character', 'stages', 'speed', 'fun', 'fights', 'boss', 'game']","['Easy recommend, for multiple reasons. It has faults though. Also I don\'t exactly shy from spoilers here but I don\'t just reveal the whole plot either.\n\nLet\'s start with the faults. The game isn\'t exactly that clear on what you\'re supposed to do early on, which consequentially makes the first island my least favorite. There\'s a ton you can do almost immediately and there\'s very little insight on what actually progresses you aside from the very obvious things you need to do.\n\nCyberspace is bad. Control wise at least. These are the ""regular"" Sonic stages for the game and they follow the boost formula we\'ve had since 2008. This is definitely the worst boost Sonic has felt ever though, and that\'s including Forces. Everything else about Cyberspace is good though, music is superb, graphics are on point, level design is mostly rehashing past design, but it\'s rehashing design that hasn\'t been rehashed before so I\'m kind of okay with it. The requirements to S rank are also not too bad either, save for the very first 2.\n\nThe ""open zone"" is where this game shines and clearly where all the effort went. The islands are pretty big, and there are 5 of them, but they also kind of feel bland. There are multiple biomes but the first biome gets reused for the final two islands so it feels like there\'s less to explore overall. Exploring is fun though, you really feel like Sonic or the Flash running around at such high speeds. Cyloop is also cool as a way to interact with the world and I do hope it returns.\n\nThis game is tied with Generations for me as my favorite though, and that is for two primary reasons. The story and the bosses. So, starting with the bosses, they are all Super Sonic fights. This seems like it would be repetitive, but honestly I lived for these fights after experiencing that first one. I could not put the game down because I wanted to play the next boss and I wanted the story to progress. These are the most hype Super Sonic fights in this franchise\'s entire history. They have moved the bar for Super Sonic fights so much higher that I fear they won\'t reach it again. The music, the speed of the action, the cinematics, the finishers. It\'s all beautiful. Plus for me seeing Super Sonic actually talk to people right after is fun, since he normally doesn\'t.\n\nFinally, the story. I\'m gonna try not to spoil things, but it\'s definitely written by a fan of the series, specifically a fan that wants the overall lore to move forward. Ian Flynn, the writer for the comics, wrote the dialogue for this game and it makes every character so much more likable than any previous game. This is my favorite story in the franchise. It also seems like they took Sonic twitter saying ""everything is canon"" literally, but it feels cohesive. They reference past games and shows a lot, which I thought wouldn\'t feel right given how wildly the world in this franchise has changed just between each game, but it feels natural. I can believe this Sonic is the same Sonic that took down Dark Gaia or Chaos or the Deadly Six. It actually makes me angry about the writing for Generations. If we had this team writing for Generations, I feel like the lore of the series would be in an extremely different spot today.\n\nEither way, this game puts Sonic in a great spot and I hope Sega doesn\'t mess it up. I do think $60 is slightly too high for it. Maybe wait for a sale or price drop, but I wouldn\'t feel bad buying it at like $50. Like I said at the beginning, easy recommend.\n\nEdit: With mods this game is amazing. Recommend the ""Showin\'s Momentum Tweaks"" mod to make the open world more fun to traverse.\n\nEdit 2: With the 3 major content updates this becomes an entirely different beast. This is peak Sonic the Hedgehog, and officially my favorite Sonic game of all time.', ""Gameplay\nI have played through the first island (though not 100% yet) and so far I've had a blast all the way through. This is probably the best handling for any 3D sonic game so far. It has managed to combine the precise control of the adventure era games with the amazing sense of speed and power of the boost era games. The controls are further helped by allowing you to adjust speed and turning speed, and you can independently vary this for normal and boost running. I turned everything to max as I like twitchy gameplay and am very accustomed to SA1 and SA2 which demand a greater level of control from the player, but if that's proving difficult for you, turning down these settings can make the platforming easier. Its a great design decision that really broadens the scope for player satisfaction, and being able to do it on the fly means you can adjust to circumstances if needed as well (Turn down speed and increase turning speed if you need to do some precise platforming, or just turn everything to 11 if you want to have run around).\nThe open world areas are brilliantly designed, rewarding exploration, full of side quests to do and with plenty of collectables. A particular highlight for me was collecting the Kocos. If you stand still for a while, all the ones in your inventory will pop up and face sonic. As you run around them they will turn to face you. The Kocos are super cute, giving me stone Chao vibes, and being able to see how many you have collected is just fun. I had a blast just seeing how many I could get on screen at once.\nI am pleased to say that Cyberspace levels are fun as well, playing more like traditional boost era games. Sonic does feel like he is up against more resistance as he runs in these stages, but it doesn't make sonic slow, rather it makes you work for that speed (whereas in previous iterations the boost just got you to max speed immediately, its a bit more limited here. I don't prefer either (Boost era were a lot of fun for giving you super power all the way), but this works really well in this game. It should be made clear that the cyberspace levels aren't the main bulk of the gameplay like you may expect in Adventure or unleashed, with the open world areas just being hubs. They are more like bonus levels and only last a few minutes each. They are fun, feel different to the main game, and comprise maybe 10% - 15% of gameplay.\nThe combat is also great. It adds just enough complexity to Sonics tried and tested homing attack formula, while not overcomplicating and still staying true to the feel of Sonic games from Adventure onwards. The big highlight though is the amazing boss battles. They are huge and invite you to scope them from afar to find the right approach to fighting them, whilst also affording the option to retreat if the battle isn't going well.10/10\n\nPresentation\nThe game looks gorgeous. The landscapes are vast and beautifully drawn, colours are vibrant, you can see miles in the distance, reflective surfaces everywhere and everything runs smoothly. I'm playing on max settings at 4k (recoding with the AMD software at 1080p), and still seem to be getting a solid framerate. There is some detail pop in that is quite visible, but thats more or less required on a game this size and speed. It would have been nice to have a few more customisation options, even if my GPU couldn't handle it. Nevertheless, since my HW is quite old now, running at good FPS at max settings and res shows this is very well optimised. The soundtrack and sound effects are very nice as well. In combat, the sound of hitting the enemies gives a real feeling of force and adds to the enjoyment. Standard Sonic fare is here as well, with ring sounds, NPCs make cute noises in theme with the world, destroying boxes makes satisfying crashing noises, you can hear the crass rustle under sonics feet as he runs through it. Everything combines to make the world feel alive. The music is more sparse in the open zones, but what you get is wonderfully composed and helps immerse you in the experience. Sonics more rocky 3D era songs are still present as well, but only come in during cyberspace levels or boss fights, which helps in building spectacle for the player and, for me personally, improves my enjoyment.\n\nStory\nThe story seems to be striking a balance, with a overall serious tone, but not devoid of cartoony elements to lighten the mood. I haven't progressed far enough to reach any conclusions, but what has been presented so far has been of a high standard. It is yet to be seen if this can beat the story in Unleashed.\n\nOverall: A great game, I still have to finish it, but its certainly looking like one of the best Sonic games ever released. Strongly recommended."", ""TLDR\nThis is a sonic game with a lot of jank but is quite good being able to run around an open world without having the stamina of an obese chronic smoker and the variety of control options is quite good the combat is very simple and easy to learn the story is quite enjoyable cyberspace stages are not the best there is a nice enemy variety the bosses are AMAZING\nbig the cat BIG THE CAT IS REALLLLL!!!!!\n\nThe open world\nThe open zone game play is really fun to run around at the speed of sound in at top speed. there is a small enemy variety unique each island the only complaints I have about it are the 2D sections and the umbrella enemies on the second island that the camera locks on to even when you are just running past them.\n\nThe 2D sections of the open world are very annoying especially the 3rd island I would just be running to my destination the be dragged into a 2D section and the only way out most of the time is finish the section of jump over the boosters at the start\n\nCyberspace stages are in my opinion the weakest part of the game all the stages were from previous games with reused assets from generations or forces with only 3 visual designs (Green Hill, Chemical Plant, and a new city style area) and since all the stages were from previous games sonic does not control well in these stages with the new game play style. The 2D cyberspace stages do not control very well at all since there is no momentum to running or boosting the second you let go of the direction you are running you just stop instantly.\n\nCombat in this game is very simple not much depth to the skill tree either it mostly comes down to mashing the attack button and occasionally holding down another button but some enemies require you to do the sonic new featured move The Cyloop. the cyloop is a nice addition besides using it on enemies you can also use it to collect rings and even get unlimited boost for a short amount of time.\nThe enemies here are nice since its not just boost to kill but some are still used as homing attack fodder to get to certain platforms but overall there's not much to say.\nMinibosss can range from really fun to just straight up avoiding it every time its on screen\nBosses also known as Titans are extremely good in this game with each being very unique in it own way being way over the top with their presentation and designs with amazing vocal tracks to boot reminded me a little of Metal Gear Rising Revengance. The final boss of this game can only be fought on hard difficulty I highly enjoyed fighting it but some people wont since it is a very different style of game play compared to the rest of the game\n\nBig the Cat is back and is ready to fish. The fishing in the purple portals is just relaxing with that lofi music and a nice break from the main game. with bigs fishing you can buy stuff for upgrading stats or if you dont like some of the minibosses or cyberspace stages you can buy the portal gears and vault keys from big with enough coins from fishing. The main highlight here are the Egg memos you can purchase from big each one containing Eggmans story and character development in this game.\n\nThe story of this game is very simple Sonic Tails and Amy were flying around in the tornado then suddenly get dragged into cyberspace sonic escapes finds himself on the star fall islands finds Amy and runs into Sage a few times while trying to uncover the secrets to the island and collecting the chaos emeralds fight the titan of that islands rinse and repeat for the rest of the islands except the 4th island which is a more of a transitional story island. There is a lot off callbacks to previous games that any sonic can can enjoy Knuckles is back to being is normal self with his rivalry with sonic and not just the cliche dumb strong character Tails also has his character redeemed from what happened in forces Amy got some nice development Eggman and the new character Sage also have really good character development.""]"
80,79,15,79_sonic_games_gameplay_came,"['sonic', 'games', 'gameplay', 'came', 'like', 'movies', 'make', 'game', 'world', 'motor']","['Of course being a sonic fan almost kind of requires being overly critical of every game that isn\'t from at the very latest: 2010. That may be partially because of nostalgia and not ""getting with the times,"" but what I\'ve observed is that newer sonic games lack the direction and the integrity that older games had. And no, I\'m not talking about the genesis games, they were archaic bare-bones platformers that most people only really like because they liked it when they were kids (not that that\'s a bad thing).\n\nThe adventure games, Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic 06 in a timeline where it\'s actually good, Colors, Unleashed (sort of?).\nThey had a charm that Forces certainly doesn\'t, and now Sonic Frontiers is lacking in as well.\n\nThe characters\' personality and voices have all been subdued, made background to the gameplay loop which would be a mistake even if the gameplay loop was good (which it arguably is not). Sacrificing the story and characters is not only pointless but has not contributed to any inalienable quality found in this game that wasn\'t present in the games previously listed under the category of ""the good ones."" Essentially we\'ve been forced to adapt from good story, mid game to bad story, mid game. That\'s not a tradeoff, it\'s a downgrade. Sonic sounds okay, I guess? But Tails and Amy are unrecognizable, especially Amy. And her dialogue has suffered too, losing any of the spice that came with her obsessive personality, now she\'s just one of sonic\'s friends with no distinguishing traits of any kind (other than she\'s the only girl, I guess?). Tails on the other hand seems to have completely reverted to Forces\' ""point-ass-at-threat-and-cry"" mode with weak dialogue and again: no real personality trait other than being friends with Sonic. Talis is an inventor, he made the Tornado, he is both useful and interesting...but not in this game. I have not yet seen any other cameos, but I\'d imagine they probably aren\'t much better, as they exist nowhere in the promotional art. Eggman is here, also weakened and frankly lacking in his comically exaggerated manner. His role in the plot seems to be mostly arbitrary here, not unlike Forces and the general trend away from the formulaic Sonic vs. Eggman plotlines (which can be a good thing, it\'s just not one here).\n\nThe gameplay, the thing that SONIC TEAM has supposedly mastered here, is only slightly better than forces, and is not better to an extent to excuse the black hole that is the plot and characters. Boost is back. I feel I need not say more but I will anyway. They ALMOST removed it in favor of the spin dash, but I guess that would\'ve been to difficult. There\'s now a maximum limit for rings in the free-roam """"""open world,"""""" set to 400 that can be upgraded as you play. The only problem is that reaching 400 rings stored (assuming you\'re not a complete bot) is incredibly easy and I did it in 10-15 minutes (and that\'s after being hit a few times). Rings after this limit are pointless, completely pointless. There is no score system in the hub world, and you don\'t gain XP for collecting rings past the limit, so ring hunting is truly useless since you will get the rings you need on your way and hit the cap for it anyway before you get the chance to upgrade.\n\nSERIOUSLY. It\'s not hard. The levels already do this and they\'re like a minute long. JUST REMOVE THE LIMIT FOR RINGS. IT IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE.\n\nThere\'s also a dumbass skill tree now? So you can unlock different moves as you play, which is stupid because Sonic has always had a high skill ceiling with basic mechanics that are given to you from day 1, level 1, meaning that beginners won\'t have to focus on unlocking moves they don\'t know how to use, and pros can use those expert level moves immediately instead of having to artificially wait?\n\nThat\'s what this game is, by the way: just a bunch of artificially waiting. Cutscenes that look less polished than gameplay, random and pointless grind rails and speed boosters to make you think you\'re playing a sonic game, boss intros for enemies I beat in 30 seconds, time spent in menus looking for the one thing the tutorial won\'t shut up about unlocking or changing, tutorial missions that are unskippable and require constant input for things you already know how to use demonstrably, LEARNING THINGS YOU\'VE ALREADY BEEN TAUGHT 3 TIMES.\n\nHey do you know how to homing attack? It\'s not jump anymore, silly! It\'s X.\nOh cool. Got it.\nHey do you know how to homing attack?\nYes, I\'ve been doing it for 15 minutes now I\'ve got-\nIt\'s not jump anymore, silly! It\'s X.\nYES I KNOW CAN YOU GET BACK TO THE GAME PLEASE?\n...\n...\nHey do you know-\n\nIt is simply a waste of time, like how that bit was a waste of review space. Maybe some of you reading this wish I didn\'t just take up 8 lines for that, like how I wish Sonic Frontiers didn\'t tell me how to perform basic elementary moves 3+ times. And of course, icing on the cake, the game does not look 2022 standards for a triple-A game, the controls are confusing and arbitrarily unintuitive, and worst of all: it seems barely finished and slapped together FNAF: Security Breach style. There are plenty of terrain bugs if you go looking for them.\n\nI have not played through it all, and I very well might. If my opinion changes, I will update and add addendum do my review. But as it stands, Sonic Frontiers is hollow, shallow, barely fun sometimes, and generally not worthy of being added to the ""good ones"" list. Plus it\'s 60 dollars, which is ridiculous.\n\n5/10. SEGA, if you\'re reading this, finish your game, and maybe for the next one try to move away from the hollow lifeless boost model that you seem so desperate to cling to for dear life.', ""THIS IS A LOOOOOONG REVIEW. I HAVE LISTED THE GAME'S PROS AND CONS AND GIVEN AN OBJEXTIVE SCORE BELOW FOR ANYONE SKIPPING THE SENTIMENTAL HOOBLAH.\n\nI still remember the very first game that got me into the world of gaming. I had played exactly 2 games before that game. Transformers: the game and the TMNT 2007 Game. I played those two when i was about 8 purely because of my love for the movies. Then, one day when i was out with a buddy, they kept telling me that they need to buy a game called Sonic Heroes. When we got to a DVD store, he practically forced me to buy and experience a Sonic game for myself. And i ended up with SADX. SADX made me love Sonic. I then HAD to play Sonic Heroes. Next, I HAD to play Sonic Riders. Then i HAD to get a PS2 so i could play Zero Gravity. Before i knew it, i had not only grown to love Sonic, but gaming in general.\n\n14 years later, I just played Sonic Frontiers. I am the biggest fan of Sonic, but i won't defend a game blindly. Forces was awful and i literally forgot about what even happens in it weeks after i finished it. Lost World was a painful attempt to enjoy but a failure to do so ultimately because of the horrible controls. Generations was my top pick for a long time, mainly because i always enjoyed the boost gameplay. Against all odds though, i had never played SA2, and i recently picked it up and played the hell out of it. I loved it. I became a fan of both Boost and SA style of Sonic. Then the classics. I never grew up with them, and always found it difficult to like them. I even enjoyed the 2.5D sections of modern games much less than the rest. But i kept playing Mania, and then realised that the game isnt about dashing through the fastest route on the first try, but enjoying the game as a platformer which you then learn the routes to make a mad dash for the goal. I now love classic Sonic too.\n\nComing into Frontiers, my expectations were a roller coaster. I was extremely hyped, but was apprehensive of it given the track record as of late. Preordered it nonetheless. Saw the reviews and got dissapointed. But went into it excited as ever. What awaited me was the one of the greatest experiences i have ever had with a game. There were moments in the game which i just couldn't even comprehend were real. It's very rare that a modern game manages to capture the magic of what makes gaming so surreal and takes you right back to your childhood. This one, fortunately, absolutely succeeds.\n\nIt's not a perfect game. Flaws Include:\n- Immovable camera during certain boss segments (it shows the indicator, so it's not a technical issue, it was designed that way)\n- running on the green glowing walls is not always accurate, and can send Sonic flying\n- dip in effort for the last island and final bosses and rapid pacing of story after 3rd island\n- clunky menus (ironically the menu to enhance Sonic's speed is the slowest one)\n- a bizarre boss fight near the end\n- very few puzzles. Especially the puzzle leading to the first boss.\n- Pop in. Noticeable, but does not affect gameplay. Did not bother me, but might bother others.\n\nPotential con/pro\n-/+ open world activities and puzzles (depends on whether you enjoy the open world activities and unlocking the map then moving on to the next one and so on. I absolutely loved it, and those giving positive reviews seems to have too. For those people, this is a surreal experience. For those that dont, it will get repetitive and annoying)\n-/+ Cyberspace levels. These are weirder this time around with a lot of variety. Mileage will vary\n-/+ Voice acting. Was jarring for me at first, but later was loving it because it feels on point with the more serious tone of the story. Feels like the characters have matured. Amy is my personal fav, she is an incredible character in this game and each interaction with Sonic and the rest of the gang is a joy.\n-/+ graphics. textures are not the best, but lighting is beautiful. Really gives the look of an abandoned island once populated by an ancient civilisation\n-/+ Barren lands. Again, this one is down to personal opinion. I think it works perfectly with the story. It does not make sense to have NPCs because these are abandoned islands. There are coco, enemies and main story characters everywhere, which do a pretty good job of filling things up. Other than that, i think that the feel and ambience of the islands are exactly how they should be. Besides, it does not pose to be noticeable when you are zipping around.\n\nPros:\n+ Soundtrack. Worth price of admission for this alone. Experiencing a boss unspoilt is the greatest gift anyone could ever give you. Every song with vocals somehow captures what is going through the mind of Sonic as a character in the game, Sonic as a gaming franchise, Sonic Team or any other character in that situation. We don't deserve this.\n+ Stunning meshing of all mechanics in every Sonic game prior to this. Classic gameplay? you got it. Adventure gameplay? you got it. Boost gameplay? you got it. Warehog combos that don't suck? you absolutely got it with a pinch of DMC. Lost world style platforming that doesnt suck? you got it. 2.5D? you got it. Fishing that is actually fun, relaxing and rewarding? you got it. Riding a board? It's just one level, but that is technically a yes.\n+ Clear mechanics. The game clearly establishes the mechanics that are available to the player, and these stick throughout bosses as well. If you have an ability, you can use it. The game also has a nice tutorial section that pops up near any encounter which let's you know what abilities can/need to be used. It is not forced, rather a button prompt - very handy. The loading screens also incorporate the tutorials, again a nice touch. There is only a single occurance of an unestablished mechanic popping up at the very end of the game in the form of a new type of QTE.\n+ Controls are an absolute joy, and this is the best modern Sonic has controlled\n+ Camera. They have put so much effort to making the camera great. I encountered very little problems with the camera. It is snappy and keeps up. Considering the speed of movement, it will always be difficult to have a perfect camera in an open environment for Sonic, as proven by some of the shortcomings of the adventure games. This is an extremely commendable job. They also have a static camera for segments of platforming, and this fixes into place very nicely and there is an indicator to let the player know when they cannot move the camera manually.\n+ Story and interactions. Absolutely amazing and surprisingly intimate story/interactions. A very memorable story on par with SA2.\n+ Moment to moment gameplay loop. With established mechanics and a great combo system, this is a joy to play.\n+ Atmosphere and ambience.\n+ Enemy designs. Some of the best i have seen in a Sonic game. It surprised me how they have managed to incorporate even some of the platforming mechanics into defeating specific enemies.\n+ Future DLC. Some free DLC has already dropped for the game. There is more planned along the way, which will also be free from what has been announced.\n\nThis game is not perfect in the sense that not everyone will enjoy what it has to offer. That is where the reviews come in. But if you are lucky, like me, you will get one of the best experiences of your life with this game. This was literally everything i wanted in a Sonic game. The embodiment of what Sonic is and always has been - fighting through the odds and always coming out on top. That has been true for his character in a given game and as a literal real life franchise. This game contains so many references and throwbacks to real life failures as well, it is just unreal. This is an underdog story, and i am here for it.\n\nObjectively, this game is a 7.5/10 considering everyone's perspective and the enjoyment they will get. But experience wise for those this was made for, absolute 11/10. Welcome back, Sonic!"", 'I often dont leave game reviews, but this is a time where its very warranted. I was obsessed with Sonic when I was a kid, it was one of my favorite series and I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ loved it. However I fell off kinda hard once Black Knight came out, which, I did play and had a lot of fun with it (even though its not good) afterwards I just kinda left Sonic behind for almost 12 full year, not even playing Generations until this year. I occasionally went back to the older games for nostalgias sake. But this game was very different, it really awoke pure nostalgia in me whenever they started to put out the trailers that werent utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It made me pick up the games I ended up missing, and it took me back to a very comfortable place in my life for a bit. Then when it finally came out, it was like Christmas with Sonic Games as a kid all over again. This game came out 2 days before my birthday, and honestly it couldn\'t have been more comforting and nostalgic to play even though with each day I feel old as ♥♥♥♥. Now unfortunately, this games not perfect, there is still a LOT of Sonic jank that seems to persist throughout the boost games and some less than stellar side content. Let me just get the bad stuff out of the way.\n\nThe Bad:\n1. The Cyberspace levels overall are just... kinda bland and dumb. Everyone knows at this point pretty much all of them derive from the older games, and almost none are original, and they LOOK bland because there\'s only 4 aesthetic styles: Green Hill, Sky Sanctuary, City Escape, and Chemical Plant. Those arent inherently bad but it really gets old by the third Island. I will give credit there are some distinct CS levels that arent actually based on boost game levels, like Radical Highway, White Jungle, and Sky Rail, which as someone who loves SA2s stage design to death, was refreshing to what Sonic has been for the last 15 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ years. Also, the physics in these levels SUCK. Unless they\'re the previously mentioned SA2 or select full 3D levels, the 2d ones suck, they suck so bad. The Physics do NOT feel right and the boost does ♥♥♥♥ all. It sucks. It honestly feels worse than Classic Sonic in Forces. The music is still pretty good as always at least.\n2. While the overall gameplay for the Open Zones is really good, man it SUCKS that Sonic still has to rely on boost to go fast. I honestly wish they would have let Sonic run as fast as he does in the Adventure Era.\n3. Everyone ♥♥♥♥♥ on it, everyone hates it, and I used to call it an unreasonable complaint, but man when you\'re playing it and collecting, it becomes very apparent. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Draw Distance. I dont care about it graphically, that doesnt bother me. What DOES bother me is Ill see some collectibles just floating in free air and you wonder ""How do I get that?"" And then you look around and nothing is there because of how short the draw distance is. I get that its a lot of props coming into play but at that point why would you not just build stuff like that INTO the environment? And lets not even get into the fact by the 3rd island 80% of those rail, platform, spring, etc. sections to collect tokens FORCE you into 2D and you CANT get out of it unless you go back. It breaks the pace of trying to run from Point A to B in Open Zone. Its dumb and gets old IMMEDIATELY. STOP HAVING SO MUCH 2D ♥♥♥♥ IN BOOST GAMES.\n4. They REALLY do not make some things in gameplay obvious. Like the parry. The dialogue box makes it feel like what you should be doing is pressing L&R bumpers when a hit is about to hit you which is an option but its really bad. What you SHOULD be doing is HOLDING L&R bumpers to parry. I did not figure this out until BEATING Boss 2 which is ALL PARRY BASED.\n5. As far as content as a whole goes, you can beat pretty much fully complete the game in 20 hrs. Everything. Thats not a bad thing, but for an Open World Style game, there should be at least a decent amount of stuff to do on the side or after main game. Once you beat the game the only thing you get is Arcade mode which is on the main title screen and its JUST the CS levels. Not even some of the minigames from the main story, which as far as Im aware, you can\'t go back and play them whenever you like. The minigames are kinda meh, they\'re not bad they\'re not great. Ones Pinball, and ones Ikaruga. In story they\'re annoying but it would have at least been cool to have them in the Arcade Mode.\n6. Combat while really well made, is kinda stiff when you have everything unlocked. And some are really annoying. Also they take EVERY opportunity to make sure you don\'t get to experience Phantom Rush for more than 3 seconds. Which sucks because Phantom Rush is one of the most satisfying parts of combat.\n7. They really hyped me up with the costumes from preorders, I thought thered be more but there\'s 3 total... classic, SA2 Shoes, and the Adventurer Items. There\'s one for Monster Hunter soon but... that\'s literally it. Why even go out of their way to advertise something like that if there\'s only 3 choices in the entire game?\n\nThe GOOD ♥♥♥♥:\n1. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this is the most fun I\'ve had for boost formula game play period. Again, while it sucks in CS, its AMAZING in Open Zone. This the first time since SA2 that I actually can feel Sonics speed. I still think SA1&2 style movement would have been better. But logically having a walking speed for doing puzzles and what not and Boost for covering ground is the right way to go. Also I found it really neat they implemented the Blue Electricity Speed from the movies. That ♥♥♥♥ dope.\n2. The performance on PC is actually so good! I\'m shocked. I only got 1 place in the game to chug at 1920x1440, 60fps, max settings. The only place where it suffers is cutscenes which seems to be a theme with Sonic PC ports ever since Generations. Not bad but just look grosser compared to gameplay.\n3. The controls are rock solid everything makes sense. My only complaint is man does the right trigger get abused like crazy for boosting.\n4. This game looks extremely pretty. I was worried it would look more Generic and only green, but, there\'s some genuinely pretty areas and ANY area with flora is chef\'s kiss.\n5. The open zone maps are the perfect size. The 1st map kinda teases you with half a damn map but overall it\'s perfect.\n6. The Music. ESPECIALLY BOSS MUSIC. Enough said.\n7. The Boss fights are the best in the 3D games, period. You can not change my mind.\n8. The writing is some of the best period. The last Sonic game to actually make me feel emotions was SA2. Black Knight\'s themes and messages were good, but is hard to take seriously because of the game itself. This however has it\'s own rules and themes and an actually COMPETENT writer. No line in this game made me actually cringe. At worst I felt indifferent. At best I was genuinely touched with character moments and development. E S P E C I A L L Y from Tails. They did Tails some well-deserved justice. They made Amy a very likable character and not an obsessed fangirl of Sonic. They made her an actual character and even tossed the idea of ""Hm, maybe I should go my own way a bit."" Which is a big theme in this game; finding your own path. Which ties into the gameplay therefore making an appropriate theme and not feel out of place. They also didnt make Knuckles a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ idiot again thank GOD. And even shockingly, EGGMAN has some moments where I genuinely got emotional and get to see a side of Eggman not seen since (like a broken record) SA2.\n9. I did not run into a single major glitch in the 20 hrs I played. Not one. Well ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ done Sonic Team.\n\nI cant recommend this game enough if youre a Sonic fan, or not even. Its just a very good game and its the best step in the right direction since Generations. Please support this game, we need more Sonic games like it, or even ones that will evolve into better games. Thanks Sega for a great B-Day gift, please make more like this.']"
