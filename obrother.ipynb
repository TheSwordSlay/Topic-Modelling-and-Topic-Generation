The combat is kind of like they took the idea of Shadow\\'s combat from Sonic \\'06 but made it, uh... good, and added a lot of spectacle, it\\'s not anything ground breaking, but the system works well and makes for fun, albeit pretty easy combat, even on hard difficulty (let\\'s just hope for the next Smash Bros they look at this game and give Sonic a better moveset). Sonic has stats and a skill tree now and I\\'m here for it, though I did find I had the skill tree fully leveled before the halfway point of the game, which isn\\'t necessarily bad, but maybe they could\\'ve either made skills cost more, or made it so skill points could go toward other things after you\\'ve leveled the skill tree fully (I.E make it so you can buy items from Big with skill points after fully leveling, or make it so you can level your stats with skill points a la Dragon Dancer\\'s Mask in Sekiro since I have like 80 skill point to spend on nothing) The music is, well it\\'s a Sonic game, the music was always going to be incredible, and Sega Sound Team did not disappoint. As far as the story goes, while it\\'s nothing to write home about, I can really appreciate how the side characters were written, especially Tails who had in previous games lost all his character development from the Adventure series was done well, and they even called themselves out on how Tails got did dirty in previous 3D titles, Knuckles isn\\'t just a big bumbling doof anymore, and Amy has a personality outside of her pining over Sonic. The Kocos (Korok+Chao=big money cute bois) are adorable and fun to find, nothing else to mention there without getting into spoiler territory. Without getting deeper into story elements but Ian Flynn did well by the characters many of us grew up with, which is a refreshing change from the last 20 years of Sonic writing, and if you come in expecting a story like that in Forces you\\'ll be pleasantly surprised that it\\'s not bad at all, despite some minor pacing issues.\\n\\nThe bad?\\nTo be honest there is not much I straight up didn\\'t like about this game\\nThe biggest issue for me, and probably pretty much everyone else would have to be the a-g-g-r-e-s-s-i-v-e environmental pop-in, to be honest (think SA2\\'s culling but it happens in front of you instead of behind), the game would have been well served with a few more months in the oven for optimization, but this is by no means a deal breaker, and I\\'m sure a patch will drop that alleviates the worst bits of it before too long; most AAA titles come out a little gooey in the middle these days and Sonic Frontiers is no exception to that trend, especially since it launched multi platform. Along that same line, some character animations are kind of stilted and wooden, looking at you, Sonic\\'s walk cycle, and the in engine cutscenes can see some kinda awkward looking interactions between characters, but nothing too jarring, again, the pop-in is the biggest issue, especially when the camera pans over a large area, you\\'ll see grass rendering as the camera comes up to it. Speaking of cutscenes, there are too many, putting the gears into portals has a cutscene, going in and out of cyberspace levels has one, unlocking the emeralds has one, then it loads into another cutscene of Sonic putting said emerald... somewhere, I got sick of seeing cutscenes pretty early in my playthrough, the biggest offender being the \"Sonic has max rings\" one, which can kind of take you out of the action if you\\'re in a platforming challenge and get up to max in the air, since it triggers the unskippable cutscene as soon as you land, the other issue with the cutscenes is that in many of them a few UI elements will stiil be on screen which I found a bit questionable. The game is also a little over tutorialized imo, but this is a trend of modern Sonic so I can\\'t be too critical of this, especially since these games are mostly marketed towards children. The back half of the story is... without getting into details/spoilers, is a little rushed, you\\'ll see what I mean when you get there, but I don\\'t want to spoil so you\\'ll have to find out for yourself. Last issue I have is that the camera can sometimes run away from you when passing certain enemies, one specifically rises into the air, and if you\\'re passing too close it takes the camera with it, which I found a little annoying even though 99% of the time the camera works great.\\n\\nOther thoughts/gray areas\\nI get why they did this, but Sonic has zero momentum, man stops on a dime from top speed, it\\'s a little jarring visually, but mechanically makes sense because you could skip vast portions of the game were this not the case, but I\\'d love to see a \"momentum mode\" post game so you can really romp around the open wo- open zone lol. Top speed Sonic can get flung off low to the ground level geometry if he hits it at the right angle, and I\\'m pretty sure the trick system was implemented specifically to cover up how Sonic can kind of wig out when you launch off of some things, it\\'s a little weird looking but it\\'s a lot of fun to find spots where you can launch Sonic high and far, or just cause him to ragdoll by flinging him off of a rock. Most scripted running sections can be bypassed if you don\\'t hit the first dash pad or spring to initiate it, this can cause issues with some challenges, but isn\\'t a bad thing per se\\n\\nMovement: A\\nCombat: A\\nCamera: A\\nLevel Design: A\\nGraphic: C\\nMusic: S\\nStory: B\\n\\nOverall you\\'re looking at a very fun experience with tons of nods to older games, restructured older stages in the form of cyberspace, and a phenomenal OST. I hope Sega sticks with this model of game going forward, and even if it needs a few tweaks here and there, this is a fantastic proof of concept and has me hopeful for the future of the games I grew up with solid 8/10 game for me and I will be replaying it in the future, highly recommended', \"I 100% this game on my first playthrough which took about 22 hours and boy was it fun. The 5 year wait was definitely worth it and this game is a great start for the return of the series. The visuals are amazing, the music hits hard as always, the story was solid with good writing this time around and the gameplay wasn't difficult but pretty fun to play. Finishing off this game, I really want to see more of this and I can see the next Sonic game continuing on with this and if done in a good time span with the right work, it would be really amazing.\\n\\nVisuals\\nStarting off with the visuals, they look absolutely amazing. These are the best visuals we've gotten in a Sonic game since Unleashed and they really did this well. The textures mostly look very crisp and the detail in the environments look great with dynamic weather and time of day. The shadows being cast by the sun do jump as time progresses, but it isn't a big deal. The biggest issue I have with and the one that practically everyone is talking about is the pop-in. It is really distracting and there should have been at least some efforts to prevent this. A change in LOD or fade could've been added. Being able to change the render distance in the settings would've been even more great. On my RTX 3070 at 1440p, this game doesn't use my GPU beyond 50% so it'd be great if I were able to crank it up to render as much as possible with a smooth framerate. The graphical options are pretty mild, with only some adjustments available. The presets only are low and high and framerate is capped to 60FPS. The cutscenes are also capped to 30FPS for some reason; Not a big deal, but it did bother me. The story cutscenes do look a little low quality for me. I wasn't sure if this was the game or if I was just seeing it like that when it wasn't. The animation for them also seem to vary. In a good amount of them the character movements look great while in others it looks stiff like a fan animation. The motion blur in some scenes also adds on to this effect. In terms of animation involving gameplay, they all look great and fluid. The Super Sonic transformation animation is pretty mid and could definitely look better.\\n\\n\\nThe gameplay is pretty fun and despite the combat having a lot of button mash, I find it fun pulling off different combos. I played on hard mode and some of the enemies were a challenge, and more so later on in the game. However, they weren't too hard overall and I do with they were more difficult to defeat. Would've been cool if the parry was timed (Which is what I thought when I first started just to find out it's not). All you have to do is wait for the attack and it makes it quite OP. The puzzles were fairly simple overall but did get a little tricky later in the game as well. I find it weird that there are no controller vibrations for springs, stomps, etc. Exploring in the open world environment was pretty cool. Just going around doing some platforming and getting tokens was enjoyable throughout the game for the most part for me, it did start to drag off around the end of the game at the last island for me though. The bosses around the island were cool but I do wish there was more variety and difficulty as said before. The main island bosses are FIRE. That's all I need to say for that. The leveling up system for speed and rings takes ages and should be adjustable in increments by the player. The same should be done for defense/power upgrades. Big fishing is cool as well for farming and the detail on the underwater creatures is quite something..\\nCyberspace wasn't bad overall but it could've been better. They took stages from previous games which I personally didn't mind. I just wish it was something other than Green Hill, Chemical Plant, Sky Sanctuary, etc. Would've been cool to see something like Flying Battery, Wave Ocean, Adabat, etc. Sonic is also pretty slippery in it and it really shows in some stages which makes it annoyingly difficult to complete some missions.\\n\\nIan Flynn really did it this time; The story and dialogue was great this time round. In my opinion, the best we've got since Unleashed. It's nothing really complicated or amazing but I really liked the character interactions on this one with Sonic & Knuckles being my favorite. They are all portrayed well here with Knuckles is finally no longer a joke. Overall jokes are also no longer being thrown out in the dialogue commonly. The references to the previous games go crazy here and I really like seeing that as a Sonic fan; it feels good seeing things tie together. Solid story overall and it was a little darker than expected but nothing crazy or amazing to be honest.\\n\\n\\n\\nSonic is finally back and as long as the quality of this game is the minimal from here on out to eventually be improved upon, the future is looking really good! If you're a Sonic fan you'll definitely love it and I recommend it at it's current state. The shortcomings of the game are not hard to be overlooked and do not damper the whole experience. If you're not a Sonic fan but a gamer, I recommend waiting for a sale. I do wish there was more to do after finishing the game, but after doing everything, there isn't anything to do afterward. I give this game an 8.5/10.\", \"The exploration is fun, but the boss fights and subspace just suck. the popin makes it hard to figure where some of the platforming starts in the exploration and you initially move way to slow feeling like your run isn't much faster than walking.\\nedit: my refund was denied so i might as well try to continue\\nedit 2: after beating the game my opinions still stands for the most part. the optional bosses are mediocre and the 2 terrible ones are squid and tank and the only interesting mandatory boss is the 3rd zone's boss but for that place it's the opposite of the rest of the game where exploring that zone is just awful and then the 4th could have just been a cutscene instead of a waste of a zone. i feel as though by making so many things optional they spread the game out too thin and didn't put the right effort into making the good bits better and removing the bad, most of the minigames are needlessly timed and just not good. i've had trouble when the game decides to force 2d sections into the exploration areas in which they just bugs out and not work or decides to have 3d controls while being locked in 2d camera worse is on those green climbing platforms where it doesn't matter which way i push he will only clime to the sides of it and fall off. if you die in the subspace levels that don't have checkpoints the timer still continues despite you having to start all over anyway. i think that instead the subspace should be mandatory for advancing the plot no more of those friendship tokens or whatever they are and the same with chaos emeralds and instead you get 2 chaos emeralds per zone except for the final so your not going super and then losing it in the next area and have 1 hidden and 1 through the boss and allow the player to play as supersonic after getting them all also not forcing them to fight the final boss after getting the 6th on in the final zone. leveling up speed and rings are both way too slow and make no sense the max speed and ring should just be default and the only things you should be upgrading are damage and defense. combat isn't great and you'll get all purchasable powers by the mid of zone 2 just through standard play with the only reason you'll ever engage in it is for the bosses, to get rid of nearby enemies just to be able to save or use your map or achievements and it's more annoying that starfall events respawn all enemies and bosses, especially since you don't need that many gears to unlock all the subspaces. you'll also max out you fishing coins after like 3 or 4 star fall events and the final zone's fishing will load you up on fishing token allowing you to buy your way to max level in everything and even just skip everything by just buying everything you need. most annoying thing is that you gain fast travel after completing all the challenges that reveal the map but the last 2 zones will be put them in locations you cannot reach until later in the game preventing the ability to fast travel outside of fishing the 2 scrolls, which i think needing to do that in every area is idiotic and should just be unlocked by doing it once in any fishing location and it doesn't need to be 2 scrolls should just be one. the story is ok, but it definitely doesn't carry the game enough to want to continue and i almost quit after the 3rd zone if it wasn't for the last going back to being like the first 2. it's crashed on me 3 times throughout my entire playthrough. i hope the next game focuses on the good aspects and is generally a more focused game. i could only recommend this game when it's like $20 or less since it really just feels like a tech demo for future sonic games. if i were to come back to this game it would be for the updates or heavily modded.\\n\\nThis bit is my review for another story. playing as amy and tails was fun, but knuckles was just terrible his glide is awful and if you miss the platform good luck trying to turn around and get anywhere near where you were. the animation for entering knuckles's glide and tails's mech and fly are annoying and just get in the way of using it outside of using knuckle's beginning glide animation to cheese the jump rope challenges, though the mech is really good. knuckles should also be able to climb any surface and not just red textured version of the blue/green ones sonic can run up and his grab onto said surfaces needs to be fixed as most times it looks like he isn't only for him suddenly latch on while other times just rams his head into it without grabbing it and if he even slightly touches anything or the end of it he'll slide down or just let go one time i was launched off of it for only bumping knuckle's head against the lip above the red platform and i can't tell you how many times i'd hold down on my control stick only for knuckles to still go up. tail's lack of a homing attack when all other's have one causes some platforming to suffer as your too used to having one and while i understand setting everyone besides sonic to base level 1 with little upgrades it does make starting a bit of a struggle though the star fall event does make gaining those levels easy, i still think all the abilities that sonic has should automatically be unlocked for the rest of them and all the future levels go into their unique stuff and not their basic attack. i gave up on the first trial tower and i implore sega to fire whomever made them or at least ban them from any form of level design. finally the spin dash was a nice addition except that once you let go of the button/trigger you lose all momentum you had, though i guess that's nothing new for this game. i would hope any level designer besides those that worked on this dlc make future games because if these guys are going to make future sonic levels then sonic's future looks bleak.\\nedit: i've read that it's recommended to switch to easy for the towers i'll try that and continue, but i'm leaving what i said earlier as i shouldn't have to change difficulty because of poor design. After doing so i can say that's how the towers should have been maybe with some added checkpoints on any difficulty it would have been fine if it weren't for the trials at the top. For the trials it lowers all your levels back to 1 and removes almost all your abilities and have such a tight time limit that it's almost impossible. All i can say is that while knuckle's bit wasn't fun, sonic's is a nose dive in quality as the towers are just pure trash that clearly haven't been tested and this entire bit need a lot more time in development. my recommendation for this is only play for the amy and tails bits, rush through knuckles to get to tails and quit once your playing sonic as the rest of it is horrendous. i quit on the snake trial and i'll be seeing if mods may fix this problem in the future. Sega needs to stop doing the bethesda thing where modders have to fix their game and actually make a complete sonic game without stupid problems.\"])],\n",

Frontiers has Unleashed the new direction for Sonic & Knuckles to go in. This is now my new favorite 3D Sonic game and I had to replay my entire collection of Sonic games to come to terms with that.\\n\\nI completed the game initially with momentum physics mods but, upon replay, I think the game is best unmodded. Exploring the islands with Sonic feels great like swinging around in Manhattan as SpiderMan feels great. Especially with the ability to listen to music tracks from the series while you do it! You can customize Sonic\\'s top-speed, acceleration, turn speed, boost speed, and more in the Options which allows you to tailor the way Sonic handles to fit your skill level (turn it all to max babyyy). The open world aspect of the game is done well as a collectathon with challenges gating each collectible (a challenge is just normal Sonic gameplay triggered by a spring, rail, boost panel, etc). Challenges chain into each other and lead you all around the island(s) while feeling like one giant Sonic level. The first three islands are fantastic although the last two feel like the team ran out of time and could have used more visual variety and care. Here\\'s hoping the next game in this format gets more time in the oven!\\n\\nSomething the game does extraordinarily well is how easy it is to be Sonic and to not fall to your death over-and-over again. This is a gripe that many have with Sonic games in the past and my favorites are guilty of this problem as well. The best Sonic games are traditionally unforgiving platformers that are difficult to master and require you to practice to look/feel good. I didn\\'t realize this was an issue until I went back and replayed my favorites. This one, however, is much more accessible. The game slows you down when you jump, slows you down when you enter a 2D segment, and the camera highlights the obstacles you need to overcome in time which allows you to react with fine movement control. In the older games, you often just have to memorize what comes next to succeed but you don\\'t have to do that in this game thanks to these guard rails. What if you still make a mistake? No worries, falling is just a \"woopsie, guess I\\'ll go this way instead\" moment unless you absolutely need to get somewhere specific for the story. I personally found myself doing most challenges and gameplay segments flawlessly on my first attempt since I know the Sonic formula; no memorization required.\\n\\nAnother thing this game does very well is that it will gate certain areas, like a higher elevation or distant land, or chaos emeralds behind gameplay challenges. This means you have to chain bouncing off springs, grind rails, running up walls, and hitting boost panels at high speed to access these areas. The game features 3D gameplay primarily that sometimes segues into 2D like Sonic Generations; this transition feels natural and the boost gameplay is at it\\'s best here too. These challenges vary in length, some are just quick 5-30 second segments and others may take 1-5 minutes like an actual Sonic level. My favorite challenges are the latter but the bite sized gameplay segments are sprinkled all throughout each island so you are always within arms reach of something that will send you flying in the air. Speaking of which, try a boost jump off a rail that has an upward incline to fly whenever. There are a lot of interesting little gameplay quirks to discover to continue momentum.\\n\\nThe game also features combat and RPG elements in the form of stats. I recommend playing on hard difficulty and not leveling up your stats at all because the gameplay is pretty easy (Sonic is meant for kids after all). The combat is kind of like a simplistic character action game with more style than substance; very easy but it looks cinematic and feels good. If you are expecting complexity like Devil May Cry here then you are silly because this is just a Sonic game. This is more like Easy Automatic mode in Devil May Cry with spammable special moves that can stun lock bosses if you know how. Speaking of which, the boss battles are some of the best in all of Sonic history and the music for these scenes caught me off guard but I ended up loving it. Quality dips off toward the last quarter of the game in this regard however and there is planned DLC to fix this.\\n\\nBest story in a Sonic game since the Adventure series. I was resistant to the story at first (and to the game as a whole to be honest) but it grew on me once I gave it a chance. I actually got emotional at the end of the game and I wasn\\'t expecting that. The music also is really good here despite Jun Senoue not composing any of the pieces.\\n\\nLet\\'s talk about something called CyberSpace for a second. This game has some classic Sonic levels inside it, 30 to be exact. These levels are scattered across each island and award you a necessary collectible for progression. 23 of these levels are literal 1 to 1 remakes of other levels from the different 3D Sonic games except with generic Green Hill or Chemical Plant zone backgrounds/textures. So most of these levels should be familiar if you\\'re a fan of the series. It is a good thing to revisit some older games\\' level design with modern controls but I wish they used the actual art assets from the games they were borrowing from. It is also a bummer that these levels are separate from the open world. I would personally cut the CyberSpace levels in the next game and instead integrate them seamlessly into the open world. The CyberSpace basically feels like jumping into a painting in Super Mario 64 except Mario moves a little bit differently and most of the levels are remastered editions of levels you played in a previous game; they also only last a minute or two each. These levels provide the classic Sonic arcade rush experience and were a change of pace but I wish Sonic controlled the same as in the open world in these levels.\\n\\nI like this game. I had fun. This was the most fun I have had with Sonic in a long time and it gives me hope for the future of the series. This was a solid first attempt but I do think that Sega can do even better next time. I hope the developers will choose to make the game truly open world as opposed to using separate maps and will add more variety to each area\\'s design. I also hope they will add more area types to explore (underwater, running on water, highway, snow, board areas, etc). I would also like to see the length of a CyberSpace level baked into the open world environment. It would be really exciting to, for example, hit a spring panel which launches you into the air where you are then picked up by a helicopter and now you are beginning a Speed Highway level segment which connects you to another area (or you rip off a piece of the helicopter to use as a board for a City Escape segment etc). Going back would be an alternate or parallel version of the level. One can always dream.', \"So.. Sonic frontiers. I have a lot to say about this title and gonna be honest? It's a good game, but could've been better, but I feel like SEGA and sonic team tried to rush this for the holidays which isn't anything surprising since sales do better during that time period but it does hinder the overall experience.\\n\\nNow let's go by one thing at a time. First, the islands/hub world. I think it's the best part of this game, the second one being my favorite out of the bunch and I REALLY wish they've done more with the islands because I can see the potential with what they have, I really think them saying this game is 'open world' is a bit misleading, I would say it's a more of a 'sandbox' kind of game. Basically think about it like how mario odyssey is, large open levels that you can explore and go collecting moons. That's how frontiers is approached, with that type of game philosophy. But now with that in mind, what they have is good, even with the weird pop ins here and there but I felt like they've could've expand it more by adding more variety than just oh here's the platforms and the rails. I wanted to so that you can BUILD the islands to traverse through, the puzzles SORT OF do that, but they only add rails and reveal the map. It would've been cool if as you progressed through the story or do the cyberspace levels, you add onto more of the map. Because you can have so much fun with the hub worlds, I had a fun time just blast through the place with what they had and hell, I felt like I was playing sonic adventure 1 with the amount of speed you can have, especially if you get it juuust right and you ZOOM towards where you want to head. It's easily my favorite part of the game\\n\\nSecond, the combat and enemies. I will admit, the combat is pretty repetitive and can be pretty brain dead if you want to just spam the attack button but since you actually have moves now, you can be flashy with what you wanna pull off. Sure it's sometimes a simple 'hold this or press this' and you can do the move, but it's more of the flashiness of it and seeing sonic perform these moves makes it so cool, but I do wish they could've expand on the combat more because I do see some lost potential in there, since it is pretty easy to make it out before you're even at the mid point of the game. As for the enemies? The variety is there and I do enjoy what they have, the mini bosses on the hub world are pretty entertaining and as the more fodder enemies they fit what island they're from. But where the game really shines? The titans, they are so fricking cool, just seeing super sonic handle a fricking evangelion unit while having some kickass music blasting. Easily the highlight of the bosses and does make use of the combat a lot better than the mini bosses, but they're also pretty easy for the most part. Since all of have to do is get close enough and go ham on them but I think what makes people go crazy is when you finish them off. They're so good, my personal favorite being the third island again. I won't spoil it any further, but once you see it- You'll feel like a little kid again.\\n\\nThe Cyberspace levels and controls; The controls are. The controls feel janky in this title, especially if you're going from generations - forces - frontiers; like for example, the boosting is tweaked so that you aren't so ridiculously fast like in generations but when you jump you basically lose all momentum, especially if you try to air boost. The air boosting got nerfed in this title, so you can't use it that much anymore and the homing attack has this delay on it so you can consistently homing attack anymore; but it does have a nice perk to it. It's called homing attack cancel, basically cancelling a homing attack to a boost and BOY DOES THAT GIVE YOU A LOT OF MOMENTUM REAL QUICK. It's a lot of fun if you get it down consistently. But then here comes the worst part of the game; the Cyberspace levels, now I get that they're supposed to be from Sonic's memories but they are so short. It has the forces problem where the level ends before it can even start, and it's no different here. I can honest to god name like only two levels that are only past the 2;30 mark but even then that's pretty short compared to what we had previously. And you feel so slow when you try to not boost since also the boost now has a meter that isn't charged by rings anymore or destroying badniks. I can get their intentions with the Cyberspace levels; bite sized tradition levels but I honest to god wish that they didn't do that and instead made it so that the levels felt like actual levels instead of it suffering like forces and ending before it begins. The only thing that carries the Cyberspace levels is the music but other than that, I can't say that I didn't enjoy the levels but there is a lot missing that makes you feel empty.\\n\\nStory, VAs and Music; Now I know people have a history of hating Ian Flynn but I do think he did the characters much needed justice by actually making them characters in the story. They don't feel so one sided anymore and actually show that they DO have faults and acknowledge their mistakes. Sure some of the dialogue is a bit awkward but this game has done them much more justice than the past decade, especially sonic. Sonic's no longer a snarky guy who's constantly spouting one liners. I feel he's back to his former self with how they portray him. And I do think that the voice actors did a good job, especially Roger and Mike. It was weird at first hearing a more deeper voice of Sonic but it did fit with this setting that the game chose. And the eggman codecs? They were VERY JUICY and I feel like mike has sold it in that as well. Amy's voice actor sounds flat a lot of times but I did she did okay, Tails is on the same levels as Amy's VA but she was less awkward with voicing tails and the interactions felt much better than Amys, as for knuckles? I think he did a good job too, especially with the small interactions he has with sonic. They were very good, Sage's VA was pretty monotone but given that she's an AI and all? I think she did a great job with what she had. Now the story- Well... I can say it did more than the previous titles, like the mystery with the ancients was there and it made me think like I couldn't believe there was some EVEN before the echidnas and whatnot and I desperately wished that they've gone more in depth with it because Sage as a villain- She didn't REALLY do anything other than tell sonic he was going to fail on his quest and it shows as near the end of the game I can tell the game was just rushing for the ending. Spoilers for the ending of the game here! But enough about that. Now time for the music- I really enjoyed the tracks they had! Too bad for most it was short due to the cyberspace levels, but at least we had the fishing and titans. God I love the titan's songs so much.\\n\\nFinal thoughts; This game is a 7.5/10. This game could've been great but it was rushed, now would I pay 60$ for it? Nah. Definitely get it on a sale, but I do recommend on giving this game a try. And if you like it, that's good and if ya don't? that's okay. But definitely looking forward to what sega has to offer in store in the next title.\", \"Sonic Frontiers is one of THE games ever made!\\n\\nOverall, I recommend buying this game, especially if you're already a starved Sonic fan, assuming you still give a ♥♥♥♥ about this series somehow. If you're not already a fan, perhaps wait for a sale. I do believe £50 is pricey when you compare this title to similar games both on and outside of Steam. Just keep your expectations in check. The high points are amazing, but man do the lows suck ass.\\n\\nIn a number rating, I'd just BARELY give this game a 7/10. It would be a 6 if not for the context that this is the first GOOD 3D Sonic game in over a DECADE now, and I greatly respect Sonic Team for actually having some ambition like the old days. Despite 5 years of development, it is clear they had many troubles making this after needing to scrap everything and start over. This game IS unfinished, it's obvious especially later in the game, but despite everything, I still love, and more importantly, respect what this game turned out to be in the end, again given the greater context of Sonic's game history.\\n\\nHere's a rough list of things I liked and didn't like from the top of my head, some points include spoilers:\\n\\n-- Liked --\\n- The writing is some of the best in the series. Nothing groundbreaking for the writing world, but for Sonic it's a massive step up. There are various scenes in the world where he can talk with his friends in ways you'd actually believe to make sense. Crazy! I do wish more was happening during these moments outside of just standing around and talking, but it's a start.\\n\\n- The boss fights. With the exception of the final 2, they rule. Don't spoil yourself on them. Just play them.\\n\\n- I do believe the combat is serviceable, I just wished for something more involved.\\n\\n- The music. No ♥♥♥♥ the music is amazing, it's Sonic. Again I must point to the boss fights as those tracks go HARD. It's ridiculous but I love it.\\n\\n- A lot of people don't like these, but I actually liked the Cyberspace levels overall, but I would change a lot about them. I think S ranks need to be FAR harder to achieve, the red rings should actually take effort to find, and the controls should be IDENTICAL to the open world controls. For some reason, Sonic's physics are completely different in Cyberspace in all the worst ways. I understand why they are disliked, primarily for the fact they are in every way WORSE than Unleashed and Generations levels, but I still had plenty of fun with these. Still better than Forces lmao.\\n\\n- Fishing! :D\\n\\n- There's a lot of sections where you'll be playing some kind of mini-game to beat a challenge. Random world challenges do this and so do some guardian fights. Some will likely hate this but I ended up really enjoying it, with the exception of one instance seen in the dislikes list. Overall is really reminds me of Nier Automata.\\n\\n-- Disliked --\\n- The open world level design is bland and boring. Still fun to run around in, but I'm not a fan of the massive disconnect between the world geometry and all the random rails and boosters everywhere. It just looks kinda bad and doesn't make any sense.\\n- On the topic of the open worlds, Chaos Island, the third island in the game. It. Is. BAD. The game often locks you into predefined paths that are more like traditional Sonic platforming challenges. That's what those rails and springs are. But it's HORRIBLE in Chaos Island. Hard to see, or outright HIDDEN booster pads sending you in a completely different direction, locking you into a 2D section you can't escape from, and when you try to frantically get out, you hit ANOTHER one. It's not this bad for the other worlds, Chaos Island is just by far the worst in the game. The boss rules though.\\n\\n- Graphical issues. The game ran fine for me, but the pop in is awful. I was hoping for an option to reduce it on PC but n o p e. It very often disrupts gameplay too, as platform challenges RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU can sometimes not load in visually, so you can't see where you need to go. Remember you travel quite fast in this game too. Not a good mix as you can imagine.\\n\\n- Invisible walls. WHY????? Open world game locking off large chunks of the map for no reason. OK.\\n\\n- Ignore this point if you REALLY want to see the true final boss completely blind, but it sucks ass anyway so you shouldn't care tbh. The final boss is awful. Minor gameplay spoiler here, not story related. The gameplay of the true final boss is nothing like the rest of the game. You go from Sonic to TouHou for no reason at all. I like bullet hell shoot-em-ups, but ♥♥♥♥ this. It isn't even cool to look at. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SPHERE. Not to mention the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ monologue it goes on every time you fight it, and if you lose, back to the beginning! It's long and annoying and uninteresting as hell. Terrible way to end the game when you have so many kickass Titan fights.\\n\\n- This game's physics are janky as hell. I fairly often clipped through the geometry of some guardians and titans. Sonic just randomly decides whether he feels like sticking to the floor like a magnet, or just being launched into the air. The wall running sections are extremely inconsistent. Sometimes he sticks automatically, sometimes you need to hold the boost button just to run normally, sometimes the boost actually boosts and launches you off the wall, sometimes Sonic doesn't even move in the direction you input. Then there's the issue of Cyberspace having different physics entirely, so the skills learned in the world don't apply. It's just a mess.\\n\\n- This game has a parry move. It's lame. You hold both bumper buttons with no timing needed. It also does this annoying thing where it slows time. How is that annoying? There's a guardian fight later on that you MUST parry to beat, but when you do, you're just stuck waiting for it's next move because you can't attack it while in that phase. Repeat until it finishes it's phase. It's just lame design that feels completely untested.\\n\\n- You can level up Sonic's stats, but they take WAY too long. Speed and Ring levels can only be increased ONE AT A TIME using LAGGY menus. It will literally take around 30 minutes to max them out just using the UI alone. Who thought this was a good idea?\\n\\n- The UI in general is just laggy. You need to wait for the game to allow you to select and press a button it presents. There seems to be some arbitrary delay on these actions for some reason.\\n\\n- There's a big issue that comes up in the story that goes absolutely nowhere and is resolved in the exact same scene it became a problem with no real stakes at play.\\n\\n- There's a pinball challenge I really hated but I just hate pinball tbh.\\n\\n- The story cutscenes are just kinda lame. It's all just standing and talking.\\n\\n- I know for a fact there's more to this list but I can't think of them right now. May edit later.\\n\\nOverall, a good game with many issues as said at the start. Just keep your expectations in check and you'll probably have a good time. For once, I'm actually more of a glass half-full guy in this scenario. There's a lot wrong with this game, but it gets quite a lot right, and when playing I felt like the good outweighed the bad just enough.\"])],\n",

Not worth the 60$ price tag or even the 40$ sale in its current state.\\n\\nThis was a unique sonic experience from the start to the end. I won't get too much into the story as this is mostly focused on the gameplay itself.\\n\\n* Movement - Clunky and Unpolished\\n(Disclaimer. I played this with a mouse + keyboard so I can't tell how it feels to play with a controller)\\nIn some parts of the game your movement will feel buttery smooth and amazing and in other parts it will feel like you're playing a souls-like with your feet while blindfolded, let me explain. Usually when your movement is restricted you can enter a flow-like state in parkour areas where sonic feels amazing to control and it's all around a fun experience, the problems come in when you get the constant switching between 2D and 3D or 3D restricted movement and 3D non-restricted movement. The changes happen suddenly and whenever there's not a clear sign that it's gonna occur it can lead to frustration.\\n\\nTurning sonic while jumping is close to impossible without dashing and if you jumped a little bit too far and want to turn around to fix it, too bad. There are 2 ways to dash in this game, with Z to follow coins or with Shift for a general dash. In some parts of the game where you feel like you should use Z dashing to follow coins it can often just lead you to parts where you suddenly fall off the edge and if you're just slightly off having the perfect angle you sometimes follow the coins in the wrong direction instead, the pathfinding needs to be worked on. Normal dashing makes you fly very very far. This is good when you wanna get to places far away, but often I found myself in situations where I thought a dash would do the trick, but it ended up being too far and I had to re-do the entire section.\\n\\n* Combat (Sonic) - Simple, but fun to watch\\nThe game basically plays itself, most fights are usually just pressing the same buttons every encounter, but with cool animations to watch. I found myself switching my attacks often, not because I had to, but because I didn't wanna see the same cutscene play out over and over again. I thought the skill tree would be an interesting part of the game, but it got maxed out pretty quickly and there was not really any sense of accomplishment when getting a new attack. They even have an auto combo feature which I turned off in the options as I wanted some sort of action in the game. And last but not least, parrying is way too overpowered. Why do I just need to hold down two buttons to become completely immune basically every attack in the entire game from any direction and I don't even need to time the release or anything. If you're fighting something and don't know what to do, just use parry and it will probably do something favorable most of the time.\\n\\n* Combat (Bosses) - Chef's kiss\\nI did not expect the bosses to be this good. Every overworld has a select few bosses that each have their unique way of taking them down and even though some of them are repeated, most of the time it's just fun. Squid games and Foretress are probably my favorite overworld bosses as they just look pleasing and feel great to take on. The main story bosses are a mixed bag, some parts of them are amazing while other parts just leave you confused as to what is going on.\\n\\n* Overworld - Aestethically pleasing with eyesores sprinkled everywhere\\nThe overworld design as a base is nice and vibrant. It's not amazing, but it's pleasing to look at and fun to run around in. The ruins and otherworldly technology fits like a nice glove and is fun to explore. But then you have the eyesores. Now I know that the rails, springs, floating platforms, ziplines, treadmills and random crates have a purpose of being parkour sections, but that doesn't make them any nicer to look at. It doesn't feel like any of it was meant to be there and if you take a step back it all just looks like a jumbled mess, not to mention that they also have vertical culling applied to them, so sometimes when you're falling down after a parkour section that took you high up in the air, suddenly a rail pops up out of nowhere. Gameplay wise it's nice to use for travelling or just to have some momentarily fun parkour, but design wise it's awful.\\n\\n\\n* Cyber Space Zones - Awful doesn't begin to describe it\\nOn paper it sounds like a good idea. Classic sonic level designs where you go through a level as fast as possible and with multiple different routes to pick from, nice!\\n\\nNo... just no...\\n\\nOverall these cyber space zones gave me a massive headache, Depth perception issues, restricted to non-restricted movement, Sonic randomly stopping, turning left or right in 3D is close to impossible, dashing off the stage because it's very sensitive, Z dashing into coins don't work after jumping off from rails, some parts that look like they intended for Z dashing are actually not, dashes don't reset when jumping to enemies so often you fall down thinking you had the dash still, locked camera angles, losing all coins when you die even if you respawn at a checkpoint where you had coins before that point on the stage, some stages require close to perfection with the times while others just require you to walk towards the goal at a moderate pace and much much more...\\n\\n2D Cyber spaces: These are the most tame ones as they restrict your movement and a few of them are well designed and fun to play through. The parts I dislike about these are that sometimes it goes from you just cruising along to a precise platformer when you least expect it.\\n\\n3D Cyber spaces: Oh boy, the worst part about the game. You fall off the stage constantly, depth perception leads you to miss targets you thought you'd hit with a dash, why aren't linear parts that are clearly split into 3 sections actually split into 3 sections so you can quickly switch between them. The only way to properly control sonic in these 3D stages is to completely ruin all your momentum and make sure you perfectly line yourself up cause if you're just slightly wrong in what angle you're looking at you can fall off the stage so easily. Whenever I found a cyber space portal I prayed to all that was holy that it wasn't a 3D one, they don't work when you're running fast, there's no clear level design and if you want to experience what a 3D cyber space has in terms of potential, go play Neon White. I got frustrated to no ends with these cyber spaces and it left a sour taste every single time to the point where I hated it whenever I found a portal.\\n\\n\\n* In conclusion: If you can stomach the price, poor movement in certain sections and cyber spaces. Go for it, this game is in its core fun to play. If you can't do that, then don't. This game feels like it's lost, it's attempting multiple different things yet masters none. It left me feeling mildly annoyed and I naively thought it would get better, but it just stayed the same throughout the whole thing. But you know what, the game has fishing and the soundtrack has some bangers. So it's not all that bad I suppose!\", 'So you don\\'t need to read more, the game is both good and fun in my opinion.From Launch////I liked it, I liked it a lot. It really felt like a new take from sonic that feels more like a proof of concept rather than truly being full, but none the less is a great game to just enjoy my time and run around in on multiple playthroughs and makes for some intriguing challenge runs. Some minor complaints I have are how certain upgrades don\\'t feel too worth like upgrading speed doesn\\'t feel like it boosts me at all in any way, and how no matter how many rings I have, if I don\\'t upgrade my defense I\\'m gonna drop em all. The overworld is chalk full of room for you to explore what you can do in the space you\\'re given and how you can get collectibles while getting another. At a point it does feel a little tedious getting a bunch of memory tokens when you can just fish them up, but I do hate seeing something on my map I can get rid of by collecting it. The idea of it being sectioned off in a chapter style was odd getting used to, but it\\'s okay, it would be nice to have a post game super sonic to go around the place with being completely OP(reason why it\\'d be post game). Story was enjoyable, nice to see that they\\'re taking it a bit more serious and making the world more like the people have lived it than just what\\'s happening now, they\\'re characters with memories. Eggman isn\\'t cookie and has a more calming tone, it felt kinda jarring at first, I think they should take more inspiration from the intro of unleashed, but give him more of that menacing flair that the adventure games had, he\\'s the eggman with the master plan, he\\'s got tools that he will use even if he\\'s killing his dignity because his plan has to pull through. The rest are a little mellowed out and just feel more like people. Tails giving a better context for some of the games was cool, knuckles just wanting to be free of his responsibility(he can though, he can shrink the emerald, can\\'t he like back in SA2?) Meta verse is bare bones, but when they either pull a weird level like 3-6, or make something new like 4-4 or 4-8. I will of course talk about the inconsistency that the levels have and how you\\'re faster is some and slower in others, and how sometimes depth perception isn\\'t that great in some. Music slaps like always, another era of sonic music and gameplay it seems to me. They went for a more techno style for the meta verse and they split the rock in the bosses and orchestra in the overworld besides the main song \"I\\'m Here.\" The new beat em up style is cool and I will love to see it refined in future titles. ////The 1st Update////Now to the nitty gritty. The bad stuff in the game post first content update, they haven\\'t fixed the pop in issue that every negative review on this game will not let down. That\\'s the main negative that I see, but I don\\'t have an ultrawide monitor because I think it\\'s pointless, and there isn\\'t an fps cap above 60 which doesn\\'t matter much either.I hate just talking about the bad in a game I enjoy, so let\\'s go over the good stuff. The recent update added two challenge modes for after your first playthrough. Both are rush modes for different things. One is for all of the enemies and bosses and the other is for all of the meta verse levels. Each have you go through each island in their own rush then the final challenge is doing every single one back to back which adds up quickly. In the battle rush it went to ~28 minutes and the meta verse rush going to almost 40 minutes, so it is a huge test of memory about the stages, so take advantage of the ones you\\'re good at to make some good time saves. One REALLY cool thing is that when you do the big challenges you get two things, one is a medal on the menu screen \"similar to stars in FNAF,\" and depending on which one you unlock something extra. The battle rush unlocks extreme mode, an incredibly needed actual hard mode where your rings don\\'t matter and you die in a single hit, in my playthrough so far I haven\\'t gotten to a boss yet, but if it affects there then this will be interesting. As for the meta verse challenge you get to have the power boost that you get in the overworld when you have ring cap, so people that are challenged by 1-2 you have a better chance. Photo mode is what it is, but I don\\'t see myself using it. The jukebox is surprisingly nice and the song choices are pretty good (except that sonic boom isn\\'t on it so it\\'s an L). Jokes aside I love it greatly, but it does give off some GTA 5 phone vibes where you\\'re doing whatever then run into something or off a cliff. Unlocking songs along the way is nice and knowing that they are the same every time is neat, so you can look forward to knowing certain songs are where. Navigating through the songs is weird and would be nicer to do in the pause menu and have the ability to do it in-game could be nice so you don\\'t have to spam the left or up and down to get to a particular song. Edit: So the bosses are effected in the extreme difficulty, so good luck with Giganto and his laser show second phase, just don\\'t do a parry attack and you should be fine. One new thing I noticed was that some meta verse stages are harder to S rank, for example 2-2 used to be 1 minute for an S rank, and now it\\'s 34 seconds, so that small complaint that some had saying it was kinda easy to do now is gone for some of the stages. ////Road map thoughts////I suspect that the next update will be in June. As for the content I would guess there will be time trials to go through areas that feel like stages in each island, a lot on Rhea I would think. The Koco thing I would think is a slight change in that they will have more than just one design on each island. The birthday bash, no idea at all. I will day that end of year on with a new story and *gasp* playable characters. Plural? And how it shows images of the characters in the game, been a while, like a few years? I\\'m guessing it\\'ll be sequel bait and just show the cast doing what they said they wanted to do, or it will be what they saw before sonic saved them from the meta verse.', 'This game is stupid fun, and the best sonic has felt in years. I really wanted this game to succeed, and i was really glad to get my hands on it when it first released. (I initially got the switch version, but since getting a steam deck i got the game on steam too and have been enjoying higher graphics and framerate). Sonic feels awesome, the characters havent felt this alive in a long time, and the overall direction of this game has me really excited.\\n\\nNow, this game is not perfect. Far from it. The general consensus is that this game is a 7/10, and for sonic that is a miracle in the modern day. However this is the most ambitious, fun, and high-inducing 7/10 i\\'ve played.\\n\\nThe movemement in the open zone is really awesome, sonic turns very easily and while boosting you move at a fast pace. You can get a great flow going, moving from obstacle to obstacle. You can run past whatever you dont like, and engage in whatever you find fun.\\n\\nHowever, the pop-in is really noticeable and sometimes ruins the flow of gameplay. There have been times where ive been stopped by an invisible wall from an obstacle that didnt load in yet and it is very frustrating. Additionally, the jump kills any sense of momentum you have. For control, this works great. but for speed, it feels pretty bad.\\n\\nKronos and Ares island were really fun, i loved the ambient music for both of them and i loved how the game let you freely traverse where you wanted to go. There are many mini obstacle courses throughout the islands and you can choose to go where you want, and if something isnt fun you can just leave it. But just moving around and getting collectibles was really fun. And traversing to any part of these 2 islands were very easy.\\n\\nThe same, however, cannot be said for Chaos island. Chaos island had a frustrating amount of forced 2d segments that you were sent into from any spring or dash pad. It was hard to see what was ahead because of the forced perspective, each section felt sluggish, and overall i found myself ignoring these obstacle courses because i was not having fun with them. Whats worse, is that in the previous 2 islands there would be these markers that you could cyloop to get a lot of memory tokens. Chaos island has these too, but instead of memory tokens they are just springs or dash pads that send you flying into these 2D sections uncontrollably.\\nMeanwhile, the map is segmented between a bunch of islands and it is really hard to find out how to get where you need to go.\\n\\nNow most people were upset about Rhea not being a full blown island, but i really liked the break from formula on climbing the towers. The epic music and fun platforming while climbing comically tall towers, all while the dread of watching really grabbed back my attention and made me want to keep playing. And after the mess that was Chaos, when i started ouranos island i was just happy to experience the freedom of kronos island again. It was disappointing to see that it had the same aesthetics, but i still found the last island to be enjoyable.\\n\\nThe combat in this game is definitely new and fresh, but it needs balancing and more incentives. My enjoyment on combat was mixed, sometimes it was very fun and satisfying, sometimes it was a chore. Some of the guardians were really fun to fight! Some of them were just quick time events (looking at you shark) and were far from engaging.\\nMost combat moves learned from the skill tree were just different finishers used by different buttons, but were functionally the same. Or you get sonic boom, which is just \"hold down the trigger to win\". But then you get a really cool ability like quick cyloop, or tricks which are completely separate from combat! There is a lot of potential, but ultimately the skill tree just needs more unique abilities and not just finishers that look different.\\nThe parry is also incredibly overpowered and abuseable, unlike in other games with parries you can just hold it forever with no sense of timing. You can even cheese the jump rope challenges by holding parry midair, you just float motionless in the air and it does not feel like something that should have made it into the final game.\\n\\nBut there is one thing that the skill tree really augments: the titans. The first 3 titans were some of the most fun and excited i have been playing sonic in such a long time. The music is awesome and pumps you up, the moves are flashy and cool, and everything is over the top in such a spectacular way. And unlike previous games where super sonic has a completely different moveset, your combat abilities now stay the same and instead are super flashy and deal massive damage. The first time i faced giganto i had goosebumps and was screaming out loud. It was so exciting.\\n\\nOn replay though, the epicness does kinda dwindle with the knowledge that you can just hold parry and win really easily. There is no downside to using it all the time, there is no timing to it. The wyvern fight was awesome the first time i played it because i had no idea you could parry the missiles, so i had to dodge left and right while constantly moving. Boosting felt like a risk because i could easily get hit. But on a replay i could just hold parry and skip the chase phase entirely once 1 missile gets reflected. Basically: the titan fights are really easy. Once you get over the awesome music and spectacle they really lack any form of challenge, and aren\\'t as fun as when you first faced them. Its also criminal that there is currently no way to replay any of the titans unless you have a save file you save right before the fight. Though hopefully DLC will fix this.\\n\\nCyberspace is a mixed bag, sometimes the levels are really fun and other times they just dont fit sonic\\'s movement well. For some baffling reason they decided to make sonic\\'s turning while boosting in the 3d levels a lot stiffer in cyberspace, which makes playing as intended a lot less fun than it could be. The 2d stages meanwhile are slow and floaty, overall i didnt like them as much\\nHowever, with the unintended mechanic of homing attack cancelled boost, you can go zooming past the stages and it is actually a lot of fun. plus, its easy to pull off, all you need to do is press homing attack then hold the boost before you hit anything. Trying to break the intended path to get a very low time has been the most fun i\\'ve had with these stages. 1-2 especially, with the absurdly tight S rank time it was realy fun to optimize it. Its a shame no other level has such a tight time like 1-2 did.\\n\\nThe music? absolute god tier. every part of the soundtrack is genius, and ive been listening to the different songs all throughout the game on spotify ever since it released. Every cyberspace level has unique music with different styles, theres a freaking lofi track for fishing, the beautiful melancholic music of the open zone, or the adrenaline pumping metal that plays during the titan fights. There is something for everyone here, and as someone with very wide music tastes i appreciate all of it. (except for that one song that plays during that ONE sage cutscene in chaos island, the singing is off key and it sounds like nails on a chalk board to me. i hate it)\\nAnd the music that plays in the credits? The lyrics had me tearing up.\\n\\nso overall? Sonic frontiers is a mix of a lot of things, many of which are fun but could be better. And yet it gives you so much freedom to do what you want, that you can just skip the parts you dislike. Everything about this game makes me really excited for the future of sonic as well as the DLC. Plus, hearing Kishimoto on twitter actively listen to feedback and talk about him wanting to fix problems with the game has me incredibly hopeful. The highs of this game are incredibly high, and while there are certainly an amount of lows in this game, you either forgive and forget, or you can just ignore them entirely and never have to encounter them. 7/10.'])],\n",

It needs work and fixing, but I think that this time that's actually a good thing. Many things are very much not finished: the obvious pop-ins, the weird physics, Cyberspace feeling slow and sticky, the story pacing at times, the world sometimes feels a bit lackluster in versatility, the forced notifications or camera pans towards enemies and so on, but this will all help Sega going forward. They will learn and understand from these mistakes and (hopefully) grow and adapt solutions for these.\\n\\nLooking beyond the flaws of the game, you can feel that they genuinely tried their best to make something more worthwhile to play: first proper open world Sonic game, more intricate combat system, a story that feels like it's inspired by Unleashed and the Adventure games (thank you, Ian Flynn), characters that no longer feel flat, a kick ass OST that (most of the time) absolutely slaps HARD AF, bosses that hype you up and feel exciting to fight against, exploration that always has your attention, a world that feels like it has emotion and expression with a nice aesthetic and many more of said good details. It feels like we're back in the early 2000's of Sonic. It's not perfect, but we're having a good 'ol time with our buddy Sonic again.\\n\\nI could not possibly recommend this to someone who is not a Sonic fan.

But here we are, about a week after release, and even though many of us are still conflicted and confused on what to think about Frontiers, we can all confidently say that Sega, in fact, did not mess up, and that we got a Sonic game we have all been waiting for for a very long time.\\n\\nIt's far from perfect, it's far from the best Sonic game, but I'm sure we can all agree that beyond it's flaws, it's a damn good Sonic game.\\n\\nLet's just hope Sega keeps their promise and keeps improving their quality going forward into this new decade of Sonic.\"])],\n",

Every Cyber Space level are copied level design from other Sonic games. Story reason or not, I find this pretty pathetic. If I wanted to play Generations, then I'd play Generations. If I wanted to play Unleashed, then I'd play Unleashed. Hell, if I wanted to play Sonic adventure 2, then I'd play Sonic Adventure 2. This a full price retail game, this is inexcusable. It doesn't help that Sonic is designed for the open world here, and not these very linear platform heavy stages, that mind you weren't designed with his physics in mind, as they are just copied from other Sonic games. it is clunky. Sonic's jump also isn't very good. Sometimes the game will expect finer movement from you with platforming, and the jump is just not good for it at all. It serves its purpose, but it could be better. The open world is sorta just a very big hub world. Despite being open world, it really is not. The game is incredibly linear. Sure while you can technically go wherever you want, the game will constantly force you into directions that you weren't planning on going. Everything is separate from each other, there is absolutely no smooth transition. The story is sorta boring until I wanna say the 2nd island. It sorta just doesn't give you anything to hook on for the first 4 hours. One big thing that was disappointing was that the bosses did nothing but get worse. The first by far was the absolute best and most fun, after that they just get less and less cool, and the final boss I'd say is completely boring. While not inherently a flaw, I think the physics aren't a great fit either. I'd imagine most if not everyone would love to see a game where you control your speed and how fast you're able to go by mastering the terrain, and not by pressing a button to just go fast. This works in games like Unleashed and Generations, because those are most definitely what I'd call quick time event games. The game benefits from knowing when to use it, and how you want to use it. But in Frontiers, I think it's just unnecessary . This does nothing but make it feel like Generations and Unleashed, but worse. Because it doesn't add anything to the game. Also the visuals are boring, it's just the real world but you plop Sonic and some ancient tech into it. But enough of the negative. Firstly, I love this game, and it was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome. Despite everything I've said, the game manages to be fun. While I don't think it's the best gameplay, it certainly had a ton of effort and passion put into it, and I respect it. The game is fun, a lot of fun, and that's all I can really say about it. I don't exactly know why it's as much fun as it is, but it's fun. They did well with what they had. The first boss at the very least was super ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun, and hype as ♥♥♥♥. 2nd was also good, just not as hype. And for the first time since Unleashed, did the story actually feel epic. Besides the boring first few hours, I quickly became invested in it's plot. And the new character Sage is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ adorable and I love her. The music is an absolute banger too. Good lord, this ♥♥♥♥ is awesome. Never has Sonic felt more like an anime since...idk Black Knight? Anyways, the game has flaws, but damn is it a good foundation. I'm certainly happy with what we got. And I'd even say it's worth the full price. And it certainly makes me super excited for it's sequel. If they keep with this formula, I have no doubt the sequel will be a 10/10. But for now, I'd have to give Frontiers a 7/10. But it's certainly worth it. It may have issues, but I promise you will have fun. And that's my long ass review of Sonic Frontiers. Oh, and the references are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome, and a few made me ♥♥♥\", \"TLDR: Is this game perfect? No. Did I have a lot of fun with it? Yes. Would I recommend it? Yes.\\n\\nI was one of those people who were leery of the idea of an open-world Sonic game and not impressed by the early glimpses we'd gotten. I am pleasantly surprised by just how good and how much fun I've had with this game, but that does not mean it is perfect or free from criticism.\\n\\n★ Gameplay __________________\\n\\nThe gameplay is divided into two major categories - the open world, and the cyberspace stages, which both have a completely different feel.\\n\\nBy and large, the open world feels pretty good. It feels reminiscent of Unleashed, tho lacking in certain aspects of control like the drift. It also employs a combat system that took some getting used to. The idea of being able to parry in a Sonic game is still extremely foreign to me despite having finished the game.\\n\\nAs for the cyberspace stage gameplay, it feels more reminiscent of Forces. That is to say, extremely clunky and precision platforming is an absolute nightmare. I basically played the cyberspace levels enough to 100% them and have no intention of returning. Open-world tho? The first two islands feel SO GOOD to just run around and vibe in. This is the first time since Unleashed where I truly feel like I have a sense of what it would feel like to be in Sonic's shoes, blasting around in whatever direction my whims take me. The third island onward things get a bit frustrating with a lot of forced 2D segments that are difficult to break the camera out of. Is it a dealbreaker? Nah, but it is annoying.\\n\\nAs a final thing to point out, the boss fights at the end of each island are, generally, an absolute spectacle with a couple of exceptions. Also wtf to the hard mode final boss. It's not necessarily BAD but.. VERY VERY not what I expect in a Sonic game.\\n\\n★ Aesthetic __________________\\n\\nHit and miss for me. I do think the open world is gorgeous, but nothing about it feels 'Sonic' to me. I'm also not a fan of the bumpers and rails just randomly placed around the realistic looking open world. Don't get me wrong, I generally find them fun from a gameplay standpoint, but there was absolutely no attempt to integrate them into the island's aesthetic so they just look jarring and out of place. Either they should have been more integrated into the chosen aesthetic, or the overall aesthetic should have been made more Sonic-like. Preferably the former. I would love if an update was made that removed all of them so I could just run around the maps freely without looking at them.\\n\\nFor your more familiar checkerboards and whimsically designed robots if you happen to be missing them, you'll want the Cyberspace levels, but even then you'll just run the same three-four level aesthetics over and over again. It sadly feels very much like they cheaped out on the assets.\\n\\n★ Story __________________\\n\\nThis was the major draw for me. Sonic comic book writer Ian Flynn was chosen for the script, someone the fandom has been calling for years to work on the games. Does the story live up to expectations? Overall, hell yes. The character interactions feel genuine. They feel like actual characters with personalities and relationships and not flanderized tropes spouting one-liners.\\n\\nThe story focused a lot on uncovering the mystery of the Starfall Islands while also working to rescue your friends, along the way dealing with the new character Sage. Sage is a worthy addition to the cast in terms of character (not so much in design, in my personal opinion), and the overall mystery had me intrigued. I livestreamed the whole game over the course of several sessions, and the entire time I found myself speculating in my attempts to figure out what was happening. There are a couple of major aspects (no spoilers) that I wasn't happy about, but overall, I'm very satisfied and hungry for more of this kind of writing.\\n\\nAlso, can I just say that I'm pretty sure I was the ONLY person who called Sage's story and relationship among the characters prior to the game's release? Can I brag about that? I'm going to brag about that.\\n\\nAnyway, Sega, more of this. Please. Give us more story and more fleshed out characters like this. These are the characters we deserve.\\n\\n★ Music __________________\\n\\nIt's Sonic music, it's usually the one thing you can count on to be amazing no matter the quality of the rest of the game, and this does not disappoint. There's a couple of tracks I was meh at, but overall? Excellent. I have been listening to Breaking Through It All on loop for several days and I am begging you to NOT send help.\\n\\n★ Overall __________________\\n\\nOverall, definitely give this a look, especially if you're a long-time Sonic fan or perhaps a former Sonic fan who stepped away from the franchise. It's not perfect, but it's fun. I hope that Sega will revisit and refine the concept of an open world Sonic game in the future. And, I would be 100% okay seeing Green Hill yet again if it was in an open-world style, I'm just saying.\\n\\nHoping for some good DLC!\"])],\n",

I PISSED ON THE MOON, YOU IDIOT!!! YOU HAVE 23 HOURS BEFORE THE PISS DROPLETS HIT THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ EARTH, NOW GET OUT OF MY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SIGHT BEFORE I PISS ON YOU TOO.', 'Sonic the Hedgehog. One of the greatest and most attractive characters ever thought up. He can run at sound speed, take out enemies in a flash, and best of all, he\\'s blue colored and knows how to handle the females. Speaking of females, the Sonic universe might also be classified as \"Hot Chick Heaven\" because there\\'s such a mess of very beautiful and tough women that it will make you love the franchise even more! And since Valentine\\'s Day is around the corner, I\\'ve been inspired to make a top 10 list of the most beautiful female Sonic characters. Grab yourself a snack and a glass of orange juice, and try not to reach through the screen because HERE WE GO!\\n\\n10: Try this question on for size. Who chases and hugs Sonic all the time and wields a powerful hammer? Why it\\'s Amy Rose of course! Though more of a cutie than a hottie, you can\\'t deny the fact that she\\'s still attractive. Two things that make her attractive are the fact that she wears a dress, and when have you ever seen 3 big, very smooth arcs of hair sticking out of a person\\'s forehead? I haven\\'t! So once again, Amy Rose is lovely; that is until she goes berserk and starts hitting stuff with her hammer.\\n\\nWho\\'s at number 9? It\\'s this alien plant girl from a distant planet. Cosmo, from Sonic X. She arrived on the character\\'s planet to deliver a message saying that the galaxy was under attack by a force called the Metarex. She doesn\\'t do much except tell people to stop fighting and focus on the real matter at hand. The real reason she lands at the #9 is that she becomes Miles \"Tails\" Prower\\'s sweetheart, something Tails needed for a long while.\\n\\nNumero Ocho. Cream the Rabbit\\'s mother, Vanilla. She\\'s attractive and the size of an average human mother. What really surprises me about her is that the leader of Team Chaotix, Vector the Crocodile, falls in love with her. Kinda silly, don\\'t you think? She\\'s another character that doesn\\'t do much, but in a season 3 episode of Sonic X, she helps Chris Thorndyke get into space to fight the Metarex along with Sonic and friends.\\n\\nWhat number\\'s next? Seven, of course. Wave the Swallow from Sonic Riders. People always root for the good guys, but sometimes, the bad guys steal the show. Her mechanical IQ is equal to Tails. She also happens to be the smartest member of the Babylon Rogues. I wonder why she isn\\'t the leader. Like Jet the Hawk and Storm the Albatross, her specialty is riding the air-boards called \"Extreme Gear\". With two very long and smooth feathers extending from her head to her calves and droopy eyes, Wave will rock your socks. If only we could see her take wing.\\n\\nNumero Six. Tikal the Echidna from Sonic Adventure 1. Named after an ancient Mayan city of the same name, Tikal is the daughter of Chief Pachacamac. She\\'s yet another character that hardly does a thing except beg her father to stop being so greedy. She also traps herself inside the Master Emerald so that the water god Chaos doesn\\'t reign terror upon the land. When you\\'re the daughter of a person in the highest power, you need to look your best and Tikal delivers perfectly. That\\'s why she\\'s #6\\n\\nNumber #1, #2, #3, #4, #5! Ah-Ah-Ahhh! Mina Mongoose from the Sonic Archie comics. How could you go wrong with a girl that looks like this? She can run nearly as fast as Sonic and she went from being a Freedom Fighter to being a popstar singer. Next to Princess Sally she looks more humanoid than the other characters. Who could top someone who has long mauv hair?\\n\\nThis female standing at number 4: Blaze the Cat. One word: Pyrokinesis. How would you like to have that superpower? I mean Blaze could play around in the Himalayas for hours and she would be perfectly fine! Also, 45 degree ponytail makes her look like a Native American. I really like the fact that her love interest is the telekinetic hedgehog Silver. The combination of mind-moving and fire superpowers make these two a reliable couple. But what really lands Blaze in the #4 spot is that her attitudes apparently more different from the other females.\\n\\nNext up is #3. What\\'s better than having a female with cascading quills? How about a female with cascading quills and hair? Julie-Su the Echidna, another Archie comic exclusive has that feature. She\\'s smart, knows exactly what to do as a freedom fighter, and even trained Amy once. She\\'s also the girl of Knuckles\\' dreams. Heh, lucky him. Her older self in the series Mobius: X Years Later is just downright hot! Just look at that long ponytail! Now we\\'re talkin\\'!\\n\\n1, 2, button my shoe! Princess Sally Acorn. There\\'s a lot to say about this character. She\\'s the heir to the throne, Sonic\\'s first official romance, the only character that used to not wear clothes, brave and athletic, the most humanoid character, and is like a mother to Tails. In the TV show, Sonic SatAM, one Freedom Fighter, the cowardly Antoine constantly tries to woo Sally, but doesn\\'t succeed because... he\\'s a coward! The Princess is also a semi-perfect example of an excellent love interest, although there were a couple of times when she really snapped and acted like a lunatic; in the comics, that is. But overall, Sally Acorn really stands out amongst the slew of females not just because she\\'s Sonic\\'s first official love interest, or because she\\'s the only one who didn\\'t wear clothes, but because in the comics, she grew very long hair, and married Sonic in the future, becoming the Queen.\\n\\nSo, you\\'ve seen a pyrokinetic Cat, a swallow, two gorgeous echidnas, and even a princess! Who could possibly top those kinds of females? Well, get ready folks; this is the #1 hottest Sonic the Hedgehog female character. Rouge the Bat. If anybody denies it, how dare you? This woman can fly, she\\'s as strong as Knuckles, and is a femme fatale, seducing other characters into getting what she wants. Instead of having one love interest, she has two! Knuckles, and Shadow the Hedgehog. Being a treasure thief, she\\'s only interested in one object set; jewels, especially the Chaos Emeralds. There actually have been situations where Rouge\\'s cleavage has been exposed, but it eventually got censored. What a price to pay. I think the best part about this beauty is that she wears three different outfits unlike the other female characters. And who wouldn\\'t want to fly across the landscape via strong as Shawn Johnson, and flirt with any male, anytime, anywhere. These three traits make Rouge the Bat triumph over all of the Sonic the Hedgehog females. My hat goes off to you Sonic Team USA. You oughta be proud.\\n\\nThere ya have it folks. Those were the hottest female chicks in the Sonic universe. I hope you enjoyed it, happy Valentine\\'s Day\\n\\n\\n-Guptil89', 'I\\'VE COME TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

My specs are at the very least in the minimum requirements and just nearly hit the recommended requirements, the game even ran at around 50-60 fps on high settings whenever it wasn't having a stroke trying to have Sonic run around some unreal asset island or Sonic Generations assets.

Open Area gameplay is fun and the game genuinely feels good to control. The game's biggest downfall is probably cyberspace, the movement from the open areas does not carry over to cyberspace levels and it can honestly feel really sluggish to go through. Visually this game is really nice to look at, however the pop-in can really break the immersion. It'd be nice if there were a setting to increase draw distance or something of the sort, but the graphics settings are very basic. There are no medium settings, it's only high or low. The game is also capped at 60 FPS which is a bit of a bummer since it would be nice to see a game like this run at higher refresh rates. I'd say waiting for a sale is probably the best choice. I'm sure modders can do a good job at tinkering with the game to better suit my liking.\\n\\nSide Note: The OST ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ slaps. First boss of the game literally has final boss music.\", 'It\\'s not a bad game by any means! Is it a good game though? Honestly, yeah! The islands are beautiful to explore and sort of match the character they are associated with. The story was really fun to go through as well, although, some plot points are a little off. A lot of Cyberspace was fun to go through, and the 2D platformers in the world were entertaining little spectacles to speed through. The fighting system however, was what I\\'d say was the clunkiest mechanic in the game. It\\'s not AWFUL, but it really could use some polish. But all the new moves were really cool, and while fighting is clunky, it is still super fun.\\nI\\'ll be honest though, mods can make this game significantly better such as better shading for the sweet eye candy, or animations that have more personality and polish. It makes me wonder why the devs didn\\'t think of things that modders have, but the fact they have decided to outright say they think of modders as \"rivals\" is really cool and shows that they really want to put everyone they got into satisfying us with the blue blur we all love.\\n\\nThe recent \"Final Horizon\" update really changed things up and was a lot of fun to go through. I won\\'t lie, it was INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT. But I\\'m glad that the devs gave us a challenge after everyone called the game way too easy. It was deserved on our part. Aside from gameplay though, it expands a lot on some questions we had after playing the initial game. Things are answered, and I really appreciate that. I think Sonic Frontiers is an excellent foundation to pave the way for Sonic to rid himself of the clown title he gained from Sonic Forces. If there\\'s one thing I could change about this game? Better graphics, or better mystery within the story.\\n\\nOh, and the best thing about this game is its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ MUSIC. They ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ COOKED. I love you Kellin Quinn. Oh, and you too I guess Roger. (I really prefer Jason Griffith but I believe Roger made significant improvements with this game. His performance does not go unnoticed. Wonderful work.)', \"Without a doubt the best game since generations. The open world gameplay is hands down some of the best the series has ever had but the cyberspace levels feel a little shallow compared to even some of the bonus stages in games like generations or unleashed but some of the later ones do start picking up the slack quite a bit. But since the open world is where you're at most of the time those aren't a huge concern. The story was also probably one of the most well rounded in the series being paced pretty well and even with some complaints about the ending being a bit of a fizzle I thought that it concluded nicely even if there was a bit of a quick wrap up. Overall I'd say it's just barely behind the best of modern and adventure era for me but if you want a fun game that has a lot to give this is definitely one to try out. 8.5/10\\n\\nThat was what I thought of the game prior to the story expansion update. The new update basically fixed any issues I had with the game before, platforming is way more complex and skill based, the final story has been way more fleshed out an interesting than it was previously, and they've managed to create a sort of blend of Unleashed/Generations and the first Adventure game but have taken mostly just the best parts of both gameplay loops and combined them really well. I still have to finish the end of the expansion so it might not maintain this level till the end but with a majority of it done I have to say this is what should have been here at launch to get a 10/10 for me in terms of a Sonic game. Especially if you do some modding to it to iron out a few of the issues here and there with a physics mod like Trackers Physics it might be some of the best content the series has had. Wait to go Sonic Team for absolutely blowing it away just for a free story expansion.\"])],\n",

That one time this happened or that guy appeared, cool uh?\"\\nIt\\'s a single line of dialogue at best.\\nIt definitely isn\\'t \"♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ YOU GUYS REMEMBER THIS RIGHT? IT EXISTED! ARE YOU FANS HAPPY THAT WE BROUGHT IT UP AND MENTIONED AND PRAISED IT FOR A FULL MINUTE?\"\\nIt just feels naturally and not forced.\\nbut like, if you aren\\'t a Sonic fan, you won\\'t understand ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but I believe that these references also spice up the curiosity of a Non-Sonic Fan to try out the previous installments of Sonic\\'s history and the calm and natural way they do it definitely doesn\\'t strike a bad chord with me.\\nFrontiers seeks to tie in every past Sonic game to Frontiers and letting everyone know that as much as every other game felt separate from each other, they were still part of the same timeline of events.\\nSo, if you had your doubts about Sonic Colors and Sonic Unleashed taking place in the same timeline or universe, there you go, Frontiers proves they do indeed take place in the same timeline and universe.\\nThe references also feel a lot like to \"All of our adventures built up to this game\"\\n\\nNow...\\nShould you buy it for full 60 bucks?\\nIdk, you do you, but 60 bucks is too much for a game that feels a lot like an experiment or a proof of concept for a new sonic formula.\\nI mean, I personally LOVE how Sonic Team is trying to branch out and add more and more to Sonic\\'s gameplay, but don\\'t go into this expecting a refined experience.\\nTry to get it on sale\\nAlso, if I were you, I\\'d seek to mod a lot of things I\\'ve mentioned in this review, like some combat aspects and the physics themselves, the base vanilla game has a lot of flaws that some mods were able to either completely eliminate or make more tolerable.', \"Sonic is finally back.\\n\\nAfter Sonic Mid world and the disaster that was Forces and launch colors ultimate, we finally have a good 3D Sonic game since Generations.\\nFrom the boss fights to the open world its so good, but unfortunately its not perfect.\\n\\nMAJOR SPOILER WARNING!.\\n\\nCons.\\n\\nThe game is way too easy even on the hardest difficulty, you don't even have to time the parry you can just hold the button down.\\n\\nSpending 30 minutes grinding memory tokens just to watch a 30-45 second cutscene to back to grinding more memory tokens on Kronos island.\\n\\nThe story minigames are bad with some being worse then others especially the Laser pointing one, the bridge one, and the Ares Island Koco roundup.\\n\\nThere should've been more variety with the island designs, 3/5 Islands are grassy and that could've been fixed with Ouranos Island being snow themed.\\n\\nThe pop in is bad and needs to be fixed.\\n\\nDue to Denuvo the game can sometimes hog up all of the CPU making the game freeze.\\n\\nGiganto Bug that drops your frames to 30 if you die.\\n\\nI didnt like how it cuts to a 30 FPS cutscene of Sonic throwing Wyvern against a cliff without a button prompt, while cool I still think it should've been in game without ruining the immersion by cutting to black.\\n\\n\\nSupreme,\\nHe was obviously shoehorned in with him literally being a reskin of Giganto, and the fight was almost the exact same too, any new moves the boss had were just boring too.\\n\\nThe Final boss for hard mode,\\n\\nHey you know that voice that stops you from going out of bounds and progressing too early? No? too bad.\\n\\nNext to no story importance, which is stupid because its supposed to be some sort of god.\\n\\nAnd the fight itself?. Its literally just the space invaders minigame.\\n\\nNow I know they were rushed and had to cut corners but really?, you couldn't have done any better?.\\n\\nWhew now that that's out of the way lets get to the good stuff.\\n\\nPros.\\nThe open world is so fun to explore especially when you have full rings with infinite boost.\\n\\nThe combat is so fun while a little buggy at times with some moves not wanting to register (looking at you wild rush), The over all combat works well.\\n\\nGiganto.\\nWhere do I begin, you first meet him and he demolishes you,\\nthen once you have the 6 chaos emeralds you climb up him Shadow of the Colossus style and get the 7th chaos emerald and you have this incredible boss fight, with amazing music, and the overall feeling of being really powerful.\\n\\nThis sets a standard for Super Sonic one which will hopefully will be the case in future sonic games.\\n\\nKnight.\\nClimbing up him Shadow of the Colossus style again was great. Riding on the shield back to him was really cool. The Boss theme is the best in the game. The 2nd phase with reflecting the shield back at him was awesome. And the end with Sonic parrying the sword and then picking it up and cutting him in half was something straight out of Metal Gear Rising and that's amazing.\\n\\nThe challenges to open up the map are fun.\\n\\nCyberspace.\\nWhile a little disappointing that there's only 4 level themes, trying to get S rank and complete all of the challenges was really fun, especially 1-2. The only thing I wish was changed is more then 4 level themes, the levels being a little bit longer, and better controls for the cyberspace levels.\\n\\nFishing.\\nIt was very interesting to bring Big the cat back who hasn't been a main character in the series since Sonic Heroes in 2003. The whole fishing minigame was also a huge reference to Sonic Adventure with the theme for catching the fish being a remix of the one from Sonic Adventure.\\nIts also the best way to level up your stats with fish giving anywhere from 8 tokens to 75 depending on the size, with a tire giving you 48 tokens for some reason.\\n\\nClimbing up the towers was really cool and a nice change of pace from grinding memory tokens.\\n\\nThe sound track for this game is Amazing.\\n\\nThe length is perfect.\\nThe game is 3x longer then sonic forces for just main plus extra,\\nand that's not including the upcoming DLC and the fact that they were rushed near the end of development.\\n\\nAnd finally the mod support. The mod support for the game is incredible, with people already making mods before the game even came out.\\n\\nI'm finally glad everyone realized that the awful gameplay provided to us by Ign was an early beta build of the game and not the full game.\\n\\nI still remember everyone complaining about how it looked like a Unity game and how it was gonna be terrible, and how me and my friends all knew it was beta footage and that the game was gonna be good. I'm glad the game turned out how it is, while not perfect it still is in my top 5 favorite sonic games, and my 10th favorite game of all time. 8.5/10\", \"This game overall was a blast to play!\\n\\nIt took me 22 hours to do everything, which makes sense (my internet is jank, don't judge me lol)\\n\\nThere was A LOT that I loved about this game, and there were some things I think that needed a tad more time to develop. So let's get into it!\\n\\nI think Kronos, Ares and Chaos Islands were all great. The environments were gorgeous to traverse. I found myself being lost in the ambiance of the open zones. The immersive music accompanying the open zones is the cherry on top. Boosting, performing tricks, and finding the Chaos Emeralds was more relaxing than I thought it would be!\\n\\nThe combat system is well-thought out and gave a stronger sense of what Sonic is capable of. His skills are also very fun to use. Using the Cyloop as well as doing cool finishers on enemies gave another layer to Sonic's strength and agility in battle.\\n\\nThe story itself was mysterious and kept my attention throughout. The characters in the story also went through their own arcs that I think showed them as more true to form than previous games in the series. For example, Knuckles wasn't portrayed as a dimwit in this game, and instead had a rival-esque banter with Sonic. I think Ian Flynn proved himself while being at the helm writing the story for this game. The ever-evolving story with islands shrouded in mystery never failed to keep me curious.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this may be where my compliments end in this review. There are certain aspects of the above mentioned that I think needed more fleshing out.\\n\\nCyberspace was a mixed bag for me. Exploring the islands and finding Cyberspace portals was a treat because I didn't know what I was going to get. Some levels I think were a lot of fun, and from a design standpoint, were cool callbacks from previous games. However, the repetitive themes of Green Hill, Sky Sanctuary, Chemical Plant and the City made levels blend in after a certain point. I think more variety in the themes would have been nice. Games like Sonic and Mario have common settings, but when those settings become an over saturated occurrence, that when it becomes an issue. Also, the reuse of previous stage layouts in earlier games is somewhat of a letdown. While it may hit the nostalgia button for fans, this comes across as a bit uninspired. The controls in Cyberspace left a lot to be desired. This was especially the case with the 2D stages, which I found Sonic to control very sluggishly. Also, turning and using the camera in 3D sections seemed very restricted.\\n\\nAs I said before, the first 3 open zones were well thought out. However, there are certain open zone aspects that I think needed more time, regarding all 5 islands. For starters, the 2d sections across all 5 islands feel shoehorned in. I get that the developers were trying to cater to many Sonic fans, but in a game where exploration is a fundamental part of the story, the 2D sections felt a bit forced.\\n\\nNow this is where I talk about the second half of the game, after Chaos Island, so SPOILER ALERT. You have been warned!\\n\\nI think there was a lot of build up in terms of the story in the first half that didn't pay off in the second half.\\n\\nRhea Island I found to be negligible. It served more to move the story along, but the fact that it's on another part of Kronos Island is a bit of a letdown. I wish it had been a different theme like the previous islands. The idea of Sonic being corrupted was cool in concept, but the resolution was such a cop out. I think it was a missed opportunity to have Tails, Knuckles and Amy to be playable to help Sonic.\\n\\nOuranos Island was ok. It had the nature theme like Rhea and Kronos Islands, but it just feels forgettable. Again, another theme for the island would have been cool. From a story standpoint, Sage was a cool character to get to know. I gotta say though, the final boss and the boss in Hard Mode were HIGHLY disappointing. Easily one of the worst final boss in Sonic games. All of this anticipation of fighting something grandiose to be met with unfulfilled expectations. I wish the finale of the game wasn't such a letdown, because the first two thirds of the game were wonderful.\\n\\nPROS:\\n+first 3 islands are open and diverse\\n+engaging story\\n+combat and bosses are amazing\\n+incredible music\\n+plenty of Cyberspace stages to replay for S ranks\\n+Big the Cat is back\\n\\nCONS:\\n-Cyberspace stages vary in quality\\n-4 level themes become repetitive\\n-controls and physics are awkward\\n-last 2 islands are a letdown\\n-no variety in last 2 islands\\n-story fizzles out very quickly\\n-final boss is a major disappointment\\n\\nOverall, I think the game was a wonderful experience up until the second half. I didn't hate Ouranos Island, I just felt like I saw the same thing already with Kronos Island. 4 of the islands were fun to explore. My hope for the future is that this Open Zone format is implemented in later games with more tweaks, more characters to play as who would benefit from the skill tree, and more time to figure out to include a fleshed out finale. Also, I would love for Sonic Team to take more time on a consistent aesthetic in terms of the world around Sonic and his friends. I think the game is a step in the right direction, but it is certainly not without its flaws.\\n\\nFINAL SCORE: 7.8/10\"])],\n",

              "        list([\"I was real critical of this game coming to it's launch. I even refused to buy it for full price, waiting until it went on sale to grab it. However, I think this game turned out to be worth the full price.\\n\\nIf there's one thing this game is not, it's lacking content. I was honestly surprised how many times this game seemed to surprise me. I expected the open world gimmick to get relatively stale within a handful of hours, and I expected to clear all the islands relatively quickly. But instead, although there was a lot of similar moments, there was also a major surprisingly amount of new twist and moments they throw at you. The types of obstacles they use, the types of environments you get thrown into, they don't repeat nearly as much as I thought, and I could tell they had some people really doing what they could to keep things fresh all the way through. Every time I think I've seen all an island has to offer, I find out there's an entire segment of the island, sometimes underground, sometimes in the sky, sometimes just behind a certain corner that I never looked for, there would be an entire new theme of challenges and environments I hadn't seen before. This kept me consistently engaged, wanting to see the next interesting thing they had to throw at me. Although there was a ton of those little platform challenges across the open world, no two of them were the same, and most of them made good use of the environment they were in. I think it kept surprising me enough that this game definitely deserves the full price. There's a ton of content in this game if you're willing to take your time and look for it.\\nAnd of course, the gameplay itself is very fun. Running is fast and satisfying, the cyberspace levels (although not as fast and engaging as Generations or Unleashed,) are still very fun and interesting to go through, with many making me want to replay numerous times to beat my record time, which any good sonic game should do.\\nIf you buy it for full price, you'll get your money's worth, believe me. It doesn't do as good as it may had potential to do, but it does plenty right to warrant a look into.\", \"This game is freaking awesome.\\n\\nI don't know if I would have ever paid or if I would ever recommend it at full price- but I picked this up for ~$25 USD. This game has its shortcomings which I will mention soon, but overall I would highly recommend playing this.\\n\\nIt's like if Breath of the Wild was fun. Tears of the Kingdom I got about 70 hours out of but never finished since it was too boring. This game constantly, after about 14 hours in as of writing this, KEEPS THROWING NEW MECHANICS AT ME!!!\\n\\nSome of the bad I mentioned is almost perfectly summarized in the third island you visit called Chaos Island. The biggest problem is traversal, it's confusing, the map is slow and inconsistent, fast travel via menus is annoying to obtain (needs to be grinded in fishing, and some may HATE this minigame. I absolutely love it). The traversal is made its worst here for the map not showing how to actually get anywhere, but the worst part is this map is filled with 2d sections that lock your camera and movement into 2d whenever you enter them. The issue is when going at high speeds you WILL run into these by accident, and some you simply can not escape until you've gone through ALL of it. This admittedly frustrated me quite badly while playing.\\n\\nDifficulty within the 2d stages in the game (yes, there are also full on 2d stages!) varies wildly. Some of these are so easy that I get an S rank while dying in the stage or wasting time. 1-2 on the very first world is actually a bit challenging and requires some decent time saving thoughts. I was hoping this trend would continue, and it kind of did? It seems random. You can argue that this is due to the open world nature of the game, but each world could easily get progressively difficult in these 2d stages in my opinion. Especially since they do get harder in one amazing way:\\n\\nLearned mechanics and application of said mechanics.\\n\\nThis is game design 101, and while you may say this is the bare minimum for a game to pass, we're talking about a Sonic game. Let's be honest, base game design can be a hard ask sometimes from the Sonic Team (this is mostly in jest, I promise).\\n\\nall seriousness, you are taught mechanics like dodging very early, and dashing across rings by pressing a button. Neither of these moves are entirely mandatory but can help make you go faster. So you aren't heavily punished for NOT using them, but you're instead extremely motivated to try to use them in order to optimize your game play (quick sidenote, it's not a lame Dark Souls level parry, you literally just hold a button lol, barely any timing needed). Feeling myself get better at using these mechanics in the first stage felt really cool, because I wasn't forced to use these... I was offered them and I got better because I practiced with them.\\n\\nTraveling across rings was used a lot early on to make things faster, while not being NEEDED. But... guess what? World 2 comes along and BAM, there's a couple sections that show you early on that there is a huge path of rings through a great locked camera position. This is a required area to use this ability, you must use it to progress in a handful of locations in World 2. Now, keep in mind each of these positions are shown VERY early in your pathing through a smart camera lock. But none are sudden. World 3, BAM. There are sudden ones that require quick thinking to progress.\\n\\nI can go even further explaining this. Even the most core mechanic of dashing to an enemy or object goes from very easy and simple, while doing so effectively can allow for very fast optimizations, meanwhile later on in World 2 and 3 there are plenty of required quick presses of that button.\\n\\nQuick gushing about bosses. Fighting the first boss without the 7 emeralds then fighting it later with the emeralds feels awesome. Each boss feels progressively cooler. None of them are difficult, but that's... in my opinion okay. You are super sonic in these fights, and because of that... you feel powerful.\\n\\nThere aren't enough animations for super sonic, and for some reason the game doesn't support above 60fps nor does it support ultrawide monitors. One other annoying thing is on AMD graphics the water is super buggy in fishing. Nothing game play wise is hurt by this, thankfully. These are minor gripes though for me, just mentioning them in case you feel these are deal breakers. Oh, and the story sorta sucks. The characters rock though, and it's entertaining and honestly more compelling than both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom despite my bias leaning towards Zelda 100% in gaming.\\n\\nI am again, ONLY 14 hours in and absolutely have an incredible perception of this game. For reference, I despise open world games and especially souls like games. This game is extremely friendly for beginners.\\n\\nLet's finish with the best part of every Sega title: The freaking music!\\n\\nThis OST feels like the game itself, a slightly grown up version of Sonic! Replacing the butt rock with easy-core, which for reference is essentially the butt rock equivalent of post-hardcore music. The tracks here rule. Collecting extra tracks in game is icing on this cake. I wish there were more, personally. Maybe instead make them unlockable via fishing? That would give me TONS of incentive to grind fishing. Sega, use that OST! Everyone knows Sega games are well known for their amazing soundtracks.\\n\\nEDIT: Finished the title days later. I keep all my words from above. What an incredible game!! I am doing the after story content right now and the exclusive music for Amy is also lovely.\\n\\nThanks for reading if you did. I will leave an update above this when I finish the game.\", \"i have got all the achievements on ps5 and on pc, this game is a huge stepup from the last decade of games, the last good 3d sonic game before this was gens or debatable lost world for me, theres so much that i love about this game but there quite abit of negatives like cyberspace, i like cyberspace i find it fun af to speedrun the stages using the homing dash but this doesn't make it ok for the rehash of level themes, level design and the bad control, the game starts to go down in quality in chaos island by the constant use of 2d which gets rlly annoying when you play it, spoiler warning from here onwards, riea island (idk how to spell it sorry) is a beautiful island but turns into my least fav island due to it being only a story event which is disappointing because the island would of been my fav if it was a normal island, the final island is just a bigger kronos with inflation so i like to call it inflation island (reminds me of england rn) it takes alot of collecting to get the island finished unless you do what i like to do fishing, fishing is actually kinda fun this game its just a quick qte's and easy rewards, the ending of this game yet again is disappointing, supreme being a giganto clone and being a boring fight left a sour taste in my mouth, and the final boss the end was so anti climatic, sonic not reacting to sages death did not feel like smth sonic would do i think he would of cared and checked on eggman but unfortunately we didnt get to see that, after all this ranting it makes it seem i hate the game when its quite the opposite i love this game alot i have played it 7 times now 6 times on ps5 and once so far playing the game modded, the best part of this game is definitely the first 3 titan bosses, they all have amazing songs to go with them and the fights themselves are 10/10s, the ost is rlly good too thats all i have to say on the ost go listen to it,\\ni rlly reccomend this game despite the game clearly needing more time to cook the foundations here can make the next sonic game even better, buy it on a sale\\n8/10\"])],\n",

That may be partially because of nostalgia and not \"getting with the times,\" but what I\\'ve observed is that newer sonic games lack the direction and the integrity that older games had. And no, I\\'m not talking about the genesis games, they were archaic bare-bones platformers that most people only really like because they liked it when they were kids (not that that\\'s a bad thing).\\n\\nThe adventure games, Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic 06 in a timeline where it\\'s actually good, Colors, Unleashed (sort of?).\\nThey had a charm that Forces certainly doesn\\'t, and now Sonic Frontiers is lacking in as well.\\n\\nThe characters\\' personality and voices have all been subdued, made background to the gameplay loop which would be a mistake even if the gameplay loop was good (which it arguably is not). Sacrificing the story and characters is not only pointless but has not contributed to any inalienable quality found in this game that wasn\\'t present in the games previously listed under the category of \"the good ones.\" Essentially we\\'ve been forced to adapt from good story, mid game to bad story, mid game. That\\'s not a tradeoff, it\\'s a downgrade. Sonic sounds okay, I guess? But Tails and Amy are unrecognizable, especially Amy. And her dialogue has suffered too, losing any of the spice that came with her obsessive personality, now she\\'s just one of sonic\\'s friends with no distinguishing traits of any kind (other than she\\'s the only girl, I guess?). Tails on the other hand seems to have completely reverted to Forces\\' \"point-ass-at-threat-and-cry\" mode with weak dialogue and again: no real personality trait other than being friends with Sonic. Talis is an inventor, he made the Tornado, he is both useful and interesting...but not in this game. I have not yet seen any other cameos, but I\\'d imagine they probably aren\\'t much better, as they exist nowhere in the promotional art. Eggman is here, also weakened and frankly lacking in his comically exaggerated manner. His role in the plot seems to be mostly arbitrary here, not unlike Forces and the general trend away from the formulaic Sonic vs. Eggman plotlines (which can be a good thing, it\\'s just not one here).\\n\\nThe gameplay, the thing that SONIC TEAM has supposedly mastered here, is only slightly better than forces, and is not better to an extent to excuse the black hole that is the plot and characters. Boost is back. I feel I need not say more but I will anyway. They ALMOST removed it in favor of the spin dash, but I guess that would\\'ve been to difficult. There\\'s now a maximum limit for rings in the free-roam \"\"\"open world,\"\"\" set to 400 that can be upgraded as you play. The only problem is that reaching 400 rings stored (assuming you\\'re not a complete bot) is incredibly easy and I did it in 10-15 minutes (and that\\'s after being hit a few times). Rings after this limit are pointless, completely pointless. There is no score system in the hub world, and you don\\'t gain XP for collecting rings past the limit, so ring hunting is truly useless since you will get the rings you need on your way and hit the cap for it anyway before you get the chance to upgrade.\\n\\nSERIOUSLY. It\\'s not hard. The levels already do this and they\\'re like a minute long. JUST REMOVE THE LIMIT FOR RINGS. IT IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE.\\n\\nThere\\'s also a dumbass skill tree now? So you can unlock different moves as you play, which is stupid because Sonic has always had a high skill ceiling with basic mechanics that are given to you from day 1, level 1, meaning that beginners won\\'t have to focus on unlocking moves they don\\'t know how to use, and pros can use those expert level moves immediately instead of having to artificially wait?\\n\\nThat\\'s what this game is, by the way: just a bunch of artificially waiting. Cutscenes that look less polished than gameplay, random and pointless grind rails and speed boosters to make you think you\\'re playing a sonic game, boss intros for enemies I beat in 30 seconds, time spent in menus looking for the one thing the tutorial won\\'t shut up about unlocking or changing, tutorial missions that are unskippable and require constant input for things you already know how to use demonstrably, LEARNING THINGS YOU\\'VE ALREADY BEEN TAUGHT 3 TIMES.\\n\\nHey do you know how to homing attack? It\\'s not jump anymore, silly! It\\'s X.\\nOh cool. Got it.\\nHey do you know how to homing attack?\\nYes, I\\'ve been doing it for 15 minutes now I\\'ve got-\\nIt\\'s not jump anymore, silly! It\\'s X.\\nYES I KNOW CAN YOU GET BACK TO THE GAME PLEASE?\\n...\\n...\\nHey do you know-\\n\\nIt is simply a waste of time, like how that bit was a waste of review space. Maybe some of you reading this wish I didn\\'t just take up 8 lines for that, like how I wish Sonic Frontiers didn\\'t tell me how to perform basic elementary moves 3+ times. And of course, icing on the cake, the game does not look 2022 standards for a triple-A game, the controls are confusing and arbitrarily unintuitive, and worst of all: it seems barely finished and slapped together FNAF: Security Breach style. There are plenty of terrain bugs if you go looking for them.\\n\\nI have not played through it all, and I very well might. If my opinion changes, I will update and add addendum do my review. But as it stands, Sonic Frontiers is hollow, shallow, barely fun sometimes, and generally not worthy of being added to the \"good ones\" list. Plus it\\'s 60 dollars, which is ridiculous.\\n\\n5/10. SEGA, if you\\'re reading this, finish your game, and maybe for the next one try to move away from the hollow lifeless boost model that you seem so desperate to cling to for dear life.', \"THIS IS A LOOOOOONG REVIEW. I HAVE LISTED THE GAME'S PROS AND CONS AND GIVEN AN OBJEXTIVE SCORE BELOW FOR ANYONE SKIPPING THE SENTIMENTAL HOOBLAH.\\n\\nI still remember the very first game that got me into the world of gaming. I had played exactly 2 games before that game. Transformers: the game and the TMNT 2007 Game. I played those two when i was about 8 purely because of my love for the movies. Then, one day when i was out with a buddy, they kept telling me that they need to buy a game called Sonic Heroes. When we got to a DVD store, he practically forced me to buy and experience a Sonic game for myself. And i ended up with SADX. SADX made me love Sonic. I then HAD to play Sonic Heroes. Next, I HAD to play Sonic Riders. Then i HAD to get a PS2 so i could play Zero Gravity. Before i knew it, i had not only grown to love Sonic, but gaming in general.\\n\\n14 years later, I just played Sonic Frontiers. I am the biggest fan of Sonic, but i won't defend a game blindly. Forces was awful and i literally forgot about what even happens in it weeks after i finished it. Lost World was a painful attempt to enjoy but a failure to do so ultimately because of the horrible controls. Generations was my top pick for a long time, mainly because i always enjoyed the boost gameplay. Against all odds though, i had never played SA2, and i recently picked it up and played the hell out of it. I loved it. I became a fan of both Boost and SA style of Sonic. Then the classics. I never grew up with them, and always found it difficult to like them. I even enjoyed the 2.5D sections of modern games much less than the rest. But i kept playing Mania, and then realised that the game isnt about dashing through the fastest route on the first try, but enjoying the game as a platformer which you then learn the routes to make a mad dash for the goal. I now love classic Sonic too.\\n\\nComing into Frontiers, my expectations were a roller coaster. I was extremely hyped, but was apprehensive of it given the track record as of late. Preordered it nonetheless. Saw the reviews and got dissapointed. But went into it excited as ever. What awaited me was the one of the greatest experiences i have ever had with a game. There were moments in the game which i just couldn't even comprehend were real. It's very rare that a modern game manages to capture the magic of what makes gaming so surreal and takes you right back to your childhood. This one, fortunately, absolutely succeeds.\\n\\nIt's not a perfect game. Flaws Include:\\n- Immovable camera during certain boss segments (it shows the indicator, so it's not a technical issue, it was designed that way)\\n- running on the green glowing walls is not always accurate, and can send Sonic flying\\n- dip in effort for the last island and final bosses and rapid pacing of story after 3rd island\\n- clunky menus (ironically the menu to enhance Sonic's speed is the slowest one)\\n- a bizarre boss fight near the end\\n- very few puzzles. Especially the puzzle leading to the first boss.\\n- Pop in. Noticeable, but does not affect gameplay. Did not bother me, but might bother others.\\n\\nPotential con/pro\\n-/+ open world activities and puzzles (depends on whether you enjoy the open world activities and unlocking the map then moving on to the next one and so on. I absolutely loved it, and those giving positive reviews seems to have too. For those people, this is a surreal experience. For those that dont, it will get repetitive and annoying)\\n-/+ Cyberspace levels. These are weirder this time around with a lot of variety. Mileage will vary\\n-/+ Voice acting. Was jarring for me at first, but later was loving it because it feels on point with the more serious tone of the story. Feels like the characters have matured. Amy is my personal fav, she is an incredible character in this game and each interaction with Sonic and the rest of the gang is a joy.\\n-/+ graphics. textures are not the best, but lighting is beautiful. Really gives the look of an abandoned island once populated by an ancient civilisation\\n-/+ Barren lands. Again, this one is down to personal opinion. I think it works perfectly with the story. It does not make sense to have NPCs because these are abandoned islands. There are coco, enemies and main story characters everywhere, which do a pretty good job of filling things up. Other than that, i think that the feel and ambience of the islands are exactly how they should be. Besides, it does not pose to be noticeable when you are zipping around.\\n\\nPros:\\n+ Soundtrack. Worth price of admission for this alone. Experiencing a boss unspoilt is the greatest gift anyone could ever give you. Every song with vocals somehow captures what is going through the mind of Sonic as a character in the game, Sonic as a gaming franchise, Sonic Team or any other character in that situation. We don't deserve this.\\n+ Stunning meshing of all mechanics in every Sonic game prior to this. Classic gameplay? you got it. Adventure gameplay? you got it. Boost gameplay? you got it. Warehog combos that don't suck? you absolutely got it with a pinch of DMC. Lost world style platforming that doesnt suck? you got it. 2.5D? you got it. Fishing that is actually fun, relaxing and rewarding? you got it. Riding a board? It's just one level, but that is technically a yes.\\n+ Clear mechanics. The game clearly establishes the mechanics that are available to the player, and these stick throughout bosses as well. If you have an ability, you can use it. The game also has a nice tutorial section that pops up near any encounter which let's you know what abilities can/need to be used. It is not forced, rather a button prompt - very handy. The loading screens also incorporate the tutorials, again a nice touch. There is only a single occurance of an unestablished mechanic popping up at the very end of the game in the form of a new type of QTE.\\n+ Controls are an absolute joy, and this is the best modern Sonic has controlled\\n+ Camera. They have put so much effort to making the camera great. I encountered very little problems with the camera. It is snappy and keeps up. Considering the speed of movement, it will always be difficult to have a perfect camera in an open environment for Sonic, as proven by some of the shortcomings of the adventure games. This is an extremely commendable job. They also have a static camera for segments of platforming, and this fixes into place very nicely and there is an indicator to let the player know when they cannot move the camera manually.\\n+ Story and interactions. Absolutely amazing and surprisingly intimate story/interactions. A very memorable story on par with SA2.\\n+ Moment to moment gameplay loop. With established mechanics and a great combo system, this is a joy to play.\\n+ Atmosphere and ambience.\\n+ Enemy designs. Some of the best i have seen in a Sonic game. It surprised me how they have managed to incorporate even some of the platforming mechanics into defeating specific enemies.\\n+ Future DLC. Some free DLC has already dropped for the game. There is more planned along the way, which will also be free from what has been announced.\\n\\nThis game is not perfect in the sense that not everyone will enjoy what it has to offer. That is where the reviews come in. But if you are lucky, like me, you will get one of the best experiences of your life with this game. This was literally everything i wanted in a Sonic game. The embodiment of what Sonic is and always has been - fighting through the odds and always coming out on top. That has been true for his character in a given game and as a literal real life franchise. This game contains so many references and throwbacks to real life failures as well, it is just unreal. This is an underdog story, and i am here for it.\\n\\nObjectively, this game is a 7.5/10 considering everyone's perspective and the enjoyment they will get. But experience wise for those this was made for, absolute 11/10. Welcome back, Sonic!\", 'I often dont leave game reviews, but this is a time where its very warranted. I was obsessed with Sonic when I was a kid, it was one of my favorite series and I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ loved it. However I fell off kinda hard once Black Knight came out, which, I did play and had a lot of fun with it (even though its not good) afterwards I just kinda left Sonic behind for almost 12 full year, not even playing Generations until this year. I occasionally went back to the older games for nostalgias sake. But this game was very different, it really awoke pure nostalgia in me whenever they started to put out the trailers that werent utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It made me pick up the games I ended up missing, and it took me back to a very comfortable place in my life for a bit. Then when it finally came out, it was like Christmas with Sonic Games as a kid all over again. This game came out 2 days before my birthday, and honestly it couldn\\'t have been more comforting and nostalgic to play even though with each day I feel old as ♥♥♥♥. Now unfortunately, this games not perfect, there is still a LOT of Sonic jank that seems to persist throughout the boost games and some less than stellar side content. Let me just get the bad stuff out of the way.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n1. The Cyberspace levels overall are just... kinda bland and dumb. Everyone knows at this point pretty much all of them derive from the older games, and almost none are original, and they LOOK bland because there\\'s only 4 aesthetic styles: Green Hill, Sky Sanctuary, City Escape, and Chemical Plant. Those arent inherently bad but it really gets old by the third Island. I will give credit there are some distinct CS levels that arent actually based on boost game levels, like Radical Highway, White Jungle, and Sky Rail, which as someone who loves SA2s stage design to death, was refreshing to what Sonic has been for the last 15 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ years. Also, the physics in these levels SUCK. Unless they\\'re the previously mentioned SA2 or select full 3D levels, the 2d ones suck, they suck so bad. The Physics do NOT feel right and the boost does ♥♥♥♥ all. It sucks. It honestly feels worse than Classic Sonic in Forces. The music is still pretty good as always at least.\\n2. While the overall gameplay for the Open Zones is really good, man it SUCKS that Sonic still has to rely on boost to go fast. I honestly wish they would have let Sonic run as fast as he does in the Adventure Era.\\n3. Everyone ♥♥♥♥♥ on it, everyone hates it, and I used to call it an unreasonable complaint, but man when you\\'re playing it and collecting, it becomes very apparent. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Draw Distance. I dont care about it graphically, that doesnt bother me. What DOES bother me is Ill see some collectibles just floating in free air and you wonder \"How do I get that?\" And then you look around and nothing is there because of how short the draw distance is. I get that its a lot of props coming into play but at that point why would you not just build stuff like that INTO the environment? And lets not even get into the fact by the 3rd island 80% of those rail, platform, spring, etc. sections to collect tokens FORCE you into 2D and you CANT get out of it unless you go back. It breaks the pace of trying to run from Point A to B in Open Zone. Its dumb and gets old IMMEDIATELY. STOP HAVING SO MUCH 2D ♥♥♥♥ IN BOOST GAMES.\\n4. They REALLY do not make some things in gameplay obvious. Like the parry. The dialogue box makes it feel like what you should be doing is pressing L&R bumpers when a hit is about to hit you which is an option but its really bad. What you SHOULD be doing is HOLDING L&R bumpers to parry. I did not figure this out until BEATING Boss 2 which is ALL PARRY BASED.\\n5. As far as content as a whole goes, you can beat pretty much fully complete the game in 20 hrs. Everything. Thats not a bad thing, but for an Open World Style game, there should be at least a decent amount of stuff to do on the side or after main game. Once you beat the game the only thing you get is Arcade mode which is on the main title screen and its JUST the CS levels. Not even some of the minigames from the main story, which as far as Im aware, you can\\'t go back and play them whenever you like. The minigames are kinda meh, they\\'re not bad they\\'re not great. Ones Pinball, and ones Ikaruga. In story they\\'re annoying but it would have at least been cool to have them in the Arcade Mode.\\n6. Combat while really well made, is kinda stiff when you have everything unlocked. And some are really annoying. Also they take EVERY opportunity to make sure you don\\'t get to experience Phantom Rush for more than 3 seconds. Which sucks because Phantom Rush is one of the most satisfying parts of combat.\\n7. They really hyped me up with the costumes from preorders, I thought thered be more but there\\'s 3 total... classic, SA2 Shoes, and the Adventurer Items. There\\'s one for Monster Hunter soon but... that\\'s literally it. Why even go out of their way to advertise something like that if there\\'s only 3 choices in the entire game?\\n\\nThe GOOD ♥♥♥♥:\\n1. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this is the most fun I\\'ve had for boost formula game play period. Again, while it sucks in CS, its AMAZING in Open Zone. This the first time since SA2 that I actually can feel Sonics speed. I still think SA1&2 style movement would have been better. But logically having a walking speed for doing puzzles and what not and Boost for covering ground is the right way to go. Also I found it really neat they implemented the Blue Electricity Speed from the movies. That ♥♥♥♥ dope.\\n2. The performance on PC is actually so good! I\\'m shocked. I only got 1 place in the game to chug at 1920x1440, 60fps, max settings. The only place where it suffers is cutscenes which seems to be a theme with Sonic PC ports ever since Generations. Not bad but just look grosser compared to gameplay.\\n3. The controls are rock solid everything makes sense. My only complaint is man does the right trigger get abused like crazy for boosting.\\n4. This game looks extremely pretty. I was worried it would look more Generic and only green, but, there\\'s some genuinely pretty areas and ANY area with flora is chef\\'s kiss.\\n5. The open zone maps are the perfect size. The 1st map kinda teases you with half a damn map but overall it\\'s perfect.\\n6. The Music. ESPECIALLY BOSS MUSIC. Enough said.\\n7. The Boss fights are the best in the 3D games, period. You can not change my mind.\\n8. The writing is some of the best period. The last Sonic game to actually make me feel emotions was SA2. Black Knight\\'s themes and messages were good, but is hard to take seriously because of the game itself. This however has it\\'s own rules and themes and an actually COMPETENT writer. No line in this game made me actually cringe. At worst I felt indifferent. At best I was genuinely touched with character moments and development. E S P E C I A L L Y from Tails. They did Tails some well-deserved justice. They made Amy a very likable character and not an obsessed fangirl of Sonic. They made her an actual character and even tossed the idea of \"Hm, maybe I should go my own way a bit.\" Which is a big theme in this game; finding your own path. Which ties into the gameplay therefore making an appropriate theme and not feel out of place. They also didnt make Knuckles a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ idiot again thank GOD. And even shockingly, EGGMAN has some moments where I genuinely got emotional and get to see a side of Eggman not seen since (like a broken record) SA2.\\n9. I did not run into a single major glitch in the 20 hrs I played. Not one. Well ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ done Sonic Team.\\n\\nI cant recommend this game enough if youre a Sonic fan, or not even. Its just a very good game and its the best step in the right direction since Generations. Please support this game, we need more Sonic games like it, or even ones that will evolve into better games. Thanks Sega for a great B-Day gift, please make more like this.'])],\n",

              "        list([\"A sonic game where momentum is more random than the fishing.\\n\\nI was hype for this game but upon playing it, I immediately realized that I was in for a frustrating time. To start off, for some reason the game defaults to settings that limit your momentum so attempting certain maneuvers slow you down too much or just halt you completely. You can select preset setting to emphasize either Action Style or High Speed, I chose high speed but noticed that if I hit a boost pad and let go of my stick I almost immediate come to a halt. There is also a setting that was switched on that slows you down when you jump, so attempting to jump with any type of boost slows you down so you would miss a jump and land in a canyon or a stream of lava. Another thing I notice is that the drop dash has an issue on 2D stages. It works fine on a flat surface but if there's any incline you will lose all of your momentum or stop completely. It replaces the spin dash (which is unlockable) but I assume it would have the same issue of losing momentum on anything but a flat plain.\\n\\nA couple of the enemies were fun to fight but overall most were boring at best and tedious at worst. Some of the mini bosses that were tedious to handle were the Tank, the Fortress, and the Squid. The Tank would have you watch a cutscene every time it would bring you into the air and the floating attacks that you would have to do felt like trash to land, some of my attacks would put me through the Fortress and I would fall to the floor and have to redo the entire fight, and reaching the Squid took forever even with voltage speed. Sometimes after you're done attacking some of them during their vulnerable state, you would be left so far behind that it would take an entire minute or two just to catch back up to the point where they would start attacking you again. The main bosses also fall into the boring or tedious categories. The Giganto and The End have to be the most boring boss fights in the entire game. Giganto pretty much has you spamming your attack button while The End forces you into a bullet hell in which you can't do any damage for about 2 minutes before the sequence ends. During some of the boss fights I even ran into glitches that would force me to restart the whole fight such as necessary platforms not spawning in or sonic jumping backwards on rails.\\n\\nAll of the levels that are unique to Frontiers are horrible but the stages that were blatantly ripped from previous games were pretty fun such as level 2-6 which is a reskin of Sky Rail from Sonic Adventure 2 and 1-2 which is literally just Sky Sanctuary from Sonic Generations. The unique levels had no other ways to play them and were extremely straight forward which made them boring and forgettable. There was no thought put into the maps and no exploration needed to get an S rank or to collect the Red Rings. The overworld islands were also all boring past Ares Island. Whoever designed the process of unveiling the map really needs to be fired. You will do a small challenge and the map will be exposed in small, random blotches rather than a radius around the challenge point. The towers on Rhea island had me scratching myself due to their height and awful platforming.\\n\\nA small issue I have is that this version of sonic is really boring. I don't expect him to be all quips all the time, but there are many moments where Sonic and a lot of the other characters will just stay silent or smile at one another and it's just awkward dead air. Sonic also barely says anything during gameplay, sometimes he'll chuckle or stop by some ruins and comment on it but overall he just feel like a playable character here to move the story along rather than a fun character to be around like he's supposed to be.\\n\\nThe final thing I'll talk about is the fact that you can literally use Big The Cat to cheese your way through all of your upgrades. I went to a fishing spot for about 30 minutes and spent all of my tokens on Koco Children or upgrade seeds and got my speed/coin capacity to max level and my defense/attack to around level 60 or 70. I'm glad I didn't do all the grinding for speed levels because level 99 speed is just voltage speed. So reaching max rings just gets you to level 99 speed anyways. I also purchased most of the memory tokens from Big since I couldn't be bothered to play the game any more than I had to in order to complete the story. Another thing about the fishing is that it's on a set pattern rather than random pulls. Through my 30 minutes of fishing I went through the cycle about 2 or 3 times and noticed that all of the catches would repeat in the same order.\\n\\nTL;DR the game has momentum issues, boring or tedious enemies, easy access to max out all upgrades, many glitches that will have you restart boss fights, and sonic feels off.\\n\\n\\n\\ni came back to this review multiple times to edit in things i forgot about\", 'Actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful, but it has a fishing mini-game so I am obligated to say it is good.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTL;DR it\\'s bad. Awful even, but the Sonic fanbase is in a Stockholm Syndrome love with it since it\\'s… I was going to say a not terrible Sonic game but it\\'s still pretty mediocre even by Sonic standards.\\n\\nThe movement is terrible. Sonic, even with his max ring boost, feels sluggish. He also stops on a dime the moment the controller goes into neutral even while boosting, which one could argue is for the new focus on platforming. This falls apart when you realize that the stomp has performed that function just fine in past games and would have done so here as well. Most of the time it feels like he is physically attached to the ground, god forbid you accidentally go off any ledge that isn\\'t a 90 degree angle or you\\'ll be boosting into a kill zone. Running on an open field? Don\\'t worry you are sure to just trip over a random rock and get sent flying in a random direction, usually backwards. Or hit a boost pad or spring that will send you into a on-rails section that it locks you into and proceeds to send you off in some random direction. You might think to jump to avoid these things and retain your speed, but you lose almost all momentum while in the air even while boosting. The only time the movement feels slightly wieldy is the on-rails sections where the game plays itself for you with your only input being boost, switch rails, or homing attack. Even then I found myself transfering rails while boosting to only occasionally sent flying backwards. The homing attacks lock on is flighty as well, you would think changing it to only lock on to what is on the screen would make it easier, but it still struggles when there are two or more options to hit. For some reason they made it so your boost, double jump, and most bafflingly stomp are only refreshed on the ground or certain objects, so if you double jump before homing attack an enemy hope you didn\\'t plan to do that again. Air boost into a spring? Well, I hope you don\\'t need to do that again. Want to use the Stomp for some precision landings in the line of vertical launch rings? Get ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\\n\\nNext is the combat. It is slow and overly showy. I want to blast through basic enemies at sonic speeds, not homing attack them once and go through a whole combo while using unwieldy special attacks. When I see a big ass overworld boss that I have to run up the side of to hit their weak point I want to homing attack it once, get knocked off and run up again for the other two. Not go through a whole song and dance routine for all 3 of them. I can accept it during the boss battles, but half of those boil down to waiting to use the parry, then mashing once they hit you. Oh yeah, parrying is brain dead too, it isn\\'t timing based like you\\'d think. Just hold it down and you are basically invincible for an attack before you get slow-mo and either rush in for the kill or hold it down if the game decides that\\'s not how you beat this specific enemy so you better not get any ideas. My favorite move is the homing shot, which uses boost and homing attack so better hope you don\\'t need to use the homing attack after boosting or you\\'ll find that 9 times out of 10 you\\'ll be left sitting in the air over a pit while your homing attack target dies and you no longer have a target to homing attack to.\\n\\nThe overworld and levels themselves are garbage as well. We all heard the joke \"SEGA actually hired the Nintendo-Hire-This-Man\" but it exists for a reason. Everything in the overworld looks like a basic unity asset flip with Sonic looking completely out of place. The only place this isn\\'t the case is the levels but 3 of the 4 level archetypes are just a Generations asset flip, with the sole exception being the vaguely generic looking city levels. In lore it was described that the reason the levels were like that was because they were going through Sonic\\'s memories, but I guess, like SEGA, Sonic can only remember Green Hill, Chemical Plant, and Sky Sanctuary. While only vaguely remembering what I think is supposed to be City Escape? Speaking of these levels it\\'s not only the assets that are flipped but the level design as well. If you\\'ve played past Sonic games you\\'ll probably recognize various layouts from Adventure 2, Unleashed, and most prominently Generations. They have a different coat of paint but they are still recognizable in a 15-year old making a Sonic OC from a template sort of way. Unfortunately the levels they don\\'t outright lift from other games tend to be absolutely no fun at all.\\n\\nI guess everything else is just the smaller nitpicking stuff that slowly built up to crush my enjoyment. I hated the upgrade system, at least half of it. The defense and offense fruits weren\\'t that bad, but the Korok- I mean Kocos that blend in with the gray rocky terrain and buildings are a pain to find. It is even more painful to turn the Kocos in for your speed and ring upgrades. For the fruits all you need to do is go to the guy, turn in all the fruits at once, and get all your levels all at once. The Kocos? You have to individually level up one at a time in a menu that delays itself by a second before it will let you interact with it. It took me 30+ minutes of nothing but this menu to get to max speed and the best part I still felt slow after getting all the Kocos I needed from fishing. Menuing in this game overall is terrible especially for ♥♥♥♥ you want to just do fast, like resetting levels or fast traveling. Oh hey, you unlocked and completed that level and you think that would give you a fast travel spot? What are you stupid? Complete all the poorly aped challenges/puzzles to get the whole map view and then we\\'ll unlock all the level statues as quick travel whether you ever touched them or not. Oh you\\'re clicking on the fast travel point to go there? Sorry you need to switch to the fast travel tab you idiot. I mentioned it earlier, but the puzzles all feel like poorly aped versions of Breath of the Wild puzzles copy-pasted across the map. My favorite puzzles were the night time only puzzles, where you might think \"oh maybe it will have to be night to do a puzzle related to the moon and the stars, maybe a puzzle that has to do with light and darkness\" if you were playing a good game. No, it\\'s the same glowing spots that only appear at night because SEGA wants to waste your time. \"Oh, so I\\'ll just use the pass time function that all competent games with day-night cycles have to get it done now\" you might say, but no. There is no quick time passing, so if you are left with only one \"puzzle\" left you just have to sit there for about 10 minutes afk waiting for night to fall. Special shout out to my two favorite enemies, the one that takes control of the camera to fly away leaving a balloon trail for you to go up and kill it when I just want to pass by, and the group of robot wolfs that if you get too close to will circle in a trap that you can\\'t jump out of as they one by one come out for you to slowly counter before you can leave.\\n\\nThe good things?\\n-The fishing minigame is simple but fun and it also gives you pretty much all the collectibles. You could ignore basically everything besides purple coins and the star shower event that gives you more purple coins to do more fishing and just unlock everything with Big.\\n-The interactions between Sonic and his Friends are pretty nice, a lot of nice character interactions and development that I\\'m sure will be disregarded immediately as soon as a new game comes out.\\n-Shadow the Hedgehog (the game) was made canon by a Eggman log you get from fishing.', 'I really had an expectation to at least go out of this game thinking it was a good turning point for sonic, the game peaks 3 hours in and does the exact same thing it did in those 3 hours in a worse way for the next 15.\\n\\nBoost - Boost is still an over-centralizing mechanic and the game is worse for it as much as its been said. Boost attempts to fill in the gaps of bad level design by restoring your momentum constantly but not allowing you to really feel like youre a master of the momentum system in the game, because you dont need to be, to some people this isnt a big issue but a fast paced action platformer that barely rewards your momentum is awful game design, not because boost doesnt have any positives, but because the positives of boost can be obtained with better level design. Boost is a crutch the Sonic Team has leaned on for way too long and it is definitely the case here once again. Also, the springs not resetting your air boosts feels incredibly bad in some of the levels. So many of the bosses and mini bosses are designed so that you just hold boost at them for like 30 seconds - 3 minutes, no reward for good gameplay execution when the game expects you to already be going the maximum speed 24/7. This being said I don\\'t even believe that boost is the worst part of this game, but a large contributing factor.\\n\\nOpen World - The open world felt hollow, the activities to do in the open world were easy and not very engaging at all, felt mostly like a time sink with no real depth to it. The game that comes to my mind the most in terms of such a throwaway open world design is Dragon Age: Inquisition, where so much of it is just meaningless gameplay fluff, but the awful part about this is that most of the game is this gameplay fluff, about 95% of it actually. The most unique thing Sonic: Frontiers open world did was add the Sonic The Hedgehog platforming to it, and its execution is neutered by boost and too heavily designed around it, also the inclusion of 2D sections is maddening because sometimes if you run into a boost mat(? dont remember what theyre called) or a spring it can force you into a 2d section where you are quite literally locked into it and forced to either complete this sequence (anywhere from 5 seconds to 1 minute) or break out of it by failing it to some capacity (going under a platform, missing a spring, etc). It is also worth saying that the 2D assets cannot be often targeted when in 3D as if they dont exist. Fishing with Big The Cat is a nice break but also feels like it is just sorta there to fill in the gaps for the flaws in the open world (good luck hitting 99 all stats just by being rewarded from the open world) that being said i did like the idea of it being an alternative to doing the open world content when i was getting tired of it.\\n\\nMovement - I\\'d say the movement in this game feels okay at best and extremely awful in a lot of moments, some levels feel like they punish you randomly for not knowing whats going to happen off screen for doing the things the game has been teaching you to do the entire time, randomly punishing the habbits the game has taught you with some masochistic stage design. The best i got this game to feel was when i mastered spin dashing up a slope and getting Sonic to be in the trick state which is like the only way to keep momentum for a good while in the game. Lots of animation locking which feels like it removes a lot of fun execution that could be there. The second stage (1-2) taught me so much to get that S Rank just for the rest of the stages in the game to let me get S ranks with 10-45 seconds to spare on my first attempts. The tech that stage taught me mostly just helped me not get owned as much by the jank down the line and i was thankful for that (not a jank hater Sonic Adventure 2 is my favorite, mastering jank can be fun).\\n\\nStory - Definitely cheeks and feels like an afterthought on how theyd work in the open world design into a story which is just, restoring all ur friends by doing all the tasks in the open world and gathering memory tokens. The little rock fellas are super cute though shouts out to them they kept me going. Voice acting and dialogue was pretty whatever as well.\\n\\nBoss Fights - The first Super Sonic fight was a lot of fun to me and got me very hooked! I thought to myself \"if this is just the beginning im excited to see whats next\" unfortunately the fights following were just not that great, and because I decided i loooooove fishing with Big The Cat after the first area was cleared, I was one shotting most everything and while i could say that maybe you shouldn\\'t level your power up so fast early, i feel like i would have preferred if the game stopped me cause... why wouldnt i see how far i can push the game early on for fun? Even though i was insanely overpowered early that didnt stop me from having to wait 1-3 minutes on very easy fights because they relied on making me hold boost for 3 minutes to be able to attack, some of them are okay and definitely cool to look at but didn\\'t do anything for me gameplay wise.\\n\\nStages: - Stages in this game are mostly just references to old games with about 4 different themes, some of them were okay and kinda just let you get through them, some others really just arbitrarily punished habbits the game taught you for the sake of difficulty or whatever, in general there wasnt a single stage that felt like an \"iconic\" Sonic stage to me, very lazily put together and didnt reward you very much for any sort of mastery, didnt go back to any of them after getting the 4/4 completion. I hope we get more unique stages and new things instead of what feels like referencing old sonic material over and over and over. I could die happy never seeing the Green Hill Zone map theme again in my life.\\n\\nCombat - Starts off sorta fun, very quickly you\\'re given abilities that are priority use over everything else save for a few situations, its very obvious. This wouldn\\'t be that big of a deal and you could still have some free form fun if almost every fight in the game and smaller enemies included were Mechanic > Vulnerability Phase, basically not doing the easy optimal cyclone dashes or whatever they\\'re called just means that you may be fighting some mini bosses for 5-8 minutes instead of 1-3, which after you do it the first time you definitely will not want to take it slow. The Immune Mechanic > Vulnerability phase gets tiring really easily, the parrying mechanic requires nothing out of you and the reward is very good often, you don\\'t even have to time the parry you just have to hold it until you get hit as you can sit in the parry state infinitely. All the fights in the game degrade in quality as the stats and broken cutscene moves become more relevant.\\n\\nClosing Words - This game feels like it entirely just takes inspiration from other games better than it, and tries to execute what they have but fails in almost every single way. The positive response to this game has been very shocking to me but i was sold until after about the first 3-4 hours, after which the game took a massive dive in quality and its cracks started to show immediately and only get bigger and bigger. I was just passionate about a new Sonic game and getting to have it be the first game to break in my new PC! Hoping it would turn the series around for the better, and i think because of the reception of this game we are probably doomed to having generic open world sonic games for the next few years at least, i hope not.. but that will probably be the case. I was debating writing a review on this but I feel very strongly in the opposite direction of many people and want to make sure that maybe others who feel the way I do have a review to take a peak at that validates the idea that the love for this game may just be a giant psy-op. :3\\n\\nAlso sorry for the bad grammar but if you can digest this game you can digest this review x'])],\n",

After Sonic Colors (not bad) and Sonic Generations (pretty cool, my most recent \"good\" Sonic among all the mediocre games Sonic Team did), I did not think this one would work. The idea on paper seemed amazing, but the screenshots and videos show what you get. Indeed, it is truthfully imperfect, so many things are still flawed. BUT! if you read this and you used to love Sonic since Genesis, and loved the Dreamcast experience, hear me out: Sonic Frontiers is the closest game to Sonic Adventure to date. If you want to relieve that experience, this is the one. Unfortunately, I still think they had great ideas, but not enough budget/inspiration/time/ambition, pick your answer. This game could have been an AMAZING game if the open world part had been more inspired and immersive.\\nAs it is? imagine a (fake..) open world that is just a huge Hub with mini stunts places (like, mini, between 5 seconds to 30 seconds each), all spread out throughout the map, Assassin Creed style (and all the likes) where you need to grind and activate towers to reveal the map, reveal the various icons, gather EVERYTHING on the map, etc. Make 4 maps like that, call them islands, these are the hubs where you spend 50 hours gathering everything. Now, why do I call them hub? because basically, in each of these maps, you have like ~7 portals that lead you to... the actual, typical Sonic levels. Half of them are 2D (Sonic trilogy style) while the other half is 3D (Sonic Adventure/Colors/Generations) style. But that\\'s it, they are still called 1-1, 1-2, 1-3 or 4-1, 4-2, 4-3 etc. With time trials, emeralds gathering, etc. They took out the mini-bosses from these levels and put them in the open world maps instead.\\nTalking about the enemy/character design, very uninspired - ethereal/mecha, more than robotic. And why? because this is not about Robotnik/Eggman anymore, but more about digital/cyber/SF stuff... that is a bit sad.\\nThe game is LARGELY inspired by Breath of the Wild, which is obvious seeing the impact it had in Japan (and overseas), without the clean quality of it though. You basically have to find and beat the 4 big giant bosses controlled by ancient heroes... you have little challenges here and there with weird puzzles... every few in-game days you have a red mo- sorry\\nI meant a \"shooting star night\" and all the enemies are reset... you need to find blue upgrades for your stamina bar (in circles..) and red upgrades for your hea- sorry I meant your \"speed/rings health system\"... you still have the equivalence for the little Chaos creatures called Kocos (not korok...) that you have to find by hundreds on each map... and bring them back to the \"elder\" koco... (no he does not have maracas or dance moves...)... so, yeah, the similarities are numerous like this, not plagiarism but huge inspiration for sure.\\nAll the rest is a mix of great design, and very poor choices:\\nCameras are still between awesome and a nightmare. The musics are still between awesome (remix of old themes, very 90s japan dance - imagine Sonic CD style) and awful (boss music is garbage pseudo-metal, punk, Sonic Adventure Open Your Heart style).\\nLevel design is between awesome (super hard S-rank time trials in 2D or 3D where you restart 30 times to have the perfect run) and soporific (open world map is mostly... boring).\\nGraphics and visuals are between awesome (most X-X traditional levels, 2D or 3D are REALLY cool) and plainly uninspired (open world map again, so ugly, clipping everywhere, boring textures and assets, empty world). I mean, just type \"Sonic Frontiers Levels\" to see some amazing screenshots, and \"Sonic Frontiers Chaos Island\" to see the difference with an awful environment...\\nFinally, the story? ranges from great ideas (where did the blue creature Chaos from Sonic Adventure with its weird moving heart come from? could we make Robotnik care for someone or something?) to plain boring and soporific (can not care for Sage, and usual partners Tails/Knuckles/Amy are simply useless). A weird Evangelion and cosmic mecha on top of it, and you get the idea: you will stay in this game for the rides and loops, not for the narration... even Sonic Adventure was better, that says a lot.\\n\\nBut overall? It was super cool! If I had more time I would S-rank everything (only did world 1 so far), because it is REALLY cool, and the game design, while weird and clunky at first (and all throughout) starts to make sense the more you play, and if you accept their old-school awkward design (I would bet money most of these designers are 40yo+ japanese dudes) you end up having lots of fun. Buy on sale, but DO IT if you are a Sonic fan since childhood like me!', 'The best Sonic game since Generations!\\n\\nOh boy, this one might be one of the worst first impressions ever received throughout the entire internet and I\\'m truly grateful that this game wasn\\'t reviewbombt upon release, even if there are still a lot of problems.\\n\\nstory\\nIt\\'s a platformer, so I don\\'t wanna talk too much about the story. All I can say is, that this one here might be the best story ever written in a sonic game. They tried to tell a more darker story with many serious friendship speeches and...\\nYeah, I get it, it\\'s still very edgy, but I think they did a lot better than in it\\'s predecessor, sonic forces. The new character, Sage, might have a bit of a stereotypical design but her character arc was well written imo, even sonics sidekicks since they got a bit more depth, like Amy and Tails and even Eggman (Knuckles was the same es ever tho).\\nEven Sonic wasn\\'t on a snooze cruise, I guess and didn\\'t throw in too many jokes as a comic relief which would have killed the more serious mood.\\n\\ngameplay\\nThe game is divided into 2 main parts. The open world and the Cyberspace, which are basically the classic sonic stages.\\nThe \"open zones\" are basically huge level with a lot of different platforming challenges. They are working fine enough even though it\\'s not good to look at (more about that later). It\\'s pretty satisfying being able to perform well timed jumps from high above to skip some of the challenges, but I\\'m not sure if thats intentional. They removed some shackles from the release version to make the movement customizable and more engaging, but I think they might have broken some aspects here and there and made some of these challenges trivial. But all in all, I had a lot of fun doing 100%.\\nThe cyberspace level on the other hand were very dissapointing. They are all rip offs of old level and it felt tedious to do them due to it\\'s redundance (there are only 4 skins pasted all over them). So yeah, It\\'s the weakest part of the main game for me.\\n\\nThis one has it\\'s ups and downs. Music-wise they are either complete hype or forgetabble. The best ones are no doubt the titan fights and the lyric songs in general. The open zones are average, they tried a calmer approach which doesn\\'t really suit sonic tbh. The cyberspace ones are straight up forgetabble or bad. I think they should have re-used the themes of the stages they are based on, I mean if you already copying the level design, you can do the same for the music, don\\'t you?\\nThe aesthetics are also weird. They put sonic into realistic environments with flying platforms, rails and such, which doesn\\'t align with the cartoony sonic figures. There is also very ugly pop in, which could be easily fixed if there was some kind of fade effect. I mean the main theme is the cyberspace, why aren\\'t the platforms coming in with some kind of pixelisque effect?\\nI mean it\\'s not as uncanny as sonic \\'06 but still not good to look at.\\n\\nWell, since this one was part of some free updates, I don\\'t wanna be too harsh on that, but oh boy some of these challenges are just awful to play.\\nNow we have 3 more playable characters, but they only differ slightly from sonic. But all of these new moves are either overpowered or debuffs/useless. Tails for example has some kind of move where he\\'s able to fly all over the map without any limits whereas he can skips almost all jumping challenges. Knuckles on the other hand has his iconic glide, but whenever you\\'re starting to do that, there is a long starting animation with terrible controls\\nBut even sonic has his down parts. There are some tower challenges which are straight up impossible to do them normally (on hard difficulty), because you need a very specific strategy which are difficult to come up by yourself. Some other challenges on the other hand are way too easy with more than a whole minute remaining time at the end. So yeah, it\\'s pretty unbalanced with random difficulty spikes (don\\'t wanna talk about the ridiculously insane damage the field bosses can make, since I ignored them as much as possible >_>).\\n\\nWell, this was a lot of backlash now, I know, but I can still recommend this game if you want a new sonic game. But I would suggest grabbing this on sale, because there are indeed some downer here and there, which can put you off. But most of them are part of the artistic choices, gameplay-wise it\\'s an enjoyable experience with a lot of room for improving in future entries.', \"The ProsFirst things first, the game is just fun. It’s fun to run around, make cyclops, kill enemies, collect items, grind rails, all while in an open space. Sonic works really well in an open world setting makes me wonder why Sonic Team chose to keep him in hallways for the past 2 decades. I also like the story and writing. None of the dialog feels forced and the characters have natural chemistry. The writing isn’t Twin Peaks or anything but it’s still leagues better then the writing seen in Colors, Generations, Lost World, and Forces oh especially Forces. It’s just nice seeing the characters interact. And unlike previous games the zaniness has been toned down considerably. It’s still here with Sonic making quips from time to time but it isn’t so much that it’s annoying. And I feel like this tone change is shown the best in Sonic’s voice direction. Roger Craig Smith has tweaked the Sonic voice going for a more deeper and mellow type voice. Seems like he’s trying to match Jason Griffith’s performance. Sonic has mellowed out over the years, no longer this impatient wise cracking guy. He still makes quips but it’s no longer his entire personality. I like this a lot. Sage is also a good character, she’s actually being built up and given more of a personality unlike another Sonic villain who is red and black. The platforming sections can be annoying at times but otherwise still fun since if you can do it without messing up then it’s super satisfying. The combat is also really good. It can be button mashy at times but I’ve 100% Spiderman PS4 so I don’t mind. This game really does share a lot with Spiderman PS4: the combat, skill points to get new abilities, the puzzle map system. Speaking of the puzzle map system is also fun. The puzzles aren’t anything too hard the worst they’re repetitive or they don’t really give you a clear idea on how to trigger them but still pretty fun and super rewarding when you do finally realize what to do and beat them up.I also like the music, Sonic games no matter the quality always have banger music and this game continues that trend…. At least when the music isn’t screaming at me. Listen Ik music is subjective and rock n roll isn’t that bad but who seriously finds this enjoyable?Show clip of me playing the song with my super realistic faceAnother pro is the camera. THANK GOD THE CAMERA DOESN’T SUCK. Any game can make it or break it for me if the camera controls aren't good. Super Mario 64’s camera controls give me nightmares. But Frontiers, not too shabby. And this is impressive considering how Sonic’s past camera controls usually sucked. Looking at you SA2 and Unleashed.Another pro is the boss battles. They’re more flashy over being hard but tbh I don’t mind this at all. I don’t mind when a boss can make you feel cool over a tough as nails boss and Super Sonic being included in all battles helps with making you feel super cooooool. At least as cool as you can be sitting on your couch with the laptop on your lap and holding an Xbox 360 controller. I’m so coolAnd that’s all the pros I can think of. Now onto the consThe ConsFirst thing first, while I like running around as Sonic, one problem I have is that it doesn’t feel like Sonic is equipped to run around in the world that he is placed in. He is constantly getting stuck over little things on the floor and it’s just annoying at times. Or how the collision can be a bit wonky, I’m talking full Sonic 06 at times. Another con is the momentum or lack there of itSonic fans have seemed to treat the word like it’s the plague but I feel like the lack of momentum was a huge missed opportunity on Sonic Team. Sonic basically controls like other platforms, has the normal yet slow speed and then has a run button. Yes, a Sonic game has a run button. And Ik that Lost World had it too but Lost World felt like that style warranted the button since the game was literally trying to copy Mario Galaxy. And another reason why Lost World’s use of it is better than Frontiers is the fact that Lost World’s run button doesn’t run out. The boost button being able to run out only really worked in the Boost games since that didn’t automatically fill up, u needed to do stuff like kill enemies to increase it. But here the button having a limit just makes it annoying especially since Sonic goes really slow when he isn’t using boost. And Ik that the leveling up system increases his speed but it’s still kinda lame. And the thing is that it could have worked. Sonic Speed Simulator on fricken Roblox has momentum and a leveling up system and while I agree that both systems are grindy at least Speed Simulator automatically increases u speed after each level instead of forcing you to run around and find one of the elden rocks to level yourself up.Another con is how the game flip flops between telling you exactly what to do and leaving you with nothing. In a minigame you’re told exactly what to do while in a boss battle it doesn’t even give you a hint at what to do. How was I supposed to know that I was suppose to use parry on these bombs? I don’t want the game to hold my hand the entire way through but at least idk show the bomb having a little effect which shows that you can parry them. Or maybe after dying a few times it tells you “try parrying” or something simple like that. It’s especially annoying when it tells you to go somewhere and then it has it be across an entire island forcing you to backtrack and figure out which platforming challenge in the sky you need to get to so it can take you to that island.Though these are more minor complaints, my main complaint is the cyberspace levelsNow let me say this right here, I am not a fan of the boost gamesSo maybe I’m a bit biased but my god are these just not fun. They pulled these from Forces which were pulled from Generations and there is little that was changed to accommodate Sonic's new playstyle. Try boosting, 9 times out 10 you’ll accidentally boost yourself off a platform and fall off into your death. I think a perfect example is how during the part in Sky Sanctuary where u go up a crumbling tower Sonic is no joke not fast enough to go up it in time, forcing you to boost which isn’t bad. But it is bad if god forbid you jump once or you accidently didn’t boost the exact moment you got on forcing you to fall.And because there is no momentum it makes other stages like Chemical Plant annoying to play.I don’t care that it’s nostalgia pandering, I care if it’s a good/fun stage which these aren’tAnd the worst part is that these are your main forms of getting the chaos emeralds. You need to play these and complete the mini missions to get the keys. Sometimes you’ll get one after killing a boss but most of the time these are how you’re getting them. So I literally can’t avoid thesePlus if you’re going to force me to play these at least give me more unique type levels. Not Green Hill, Chemical Plant, Sky Sanctuary, and generic Mission Street. No joke these are the only levels you’ll ever see and man they make me really hate Green HillDoesn’t help that these have fixed cameras making it harder to tell where you’re going or where you are in conciliation to the ground. WhoopieThis is also where I learned that…. the game doesn’t have brief invisibility when you get, they kinda have it in the open world part but it’s super fast so we have a Sonic 1 problem. Fun And that’s my complaints My Final ThoughtsOverall Sonic Frontiers is a good game. I feel like this game is a great blueprint of where to take Sonic in the future. While I do have some problems with this game these can and should be fixed in future entries, cut Sonic Team some slack this is their first open world game after all. And I feel like the most important thing about a game is if it’s fun to play and if it can keep you coming back. And considering how I’ve played this game for about 10+ hours as of right now over the course of a few days, yeah I think it’s doing this job correctly\"])],\n",

If you find it on sale, you may then read this review.\\n\\nThe game underdelivers at everything new it advertises, and has a few small annoying things inbetween. It's not a worthless experience though, especially if you like digging for the fun in 3D platformers. Let me elaborate.\\n\\nOpen Zones\\nThe open zones were clearly not built with sonic's movement in mind but were instead polluted with mind numbing, automated set pieces, homing attack chains, and annoying activities undeserving of being regarded as “puzzles”. That’s not to say the open zones are devoid of any fun, though, as the game is weirdly true to the series’ roots in the way that once you have a good grasp on sonic’s—thoroughly customizable—physics you will find many creative ways in which to blast through these floating platforms and make the process of collecting items much more fun. That is if you can remember where those floating platforms are before they pop in a few meters ahead of you. This game has serious pop-in issues. This is not a polished experience whatsoever. I use the HedgeModManager to deal with a lot of gameplay and presentation issues. It's incredibly easy to install. Here’s a list of the mods and codes I use that change subtle things that go a long, long way to improve the game. Like seriously. Do yourself the favor of playing with these over vanilla.\\n\\nMods:\\nTracker’s Physics\\nIsland Tweaker\\nReimagined Platforms\\n\\nCodes\\nDisable Decelerate Collision\\nReduced Homing Delay\\nHoming Attack Trick Animations\\nDisable Running Fall\\nDisable Jellyfish Camera Lock-On\\nAlways Start with Max Rings for Bosses\\n\\nThe combat encounters are as flashy as they are mindless and repetitive. There is simply not a system here. You just play a selection of cutscenes that deal damage. It sucks. The bosses are cool and filled with spectacle and kickass music but they’re super(haha) shallow in gameplay and were clearly not meant to be replayed multiple times despite what the post-game content would have you believe.\\n\\nOne of the stronger parts of the game is, ironically, its traditional stages, most of which lazily steal level designs from previous games, but do offer a relatively new and engaging experience thanks to the difference in sonic's controls. With that said, these controls are weirdly limited in comparison to their open zone counterparts, especially in the 2D stages. This is an issue that was mostly addressed with an update that let players customize sonic’s jump deceleration along with a few other properties that affect both open zone and cyberspace gameplay (The Tracker's Tweaks mod pretty much fixes cyberspace gameplay in its entirety)\\n\\nThe free Final Horizon DLC shows that the team behind the game did pay attention to fan feedback, and delivered a set of cyberspace levels that show a significant improvement in level design, offering much more open, experimental and—most impressively—platforming focused stages that allow for broader creative movement. Just don’t use the spindash to fly over all of it.\\nOh Also They Added Three Whole Ass Playable Characters For The Final Island They Are Fun I Guess.\\n\\nI like the story on paper, and the ideas and setting it presents, but the dialogue is just not good. At least it’s trying something, unlike the past decade of games, but this is not how sonic stories should be written. Holy ♥♥♥♥ does it feel like a fanfic with the way these characters talk to each other. Ian Flynn needs to dial down on the “telling” of his stories and start focusing on the “showing”. This is infinitely more apparent now that he wrote for a game instead of a comic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTLDR: The game is mostly mindless, janky and has severe presentation issues, but offers a fair amount of depth for those who want to make the best out of sonic’s movement. Don’t look at my playtime I just like messing with mods a lot. The game is roughly 20 hours long. I shouldn’t have said that. Goodbye.\", 'One of the best Sonic games, long time fan speaking here.\\nBeen through thick and thin since 2001, this game made me fall in love with the franchise again.\\nFeels like the past 10 years of whatever the hell Pontaff were on about are finally over, the OST is one of my favorites, I really appreciate the overall tone and atmosphere.\\nThe islands are all pretty well designed and movement works well.

              "        list(['Easy recommend, for multiple reasons. It has faults though. Also I don\\'t exactly shy from spoilers here but I don\\'t just reveal the whole plot either.\\n\\nLet\\'s start with the faults. The game isn\\'t exactly that clear on what you\\'re supposed to do early on, which consequentially makes the first island my least favorite. There\\'s a ton you can do almost immediately and there\\'s very little insight on what actually progresses you aside from the very obvious things you need to do.\\n\\nCyberspace is bad. Control wise at least. These are the \"regular\" Sonic stages for the game and they follow the boost formula we\\'ve had since 2008. This is definitely the worst boost Sonic has felt ever though, and that\\'s including Forces. Everything else about Cyberspace is good though, music is superb, graphics are on point, level design is mostly rehashing past design, but it\\'s rehashing design that hasn\\'t been rehashed before so I\\'m kind of okay with it. The requirements to S rank are also not too bad either, save for the very first 2.\\n\\nThe \"open zone\" is where this game shines and clearly where all the effort went. The islands are pretty big, and there are 5 of them, but they also kind of feel bland. There are multiple biomes but the first biome gets reused for the final two islands so it feels like there\\'s less to explore overall. Exploring is fun though, you really feel like Sonic or the Flash running around at such high speeds. Cyloop is also cool as a way to interact with the world and I do hope it returns.\\n\\nThis game is tied with Generations for me as my favorite though, and that is for two primary reasons. The story and the bosses. So, starting with the bosses, they are all Super Sonic fights. This seems like it would be repetitive, but honestly I lived for these fights after experiencing that first one. I could not put the game down because I wanted to play the next boss and I wanted the story to progress. These are the most hype Super Sonic fights in this franchise\\'s entire history. They have moved the bar for Super Sonic fights so much higher that I fear they won\\'t reach it again. The music, the speed of the action, the cinematics, the finishers. It\\'s all beautiful. Plus for me seeing Super Sonic actually talk to people right after is fun, since he normally doesn\\'t.\\n\\nFinally, the story. I\\'m gonna try not to spoil things, but it\\'s definitely written by a fan of the series, specifically a fan that wants the overall lore to move forward. Ian Flynn, the writer for the comics, wrote the dialogue for this game and it makes every character so much more likable than any previous game. This is my favorite story in the franchise. It also seems like they took Sonic twitter saying \"everything is canon\" literally, but it feels cohesive. They reference past games and shows a lot, which I thought wouldn\\'t feel right given how wildly the world in this franchise has changed just between each game, but it feels natural. I can believe this Sonic is the same Sonic that took down Dark Gaia or Chaos or the Deadly Six. It actually makes me angry about the writing for Generations. If we had this team writing for Generations, I feel like the lore of the series would be in an extremely different spot today.\\n\\nEither way, this game puts Sonic in a great spot and I hope Sega doesn\\'t mess it up. I do think $60 is slightly too high for it. Maybe wait for a sale or price drop, but I wouldn\\'t feel bad buying it at like $50. Like I said at the beginning, easy recommend.\\n\\nEdit: With mods this game is amazing. Recommend the \"Showin\\'s Momentum Tweaks\" mod to make the open world more fun to traverse.\\n\\nEdit 2: With the 3 major content updates this becomes an entirely different beast. This is peak Sonic the Hedgehog, and officially my favorite Sonic game of all time.', \"Gameplay\\nI have played through the first island (though not 100% yet) and so far I've had a blast all the way through. This is probably the best handling for any 3D sonic game so far. It has managed to combine the precise control of the adventure era games with the amazing sense of speed and power of the boost era games. The controls are further helped by allowing you to adjust speed and turning speed, and you can independently vary this for normal and boost running. I turned everything to max as I like twitchy gameplay and am very accustomed to SA1 and SA2 which demand a greater level of control from the player, but if that's proving difficult for you, turning down these settings can make the platforming easier. Its a great design decision that really broadens the scope for player satisfaction, and being able to do it on the fly means you can adjust to circumstances if needed as well (Turn down speed and increase turning speed if you need to do some precise platforming, or just turn everything to 11 if you want to have run around).\\nThe open world areas are brilliantly designed, rewarding exploration, full of side quests to do and with plenty of collectables. A particular highlight for me was collecting the Kocos. If you stand still for a while, all the ones in your inventory will pop up and face sonic. As you run around them they will turn to face you. The Kocos are super cute, giving me stone Chao vibes, and being able to see how many you have collected is just fun. I had a blast just seeing how many I could get on screen at once.\\nI am pleased to say that Cyberspace levels are fun as well, playing more like traditional boost era games. Sonic does feel like he is up against more resistance as he runs in these stages, but it doesn't make sonic slow, rather it makes you work for that speed (whereas in previous iterations the boost just got you to max speed immediately, its a bit more limited here. I don't prefer either (Boost era were a lot of fun for giving you super power all the way), but this works really well in this game. It should be made clear that the cyberspace levels aren't the main bulk of the gameplay like you may expect in Adventure or unleashed, with the open world areas just being hubs. They are more like bonus levels and only last a few minutes each. They are fun, feel different to the main game, and comprise maybe 10% - 15% of gameplay.\\nThe combat is also great. It adds just enough complexity to Sonics tried and tested homing attack formula, while not overcomplicating and still staying true to the feel of Sonic games from Adventure onwards. The big highlight though is the amazing boss battles. They are huge and invite you to scope them from afar to find the right approach to fighting them, whilst also affording the option to retreat if the battle isn't going well.10/10\\n\\nPresentation\\nThe game looks gorgeous. The landscapes are vast and beautifully drawn, colours are vibrant, you can see miles in the distance, reflective surfaces everywhere and everything runs smoothly. I'm playing on max settings at 4k (recoding with the AMD software at 1080p), and still seem to be getting a solid framerate. There is some detail pop in that is quite visible, but thats more or less required on a game this size and speed. It would have been nice to have a few more customisation options, even if my GPU couldn't handle it. Nevertheless, since my HW is quite old now, running at good FPS at max settings and res shows this is very well optimised. The soundtrack and sound effects are very nice as well. In combat, the sound of hitting the enemies gives a real feeling of force and adds to the enjoyment. Standard Sonic fare is here as well, with ring sounds, NPCs make cute noises in theme with the world, destroying boxes makes satisfying crashing noises, you can hear the crass rustle under sonics feet as he runs through it. Everything combines to make the world feel alive. The music is more sparse in the open zones, but what you get is wonderfully composed and helps immerse you in the experience. Sonics more rocky 3D era songs are still present as well, but only come in during cyberspace levels or boss fights, which helps in building spectacle for the player and, for me personally, improves my enjoyment.\\n\\nStory\\nThe story seems to be striking a balance, with a overall serious tone, but not devoid of cartoony elements to lighten the mood. I haven't progressed far enough to reach any conclusions, but what has been presented so far has been of a high standard. It is yet to be seen if this can beat the story in Unleashed.\\n\\nOverall: A great game, I still have to finish it, but its certainly looking like one of the best Sonic games ever released. Strongly recommended.\", \"TLDR\\nThis is a sonic game with a lot of jank but is quite good being able to run around an open world without having the stamina of an obese chronic smoker and the variety of control options is quite good the combat is very simple and easy to learn the story is quite enjoyable cyberspace stages are not the best there is a nice enemy variety the bosses are AMAZING\\nbig the cat BIG THE CAT IS REALLLLL!!!!!\\n\\nThe open world\\nThe open zone game play is really fun to run around at the speed of sound in at top speed. there is a small enemy variety unique each island the only complaints I have about it are the 2D sections and the umbrella enemies on the second island that the camera locks on to even when you are just running past them.\\n\\nThe 2D sections of the open world are very annoying especially the 3rd island I would just be running to my destination the be dragged into a 2D section and the only way out most of the time is finish the section of jump over the boosters at the start\\n\\nCyberspace stages are in my opinion the weakest part of the game all the stages were from previous games with reused assets from generations or forces with only 3 visual designs (Green Hill, Chemical Plant, and a new city style area) and since all the stages were from previous games sonic does not control well in these stages with the new game play style. The 2D cyberspace stages do not control very well at all since there is no momentum to running or boosting the second you let go of the direction you are running you just stop instantly.\\n\\nCombat in this game is very simple not much depth to the skill tree either it mostly comes down to mashing the attack button and occasionally holding down another button but some enemies require you to do the sonic new featured move The Cyloop. the cyloop is a nice addition besides using it on enemies you can also use it to collect rings and even get unlimited boost for a short amount of time.\\nThe enemies here are nice since its not just boost to kill but some are still used as homing attack fodder to get to certain platforms but overall there's not much to say.\\nMinibosss can range from really fun to just straight up avoiding it every time its on screen\\nBosses also known as Titans are extremely good in this game with each being very unique in it own way being way over the top with their presentation and designs with amazing vocal tracks to boot reminded me a little of Metal Gear Rising Revengance. The final boss of this game can only be fought on hard difficulty I highly enjoyed fighting it but some people wont since it is a very different style of game play compared to the rest of the game\\n\\nBig the Cat is back and is ready to fish. The fishing in the purple portals is just relaxing with that lofi music and a nice break from the main game. with bigs fishing you can buy stuff for upgrading stats or if you dont like some of the minibosses or cyberspace stages you can buy the portal gears and vault keys from big with enough coins from fishing. The main highlight here are the Egg memos you can purchase from big each one containing Eggmans story and character development in this game.\\n\\nThe story of this game is very simple Sonic Tails and Amy were flying around in the tornado then suddenly get dragged into cyberspace sonic escapes finds himself on the star fall islands finds Amy and runs into Sage a few times while trying to uncover the secrets to the island and collecting the chaos emeralds fight the titan of that islands rinse and repeat for the rest of the islands except the 4th island which is a more of a transitional story island. There is a lot off callbacks to previous games that any sonic can can enjoy Knuckles is back to being is normal self with his rivalry with sonic and not just the cliche dumb strong character Tails also has his character redeemed from what happened in forces Amy got some nice development Eggman and the new character Sage also have really good character development.\"])],\n",

              "        list(['He jugado básicamente todos los juegos de Sonic y puedo decir sin dudarlo que este es el mejor que hemos tenido en los últimos años (junto con Mania). La exploración es muy divertida, el control de Sonic es perfecto, las zonas del cyberspace están muy buenas sin abrumar tanto ya que son muy cortas. Ademas, la historia y personajes están muy bien desarrollados hasta donde voy.\\n\\nAlgo me dice que este juego va a ser perfecto para mods en el futuro, me imagino como los fans meterán mapas nuevos y de juegos anteriores y funcionaran increíblemente bien, ojala así sea.\\n\\nEn México por alguna razón este juego cuesta solo 750 pesos (35 usd) por ese precio no dudes en comprarlo, especialmente si eres fan de la serie.', 'Cuidado ao comprar esse jogo se você é fan de sonic!\\nEsse jogo é só mais um bait, a SEGA e Sonic Team já perderam a mão pra fazer jogos a muito tempo. Sonic morreu galera, vamos aceitar.\\n- Jogo com cenários genéricos e reaproveitados de Sonic Generations, os estágios de cyber space se repetem o tempo todo (acho que tem no máximo 4 variações).\\n- O jogo é muito repetitivo e as coisas acontecem sem razão nenhuma com 0 de logica.\\n- Os puzzles são forçados e chatos.\\n- Navegar pela ilha é um saco e você for rápido demais sonic vira um míssil se joga pra fora do mapa o tempo todo e você não tem controle nenhum.\\n- Os ângulos de câmera cagados me mataram mais do que os inimigos do jogo.\\n- Meteram um Pìnball obrigatório genérico com um score alto pra caramba (e o sonic nem é a bolinha!) chato e totalmente RNG (isso me fez quitar do jogo namoral).', 'O primeiro jogo que entrega o que eu queria de Sonic... desde Adventure 2, provavelmente. Finalmente largaram aquela babaquice infantil do Generations pra cá e fizeram o personagem ser *cool as ♥♥♥♥* de novo -- melhor pra todos, a criançada vai ter a reação de \"mãe, o Sonic é muito legal!\" de novo, e os jogadores mais velhos... também dirão \"mãe, o Sonic é muito legal\"! Em suma, o tom do jogo volta a ser o dos Adventures, que é o que eu queria desde sempre. Eu me importo muito com *tom* em videogames, então pra mim isso foi o principal destaque de Frontiers.\\n\\nClaro que eu também tenho que falar do roteiro -- o estranhamento, até pela pegada mais séria, é natural -- mas depois que eu me acostumei, tudo fluiu super bem. Na minha opinião, é o jogo de Sonic mais bem escrito até hoje, tanto em coesão narrativa quanto nas falas em si. Entendo alguns preferirem o enredo de SA2, por exemplo, mas a execução aqui é simplesmente superior.\\n\\nMas antes que a lei do Carmack venha me pegar, vamos ao que interessa: o gameplay. A primeira ilha é, para mim, a melhor coisa que joguei de Sonic desde Generations. Daí é ladeira a baixo: o core loop se desgasta relativamente rápido, acho que até mais pela forma na qual a decidir jogar (focando em abrir o mapa primeiro e fazer as coisas depois), mas até que segura surpreendentemente bem a experiência até seu fim. O que piora com força mesmo é o level design: a segunda ilha é pior que a primeira, e a terceira é bem pior que a segunda. O boss da terceira também é bem jankyzinho, então nem isso salva. Pelo menos o boss da segunda ilha é um dos melhores da franquia.\\n\\nContudo, pra mim o jogo da um bom \"pick-up\" perto do final: me diverti com a breve quarta ilha, e gostei bastante da quinta, mesmo com . Mas aí o final... hum. Narrativamente? Amei. Roteiro? Top. Estética? Arriscada, mas gostei, achei conceito. Gameplay...? Não tinha uma ideiazinha melhor não? Eu não cheguei a odiar, mas o final cria um contexto tão legal que eu simplesmente esperava ficar menos apático a ele. Uma pena.\\n\\nOs gráficos são “bonitos o suficiente”, assim como o character design novo que achei… ok! O que me incomodou foram as cutscenes: pré-renderizadas, de qualidade batatosa, e lockadas a 30FPS. Ridículo.\\n\\nA trilha sonora é *gif do cara tocando piano pegando pogo*. Simplesmente maravilhosa. Meu Deus, como senti saudades de uma boss fight aonde eu não sabia se me concentrava do gameplay ou se ficava batendo cabeça, bom demais. E a trilha é ótima em todo o seu ecletismo: a metalera é boa, o acompanhamento sinfônico temático das ilhas é bom, as músicas eletrônicas do Cyberspace são boas, e as músicas mais “tristes” definem muito bem a emoção das cenas onde são postas. Sound Team de parabéns, como de costume. Absurdo ela não estar no TGA.\\n\\nEm suma, muitas coisas podiam ser melhores, mas Sonic Frontiers é realmente um jogo muito bom, e recupera o que, para mim, é a melhor abordagem do personagem (SA, SA2), há muito adormecida. Espero que continuem nessa linha -- não de gameplay (sinceramente, pra mim, já deu por aqui, não tenho muito interesse em ver eles reiterando esse fórmula), mas de tom. A Sega **tem** que observar a ótima ressonância que o tom do jogo teve com os fãs e até com o público \"externo\" e mantê-lo. Isso é essencial, ou eles vão alienar todo mundo de novo, e talvez aí seja definitivamente.\\n\\nAgora é torcer pro Iizuka parar de baitar e meter um SA3 logo.\\n\\nÉ isto. Se você é fã da franquia, considero Frontiers um título essencial, até por essa importância de recuperação de tom. Se você não é fã, mas se interessou por algo do game, certamente será uma experiência divertida, mas espere a Sega parar de cobrar o preço de um Patek Philippe no jogo.'])],\n",

Why Denuvo?', \"Product refunded\\n\\nGreat game, had a lot of fun with on the Switch, so why is the review negative? Yeah it's Denuvo, but it's also the optimization of this port. For whatever reason with my copy of the game there are these horrible lag spikes that cause the game to stutter and freeze for 7 seconds at a time and cause my CPU usage to go up to 100%, making my whole computer unusable during it. I have tried everything I could to fix it, but to no avail, even contacted SEGA support only to get tips that I could of just googled and done in less than a day rather than almost of week of back and forward emails, Almost didn't get a refund because of how long I took trying to troubleshoot the game. My specs are at the very least in the minimum requirements and just nearly hit the recommended requirements, the game even ran at around 50-60 fps on high settings whenever it wasn't having a stroke trying to have Sonic run around some unreal asset island or Sonic Generations assets. The only thing I can think of that is causing the game to do this is bad optimization or Denuvo DRM, maybe both, who knows, I'm not a game developer and I haven't played newer PC games for a while since I didn't have the hardware to do so until now.\\n\\nOverall, I'd recommend people to be wary when buying this game and if you have the same issue I did, just refund the game, there is no fix for it and I'd doubt there's going to be patch for it given how only a handful of people seem to have gotten it, even people who have pretty beefy specs have apparently gotten the same issue, which is ridiculous because a game that looks like this shouldn't be having these kind of issues. I'll probably be staying away from any games with Denuvo DRM in them for the foreseeable future to avoid this from ever happening to me again.\\n\\nMy specs for people who care so they can laugh at me or whatever.\\nOS: Windows 11 Pro\\nProcessor: Intel Core i5-9400\\nRAM: 32 GB\\nGPU: AMD Radeon RX 580\\nSSD: PNY CS900\", 'Denuvo.'])]],\n",
