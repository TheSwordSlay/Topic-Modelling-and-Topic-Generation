HE\'S FINALLY HOME!\n\nNeedless to say that it\'s been a depressing ride as a Sonic fan for about a decade now. TL;DR: Somehow we\'re in the best possible timeline where Frontiers isn\'t just a good Sonic game, but a good game in general! We\'re in the redemption arc, both as a setting and as a video game series. It\'s not perfect, but is any game perfect?\n\nFair warning: I will save spoiler discussion for the comments section. Don\'t open that if you haven\'t finished this yet, unless you don\'t care.\n\nOPEN ZONE\n\nThe ""Open Zone"" gameplay really does manage to set itself apart from other ""open worlds"" and not just because you\'re playing as Sonic in it. Comparisons to Breath of the Wild are superficial at best - this is way more like Mario Odyssey or Metro Exodus. The only real ""Ubisoft checklist"" things here are the Side Stories, the Cyberspace levels and the map markers - everything else you have multiple methods of acquiring, and you don\'t need to get them all - only as many as the different grind walls ask you to get. In general 100% completion is very forgiving here - you don\'t even need to get all S ranks for an achievement or anything.\n\nThe best part is that this is arguably the best Sonic has ever controlled in an official game, and you can TWEAK HIM! This is almost the perfect mix of Adventure and Boost style controls - it just needs some polish for the jank. Sonic can turn so smoothly - the tank controls are almost entirely gone. The boost is heavily nerfed, no longer being a win button but more of a ""sprint"" button. The standout problem however is that whatever speed you\'ve built up will be lost when you jump. Certain terrain features and ramps will carry your momentum when you boost off them, so this seems to be either a strange design decision or bug with his jump in particular. It\'s a little frustrating, but it\'s not gamebreaking! I also think base Sonic should be a little faster than he is. We have analog sticks for a reason, Sonic Team!\n\nThe islands themselves and the strange ""random junk placed everywhere"" nature actually kind of works here. You can sequence break and approach these little obstacle courses from many angles, and while they\'re often quite automated, I found myself entering a sort of flow state where everything just clicked and I was having a ton of fun with them. I will say that the second island, Ares Island is probably the best one - Chaos Island (the third) is basically ""the 2D island"" and almost all of its obstacle courses are janky 2D sections that can be sequence broken and turned into 3D sections due to the triggers for the perspective shift sometimes being limited to a single spring. It wasn\'t horrible, but it definitely was the weakest one.\n\n\nThe Cyberspace levels actually ended up being a pleasant surprise. While the level themes are far too limited and the controls are a bit too different from the main game for my liking, I was still able to squeeze a lot of fun with some of the (limited) movement tech you can pull off to get through them as quickly as possible, and they were still better than...pretty much all of Forces\' levels. A lot of them surprisingly had alternate paths, and some sections were less automated than I expected. They definitely could\'ve been a lot better, but they weren\'t offensive nor were they the bulk of the game. The music in these is also incredible - being everything the Forces music should have been. I don\'t know what happened in the time between Forces and now, but Ohtani went ultra instinct for this entire game\'s soundtrack. Wait till you get to the damn Titan fights especially!\n\n\nCombat was also a pleasant surprise - it\'s definitely the best version of combat Sonic has ever had for sure, as it\'s generally fast, responsive and flashy. I will say that it\'s also unfortunately a bit easy, at least to someone with experience in more difficult action games or action RPGs like I have - even on Hard the ring mechanic is overly forgiving especially when you can generate more at any time with the Cyloop (this seriously should have been a cooldown or something) and parrying is way too strong given you don\'t have to time it. I think there was one point where you had to time your parry given some of the puzzles relying on it get really fast and give you a generous timer to compensate, which would\'ve been more difficult had you been required to time them. Some of your attacks take a bit too long to come out and cancelling them or speeding them up doesn\'t really...happen.\n\nIt also gets a little confusing having to remember which combination of buttons does what attack, especially when a lot of them don\'t actually do much different other than ""deal lots of damage."" I think Sonic Team should actually look at Kingdom Hearts to iterate on this system - in those games, all your melee attacks are handled by just one button (or occasionally a different one for a special move) but combo modifiers give you different, context sensitive moves that are determined by distance, elevation, whether enemies are surrounding you, etc. giving it a lot of hidden depth. The combat in those games also tends to have a lot of physicality and momentum to it, which is something Frontiers kind of has but would\'ve done better having more of.\n\n\nNow, if you\'re a lore and story nerd like I am that grew up on golden age Archie Sonic, the story and tone in this game is a dream come true! Ian Flynn has had nearly two decades of experience with this setting and these characters and oh my god does it show in this game\'s script! Characters are finally acting like characters and not caricatures, flanderization is completely gone, the writing finally knows when to take itself seriously and when to joke...it\'s like seeing the fantastic writing from the series\'s long comics history finally making it to the mainline games. Even better, this is expanding on plot threads and ideas that haven\'t been touched on since the ADVENTURE ERA! There are only two points where it disappointed in this aspect, which I\'ll get to in the comments, spoiler warning.\n\n\nFinally, the fishing is there and it\'s cute and relaxing and simple - but I heavily recommend holding off on it until postgame after building up your purple coin stock, because its economy is absolutely busted. About 15-20 minutes of fishing is enough to max out your stats in the postgame if you had been upgrading them diligently throughout the game. I was about around Lv.30-35ish in ATK, DEF and SPD when I beat the final boss, and soared up to Lv.99 after doing this. I recommend playing on Hard, not heavily grinding your ATK and DEF and ignoring your Ring stat for the most consistent challenge. I also will say - switch the game to Normal once you\'re near the end of the final island, because Hard adds an extension to the final boss that is awful in practice and doesn\'t change the ending or give an achievement. The whole game took about 20ish hours to finish, making it easily the longest and most content packed Sonic game to date ignoring stuff like the hot-dog induced nightmare that is Unleashed.\n\n\nSo, in conclusion. Sonic Frontiers is it, chief! This is one of the best 3D Sonic games we\'ve ever gotten, and might be the best written Sonic game story PERIOD as well. I originally played this through family sharing, but I was enjoying it so much that I just outright bought it so I wouldn\'t have to wait for my friend to quit his own library to keep playing. It has it\'s valleys, but this is absolutely a giant leap in the right direction and Sonic Team/SEGA need to just ITERATE on this rather than throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Key improvements right now need to be the team size (~60 people? I know ""too many cooks"" but that\'s sad for a triple A IP,) the jump physics, the combat and the Cyberspace side content, whatever form that takes in the next entry.', ""tl;dr version: It's a good Sonic game, but it's just not a good game\n\nThe Long Review\n\nGiven that this is a Sonic game and how “passionate” the fanbase is, I’m going to issue a triggering warning to any of them before continuing. This is all just my opinion and my perspective on Sonic.\n\nAfter completing this game 100%, I had some reservations whether to give this a thumbs up or thumbs down. But reluctantly, I gave it a thumbs up even though I feel like the game is only slightly above average.\n\n\nThis is probably the most important thing to talk about in my opinion in this game. Because without good controls, this game is basically dead in the water. Sonic in 3D has not controlled well and has been trash for a very long time. The last good controlling Sonic game was probably Adventure 2. I don’t even give Lost World or Unleashed passing marks. These were very average games that for some reason have been gaining more favorable impressions the more time has passed by from other people. I am not one of those people.\n\nI’m pleased to say that the controls in the is probably the best Sonic has controlled in a long time. You can adjust turn speed, boost speed, and various other things so Sonic controls fluidly in an open space. I was initially worried and skeptical when they announced the Boost mechanic for this game, because I never liked boost to begin with. In previous games, it made Sonic control extremely stiff with no change of direction and you could only move forward and back in one direction.\n\nBut in Frontiers, you can actually control quite well in the open zone, and to be perfectly honest, it really is one of the highlights of the game. Moving around in an open space with Sonic is actually pretty fun. And dare I say it, maybe it’s the most fun you can have with player movement in a . Getting top acceleration instantly and traversing through the map extremely quickly is pretty cool and unique for this genre.\n\n\nThroughout the map, there will be several points of interest for towers. When you interact with them, you’ll be able to transport to another dimension where you’ll play some short levels that are around 1 to 2 minutes long.\n\nThere’s two main problems with Cyberspace. For some reason, the controls in these levels are from the open zone. Sonic is back to controlling completely stiff. Very little acceleration. The boost mechanic tries to supplement this, but it hardly ever does. Overall, he just feels extremely slow, stiff and it’s genuinely awful.\n\nWhen you successfully do a homing attack and kill an enemy, your momentum completely stops and you can’t move forward. When you do a light speed dash on rings, your momentum also stops completely when you get the last ring. Why does your momentum have to stop all the time? When you’re trying to get through the level as fast as possible to get S rank, it just feels like a complete chore if your momentum always stops on certain things. You just have to get used to the bad controls I guess.\n\nThere are some well made Cyberspace stages, but unfortunately, I feel like I could count them on one hand and the majority of them were complete trash. Ironically enough, my favorite one is probably 1-2 which you encounter after playing for about 10 minutes. And that may only be because I loved the music in that stage and it was genuinely challenging to S rank.\n\nOverall, it feels like Cyberspace was just some hot garbage that Sonic Team decided to throw into the game at the last minute because they were worried that the fans would get too bored with the open world and needed some “traditional Sonic gameplay”.\n\n\n\nI want to state something else that may not be obvious to someone who hasn’t been keeping up with this game, but this is not really a “true” open world game like Breath of the Wild. This is an “open zone” game. Where you have 5 different small maps that you load into via load screens.\n\nThe gameplay loop is pretty simple. Go around the open zone. Collect Memory Tokens from various puzzles and rails around the map. Go to the NPC in that zone to turn in your tokens to view cutscenes and progress the story. Collect vault keys from Cyberspace levels to unlock the various Chaos Emeralds. Eventually you can fight the boss in that zone when you progress enough in the story\n\nYou repeat this three times for the first three zones. The 4th zone isn’t a real zone. It’s just some filler that they added in that only takes 20 minutes and it just shows you story cutscenes. Then, in the final zone, you do the same gameplay loop one last time and then face the final boss.\n\nI will be honest, it was pretty fun collecting the memory tokens from the first area (Kronos Island) and the second area (Ares Island). But once I got to the third area (Chaos Island), I definitely started to feel fatigue and boredom. Part of that I think is because Chaos Island is horribly designed. A lot of the memory token “puzzles” have you locked into a 2D camera where you’re unable to turn and it feels awful. Another part of it is because of the repetitive nature of the gameplay loop in general.\n\nSometimes you don’t know how to get to certain memory tokens because the graphical pop-in is so freaking terrible, you can’t see railings and platforms from a distance unless you get closer. This is a major problem with most of the zones, but I found that it was especially bad in the 3rd zone and the 5th zone. Maybe pop-in is acceptable for some underpowered crap like the Switch, but on the PC version, I am sorry, I expect better from them and there should be some higher standards here. This was actually embarrassing that they shipped this into the final product.\n\nThere is also a skill tree in this game which I almost completely forgot about. But it is so irrelevant that I don’t even know why they bothered putting this into the game. I basically maxed out my entire skill tree by the time I got halfway through the 2nd map. Huh….? I’m pretty sure they threw this in at the last minute too and had no idea how to balance the experience gain.\n\nThere also happens to be combat in this game which I think is pretty cool. There is also a Parry button, but you don’t have to time your parry at all and there isn’t any parry window or anything. You can just hold down the Parry button and it will auto-parry for you. I wish this was changed at least on the Hard difficulty. It kind of felt like a small oversight, but this wasn’t a huge deal breaker for me.\n\nOverall, the combat in this game was passable and didn’t feel like a negative at all. I hope they keep this feature for the next set of games.\n\n\nSimply put without giving any spoilers, it’s probably the best story that Sonic has had since Adventure 2. And I don’t really give a damn what anyone says. Is it as good as Adventure? No, it’s not. But it is than any of that garbage that came in the past 10-15 years\n\nYes, I prefer to have a serious story in a game about furry animals. I don’t want some boring slice of life garbage where Sonic doesn’t take anything seriously and nothing matters while he says some Marvel quips\n\nIt feels for the first time you actually get to see some small amount of character development from Eggman in particular which was really good\n\n\nIt’s a game that's worth playing if you are a Sonic fan, but is it as good as the original Sega Genesis trilogy, Sonic Mania, Sonic Adventure 1 & 2? No, it doesn’t get to that level. But I would say that it’s going in the right direction. Sega has the foundation here and they just need to keep polishing. Forget about the critics and the haters. Don’t just throw away the idea, and start re-inventing the wheel again for the next game while introducing some crappy garbage like the Werehog. Just stick to this foundation and you might produce something good later on."", ""Sonic Frontiers is a definitely a video game and its most certainly a game I have played. Now you get to witness my crappy review of this video game because I’m too obsessed with this dumb blue hedgehog. But if you don’t care to read this entire thing, I’ll just give you the tldr. I really like this game and I think it’s really fun. It’s not perfect but I think it does some nice things and I’m really excited for the future of this series.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics for this game are beautiful. Everything looks so nice and detailed along with the menus and interface looking really clean and simple to use. Do I think it’s the best-looking Sonic game? I don’t know. I still prefer the look of Sonic Unleased more and I feel that game did a better job mixing cartoon and realism while in this game the areas are much more hyper realistic. With this style I feel that Sonic looks somewhat out of place when exploring the islands. The cyberspace stages however, retain that Sonic aesthetic we are used to and they look super cool. Even though they reuse the Green Hill, Sky Sanctuary, and Chemical Plant themes they still look awesome. I do wish that they used more original themes as I am getting sick of the same stage themes being reused over and over again.\n\nSoundtrack:\nIt’s a Sonic game. They never miss with the soundtrack. Undefeatable GOATED. Nuff said.\n\nStory (Spoilers???):\nThe story for this game isn’t anything grounding breaking but for a Sonic game I thought it was good. The stories for Sonic games aren’t masterpieces in storytelling so I wasn’t expecting anything to wow me but I was hoping for something more interesting compared to what we had in previous games. I think this story delivered on that. Learning more about the Chaos Emeralds and the Ancients was really interesting and makes the overall Sonic lore more expansive and engaging. I especially like how Sega is trying to make the series lore more connected and is using this game as a staring point by referencing a lot of past events the characters went through while also trying to expand on it with the new lore and character interactions as well. They even mention characters like which now means they are canon in the mainline series. It does make me wonder if Sega will go even further and get characters from other Sonic shows and series like Sonic X. I think it would be really cool if we had a game based on the Metarex Saga from Sonic X (PLAYABLE DARK SONIC PLEASE!!!!). Who knows but it's pretty exciting to see where the story for future games will go next. The interactions between the characters in this game were also pretty good as well. I especially like the one between Sonic and Tails. I really liked seeing this as it felt like Tails is going to have the chance to become a much better character in future games and I’m honestly excited to see how he develops. I don’t think this game has the best story in the series, but I appreciate the things that it does and I feel like it’s a small step to make the Sonic universe more connected and expansive. Thank the GOAT Ian Flynn for writing this story and I hope he and others that are more knowledgeable about this series can help write and contribute to the stories of future games.\n\nAlright all that other stuff I mentioned don’t even matter. It’s time to talk about how this game actually plays. So what do I think of this game??? I think it’s pretty fun. Starting with the controls, Sonic actually controls pretty well. Sonic moves and turns quickly and smoothly. Sonic also comes with a lot of movement options as well like the homing attack, quick step, dodge, double jump, air boost, and drop dash. With all of these options it’s very easy to get where you wanna go around the world. I also love that you can also easily change the controls in the options if you don’t like them. Sonic too slow? Increase the top speed. Sonic turning way too fast? Lower the turning speed. It’s really awesome that this game gives you the option to perfect the controls to however you like to give the player the best experience (Sega really just said “Oh you think know how Sonic should play? Fine do it yourself ♥♥♥♥♥.”). But all that stuff I mentioned was for the overworld. How does Cyberspace control? It controls fine enough. Compared to something like Generations the overall gameplay for Cyberspace doesn’t feel as good but it’s not all bad either. Sonic still has more movement options in this game than in Generations so you can still have some fun moving around in these stages. I would probably compare the two games like this… In Generations Sonic controls like a racecar. Very fast but harder to control. In Frontiers he controls more like a fast bike. Slower but easier to control and do tricks with. In my opinion the gameplay in Generations feels more exhilarating but the gameplay in Frontiers isn’t a bad alternative either. Now let’s talk about the level design for the Cyberspace stages. So a lot of the levels reuse layouts featured in other games. This is honestly a bit lazy but it’s not a 1:1 translation. Only the STRONGEST of Sonic fans will truly notice but if you are a Sonic causal or newbie then you probably won’t care too much. The level designs they took are the good ones and they play great in this game too. I would still prefer if this game had its own completely original stages but I hope that Sonic Team uses this as an opportunity to learn how to design good stages for the next game. Let’s go back to the overworld and discuss a bit more about that. So in this game we have 5 islands each with a different theme. But really there are only 3 with the last two islands technically being a part of the first island. I don’t really have a problem with the last two islands but seeing the same grass theme again was pretty boring and it feels somewhat misleading to think that this game would have 5 unique islands. The last two islands are pretty much the endgame islands though so they are a bit more challenging in terms of platforming and enemies you have to fight so they are still enjoyable. Just disappointing. Each island has its own challenges and obstacles you can play with to unlock the map and get memory tokens. The challenges aren’t anything special, but some can be fun and they can be completed quickly. This game also features an actual combat system. The combat in this game is really fun. Its very simple but you still can unlock a lot of different moves to beat enemies in flashy ways so you never really get bored with it. I would love to see this combat be expanded upon in a future game. Lastly, I’ll quickly mention the boss fights. The boss fights are honestly the best part of this game are most certainly the best boss fights in the series. Super Sonic is so flashy and cool and you feel extremely powerful when fighting the bosses. It's just so hype.\n\nSonic Frontiers isn’t the best game to exist, but I do like it. I’m glad that Sega and Sonic Team have come up with a game that me and a lot of other fans are enjoying. I think if they take the time to improve on the positives of this game and expand on them while fixing some of the issues, we could have a really nice Sonic game in the future. In conclusion, Genshin Impact bad (For legal reasons this is a joke).""]"

It needs work and fixing, but I think that this time that's actually a good thing. Many things are very much not finished: the obvious pop-ins, the weird physics, Cyberspace feeling slow and sticky, the story pacing at times, the world sometimes feels a bit lackluster in versatility, the forced notifications or camera pans towards enemies and so on, but this will all help Sega going forward. They will learn and understand from these mistakes and (hopefully) grow and adapt solutions for these.\n\nLooking beyond the flaws of the game, you can feel that they genuinely tried their best to make something more worthwhile to play: first proper open world Sonic game, more intricate combat system, a story that feels like it's inspired by Unleashed and the Adventure games (thank you, Ian Flynn), characters that no longer feel flat, a kick ass OST that (most of the time) absolutely slaps HARD AF, bosses that hype you up and feel exciting to fight against, exploration that always has your attention, a world that feels like it has emotion and expression with a nice aesthetic and many more of said good details.

It's not perfect, but we're having a good 'ol time with our buddy Sonic again.\n\nI could not possibly recommend this to someone who is not a Sonic fan. Even more so, I feel like this game is not meant to be played by a larger audience than the Sonic fandom (even if they promote otherwise). It feels more like they are trying to apologize to us, the Sonic community, for their past mistakes. They want to walk away from the disaster that was Forces, and follow this new direction they took with Frontiers, and I think that's a really good thing.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, the Steam store page says 'Overwhelmingly Positive' with about 6000 reviews, and that to me is very beautiful. Since the day the first teaser dropped, everyone was scared that Sega messed up once more. 'Here comes the Sonic cycle again'. But here we are, about a week after release, and even though many of us are still conflicted and confused on what to think about Frontiers, we can all confidently say that Sega, in fact, did not mess up, and that we got a Sonic game we have all been waiting for for a very long time.\n\nIt's far from perfect, it's far from the best Sonic game, but I'm sure we can all agree that beyond it's flaws, it's a damn good Sonic game.\n\nLet's just hope Sega keeps their promise and keeps improving their quality going forward into this new decade of Sonic.""]"
4,3,88,3_and_the_cyberspace_levels,"['and', 'the', 'cyberspace', 'levels', 'is', 'are', 'for', 'of', 'it', 'but']","['-user\ntopic: Sonic Frontiers', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']","[""Let's start on the negatives, so we can leave on a good note. Every Cyber Space level are copied level design from other Sonic games. Story reason or not, I find this pretty pathetic. If I wanted to play Generations, then I'd play Generations. If I wanted to play Unleashed, then I'd play Unleashed. Hell, if I wanted to play Sonic adventure 2, then I'd play Sonic Adventure 2. This a full price retail game, this is inexcusable. It doesn't help that Sonic is designed for the open world here, and not these very linear platform heavy stages, that mind you weren't designed with his physics in mind, as they are just copied from other Sonic games. it is clunky. Sonic's jump also isn't very good. Sometimes the game will expect finer movement from you with platforming, and the jump is just not good for it at all. It serves its purpose, but it could be better. The open world is sorta just a very big hub world. Despite being open world, it really is not. The game is incredibly linear. Sure while you can technically go wherever you want, the game will constantly force you into directions that you weren't planning on going. Everything is separate from each other, there is absolutely no smooth transition. The story is sorta boring until I wanna say the 2nd island. It sorta just doesn't give you anything to hook on for the first 4 hours. One big thing that was disappointing was that the bosses did nothing but get worse. The first by far was the absolute best and most fun, after that they just get less and less cool, and the final boss I'd say is completely boring. While not inherently a flaw, I think the physics aren't a great fit either. I'd imagine most if not everyone would love to see a game where you control your speed and how fast you're able to go by mastering the terrain, and not by pressing a button to just go fast. This works in games like Unleashed and Generations, because those are most definitely what I'd call quick time event games. The game benefits from knowing when to use it, and how you want to use it. But in Frontiers, I think it's just unnecessary . This does nothing but make it feel like Generations and Unleashed, but worse. Because it doesn't add anything to the game. Also the visuals are boring, it's just the real world but you plop Sonic and some ancient tech into it. But enough of the negative. Firstly, I love this game, and it was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome. Despite everything I've said, the game manages to be fun. While I don't think it's the best gameplay, it certainly had a ton of effort and passion put into it, and I respect it. The game is fun, a lot of fun, and that's all I can really say about it. I don't exactly know why it's as much fun as it is, but it's fun. They did well with what they had. The first boss at the very least was super ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun, and hype as ♥♥♥♥. 2nd was also good, just not as hype. And for the first time since Unleashed, did the story actually feel epic. Besides the boring first few hours, I quickly became invested in it's plot. And the new character Sage is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ adorable and I love her. The music is an absolute banger too. Good lord, this ♥♥♥♥ is awesome. Never has Sonic felt more like an anime since...idk Black Knight? Anyways, the game has flaws, but damn is it a good foundation. I'm certainly happy with what we got. And I'd even say it's worth the full price. And it certainly makes me super excited for it's sequel. If they keep with this formula, I have no doubt the sequel will be a 10/10. But for now, I'd have to give Frontiers a 7/10. But it's certainly worth it. It may have issues, but I promise you will have fun. And that's my long ass review of Sonic Frontiers. Oh, and the references are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome, and a few made me ♥♥♥"", ""TLDR: Is this game perfect? No. Did I have a lot of fun with it? Yes. Would I recommend it? Yes.\n\nI was one of those people who were leery of the idea of an open-world Sonic game and not impressed by the early glimpses we'd gotten. I am pleasantly surprised by just how good and how much fun I've had with this game, but that does not mean it is perfect or free from criticism.\n\n★ Gameplay __________________\n\nThe gameplay is divided into two major categories - the open world, and the cyberspace stages, which both have a completely different feel.\n\nBy and large, the open world feels pretty good. It feels reminiscent of Unleashed, tho lacking in certain aspects of control like the drift. It also employs a combat system that took some getting used to. The idea of being able to parry in a Sonic game is still extremely foreign to me despite having finished the game.\n\nAs for the cyberspace stage gameplay, it feels more reminiscent of Forces. That is to say, extremely clunky and precision platforming is an absolute nightmare. I basically played the cyberspace levels enough to 100% them and have no intention of returning. Open-world tho? The first two islands feel SO GOOD to just run around and vibe in. This is the first time since Unleashed where I truly feel like I have a sense of what it would feel like to be in Sonic's shoes, blasting around in whatever direction my whims take me. The third island onward things get a bit frustrating with a lot of forced 2D segments that are difficult to break the camera out of. Is it a dealbreaker? Nah, but it is annoying.\n\nAs a final thing to point out, the boss fights at the end of each island are, generally, an absolute spectacle with a couple of exceptions. Also wtf to the hard mode final boss. It's not necessarily BAD but.. VERY VERY not what I expect in a Sonic game.\n\n★ Aesthetic __________________\n\nHit and miss for me. I do think the open world is gorgeous, but nothing about it feels 'Sonic' to me. I'm also not a fan of the bumpers and rails just randomly placed around the realistic looking open world. Don't get me wrong, I generally find them fun from a gameplay standpoint, but there was absolutely no attempt to integrate them into the island's aesthetic so they just look jarring and out of place. Either they should have been more integrated into the chosen aesthetic, or the overall aesthetic should have been made more Sonic-like. Preferably the former. I would love if an update was made that removed all of them so I could just run around the maps freely without looking at them.\n\nFor your more familiar checkerboards and whimsically designed robots if you happen to be missing them, you'll want the Cyberspace levels, but even then you'll just run the same three-four level aesthetics over and over again. It sadly feels very much like they cheaped out on the assets.\n\n★ Story __________________\n\nThis was the major draw for me. Sonic comic book writer Ian Flynn was chosen for the script, someone the fandom has been calling for years to work on the games. Does the story live up to expectations? Overall, hell yes. The character interactions feel genuine. They feel like actual characters with personalities and relationships and not flanderized tropes spouting one-liners.\n\nThe story focused a lot on uncovering the mystery of the Starfall Islands while also working to rescue your friends, along the way dealing with the new character Sage. Sage is a worthy addition to the cast in terms of character (not so much in design, in my personal opinion), and the overall mystery had me intrigued. I livestreamed the whole game over the course of several sessions, and the entire time I found myself speculating in my attempts to figure out what was happening. There are a couple of major aspects (no spoilers) that I wasn't happy about, but overall, I'm very satisfied and hungry for more of this kind of writing.\n\nAlso, can I just say that I'm pretty sure I was the ONLY person who called Sage's story and relationship among the characters prior to the game's release? Can I brag about that? I'm going to brag about that.\n\nAnyway, Sega, more of this. Please. Give us more story and more fleshed out characters like this. These are the characters we deserve.\n\n★ Music __________________\n\nIt's Sonic music, it's usually the one thing you can count on to be amazing no matter the quality of the rest of the game, and this does not disappoint. There's a couple of tracks I was meh at, but overall? Excellent. I have been listening to Breaking Through It All on loop for several days and I am begging you to NOT send help.\n\n★ Overall __________________\n\nOverall, definitely give this a look, especially if you're a long-time Sonic fan or perhaps a former Sonic fan who stepped away from the franchise. It's not perfect, but it's fun. I hope that Sega will revisit and refine the concept of an open world Sonic game in the future. And, I would be 100% okay seeing Green Hill yet again if it was in an open-world style, I'm just saying.\n\nHoping for some good DLC!"", 'Editing and finalising this review now that I have 100% the game in it\'s entirety (all achievements) and finished the final boss, which has an extra little secret if you beat it on hard! And holy hell this game is amazing, truly PEAK Sonic the Hedgehog for sure and I will say right now this is THE best Modern Era Sonic game to date, beats out Unleashed and Generations with ease. I\'m giving it an easy 9/10 and here\'s why;\n\nThe music is phenomenal throughout the entire game (THOSE TITAN THEMES AND FIGHTS THOUGH!!!), the aesthetics and level design is top tier, the open word although empty feeling at times excels at making the game feel big and open and it definitely gives you lots to do and collect lots to do, there\'s also loads of mini bosses to find and defeat too which adds a bit of action to all the running and jumping you\'ll be doing.\nThe Cyberspace portion of the game however starts off strong but starts to really fall apart later in the game, the 3D levels are very fun but the 2D levels feel so weird and out of place, they\'re not bad but not great, the OST for them slaps though so that\'s a plus.\n\nThe combat is REALLY solid! The skill tree for the combat is small and can be fully upgraded quickly but it opens up so many cool combos and ways to defeat enemies and bosses it honestly doesn\'t matter that there wasn\'t much to upgrade, for a Sonic game that\'s also been the first to do anything like this it was really, really good. Then to add to the combat is the addition of Super Sonic and his main story boss fights, there\'s 4 in the game where you get to use him and IT IS THE BEST THING SEGA HAS EVER DONE, no joke those Titan fights are phenomenal, the music goes HARD and the whole thing is just so cinematic and fun and again if you play on hard you end up having Super Sonic do cooler attacks against the bosses during certain points in the fight, these can be missed so don\'t try to melt them if you want to check out those, I say to play on hard because you do less damage so getting these cinematic attacks is easier.\n\nNow the story is better than any Sonic game we\'ve had for a while in my opinion and it also focuses more on Sonic for once, even though some friends do show up throughout it still feels very focused on one thing and has a lot of that focus pinned on Sonic himself and I like that... but anyway yes anyone who likes a bit of the narrative side of Sonic games will enjoy this one a lot, I enjoyed it all the way until the end, literally, and the pay off is solid, can\'t fault the story because even if it has it\'s downsides it\'s more than what\'s ever been attempted before.\nHowever one set back to beating this story and reaching the ""post game"" is that there isn\'t any, after beating the game that\'s it, no NG+ and no further unlocks afterwards, you just get sent back to before the final boss died so you can finish up on things you missed. I hope SEGA pull through and launch an update in the future with NG+ included or some kind of DLC perhaps, I don\'t know but I\'d definitely love to see more for this game!\n\nA few things I\'d like to mention as well too after I got 100% for the game though is that it\'s incredibly easy to become overpowered and very early as well, you can literally spin in circles endlessly right off the rip and gain armour and attack upgrades for free, along with rings and memory fragments to unlock story elements, then there\'s Big the Cats fishing minigame which can net you all of the above and much more just for clicking A a few times, but it is a Sonic game and is targeted towards casuals and kids so becoming strong fast was to be expected, even on Hard mode the game is easy, very difficult to die, but do play on Hard, it\'s easily the best experience you can get and has again a secret at the end!\n\nSo to round this up, yeah if you\'re a big Sonic fan or maybe even a previous one and was unsure of whether or not you should try the game, DO IT, TRY THIS GAME IT\'S REALLY FUN! You will love it trust me, it\'s the best Sonic game I think I\'ve ever played and again I really do think it beats out Generations and Unleashed, it\'s awesome, only other Sonic game that could compete with this for my number 1 spot would be Project 06, but that\'s not really official so you know what that means? Haha, I couldn\'t be more happier with the game, congratulations Sonic Team and SEGA, Sonic is back.']"
5,4,87,4_frontiers_sonic_it_is,"['frontiers', 'sonic', 'it', 'is', 'game', 'this', 'the', 'for', 'of', 'but']","['-user\ntopic: Sonic Frontiers', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']","['I grew up with Sonic Adventure DX and Sonic Adventure 2, and this game just isn\'t it. I\'ll be comparing this game with those games because others have drawn the comparison already, so I\'ll be giving my review in that context.\nIt feels a lot like someone who had only ever played Breath of the Wild was told about Sonic Adventure by someone and this was their interpretation.\nIt strikes the same sort of confusion into me as I\'d expect to get if you gave Mario a gun and tossed him into Skyrim, but also added a handful of yellow ? blocks and pipes randomly throughout the landscape.\n\nI will also add that I have only played this for an hour, as I have decided to refund it. My negative points here may be invalidated further into the game, but I found them egregious enough that I\'m just not willing to give the game the chance, and want my money back before Valve decides I enjoyed it too much.\n\nHaving played Adventure and Adventure 2 again recently, comparing those to Frontiers:\n- Frontiers soundtrack does not come close to the older games. It\'s very ""abstract"" - stages have a random cacophony that sounds like American pop-rock/emo-rock, while the overworld has a very BotW ""quiet random piano keys in the distant background"" vibe. If you like that, go for it - I find myself missing the hard rock of the older games. I guess Jun Senoue/Crush 40 weren\'t involved at all.\n- While very pretty (unsurprisingly, graphics have come a long way since ~2000), the overworld feels very empty, and is reminiscient of a windswept and bleak Scottish island I visited several years ago. It\'s been peppered with a sort of playground of random little toys, enemies and minibosses, with nothing to offer any real cohesion or context. I don\'t feel very motivated to explore any of it after the first few minutes - I think this is a combination of a few factors.\n- Levels feel very short. Again, may be an early-game thing. Sonic Adventure 2 in particular had relatively complex levels with a few different paths through them, the complexity of Frontiers levels makes me think ""mobile game"".\n\nThere are good things:\n- Controls are very good. This was a major frustration of the older games where camera angles were often fixed; this has fully embraced the dual-stick control system and feels good on a modern controller.\n- New take on abilities. In the older games, you had to find specific items in levels to unlock certain things. This lent itself to replayability (in a sense - my 9 year old self was a lot more patient than I am today), but could be frustrating, particularly when paired with the occasionally janky controls (remember trying to light dash over a line of rings and somersaulting off a cliff instead?). I find myself liking the unlockable ""tree"" abilities more.\n- Graphics are decent, as mentioned above. The general design and theme doesn\'t sit well with me, but the implementation of it is good.\n\nOverall the game feels like a confused mess trying to be Sonic Adventure game while also specifically targeting the Breath of the Wild audience. I compare with BotW a lot because I see the same ""abstract digital something plus old stone ruins"" stuff in both. Perhaps its a sign of my age that I find myself longing for a style from 20-25 years ago - this game is definitely a lot more modern, for better or worse. The soul of it is very different from what I\'m used to and expect in a Sonic game.\n\nIf you\'ve only ever played Sonic Adventure DX/2 and find yourself missing the wacky, comic-book sort of action storytelling, I\'m quite confident you won\'t find it in this game.', ""Sonic Frontiers is one of THE games ever made!\n\nOverall, I recommend buying this game, especially if you're already a starved Sonic fan, assuming you still give a ♥♥♥♥ about this series somehow. If you're not already a fan, perhaps wait for a sale. I do believe £50 is pricey when you compare this title to similar games both on and outside of Steam. Just keep your expectations in check. The high points are amazing, but man do the lows suck ass.\n\nIn a number rating, I'd just BARELY give this game a 7/10. It would be a 6 if not for the context that this is the first GOOD 3D Sonic game in over a DECADE now, and I greatly respect Sonic Team for actually having some ambition like the old days. Despite 5 years of development, it is clear they had many troubles making this after needing to scrap everything and start over. This game IS unfinished, it's obvious especially later in the game, but despite everything, I still love, and more importantly, respect what this game turned out to be in the end, again given the greater context of Sonic's game history.\n\nHere's a rough list of things I liked and didn't like from the top of my head, some points include spoilers:\n\n-- Liked --\n- The writing is some of the best in the series. Nothing groundbreaking for the writing world, but for Sonic it's a massive step up. There are various scenes in the world where he can talk with his friends in ways you'd actually believe to make sense. Crazy! I do wish more was happening during these moments outside of just standing around and talking, but it's a start.\n\n- The boss fights. With the exception of the final 2, they rule. Don't spoil yourself on them. Just play them.\n\n- I do believe the combat is serviceable, I just wished for something more involved.\n\n- The music. No ♥♥♥♥ the music is amazing, it's Sonic. Again I must point to the boss fights as those tracks go HARD. It's ridiculous but I love it.\n\n- A lot of people don't like these, but I actually liked the Cyberspace levels overall, but I would change a lot about them. I think S ranks need to be FAR harder to achieve, the red rings should actually take effort to find, and the controls should be IDENTICAL to the open world controls. For some reason, Sonic's physics are completely different in Cyberspace in all the worst ways. I understand why they are disliked, primarily for the fact they are in every way WORSE than Unleashed and Generations levels, but I still had plenty of fun with these. Still better than Forces lmao.\n\n- Fishing! :D\n\n- There's a lot of sections where you'll be playing some kind of mini-game to beat a challenge. Random world challenges do this and so do some guardian fights. Some will likely hate this but I ended up really enjoying it, with the exception of one instance seen in the dislikes list. Overall is really reminds me of Nier Automata.\n\n-- Disliked --\n- The open world level design is bland and boring. Still fun to run around in, but I'm not a fan of the massive disconnect between the world geometry and all the random rails and boosters everywhere. It just looks kinda bad and doesn't make any sense.\n- On the topic of the open worlds, Chaos Island, the third island in the game. It. Is. BAD. The game often locks you into predefined paths that are more like traditional Sonic platforming challenges. That's what those rails and springs are. But it's HORRIBLE in Chaos Island. Hard to see, or outright HIDDEN booster pads sending you in a completely different direction, locking you into a 2D section you can't escape from, and when you try to frantically get out, you hit ANOTHER one. It's not this bad for the other worlds, Chaos Island is just by far the worst in the game. The boss rules though.\n\n- Graphical issues. The game ran fine for me, but the pop in is awful. I was hoping for an option to reduce it on PC but n o p e. It very often disrupts gameplay too, as platform challenges RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU can sometimes not load in visually, so you can't see where you need to go. Remember you travel quite fast in this game too. Not a good mix as you can imagine.\n\n- Invisible walls. WHY????? Open world game locking off large chunks of the map for no reason. OK.\n\n- Ignore this point if you REALLY want to see the true final boss completely blind, but it sucks ass anyway so you shouldn't care tbh. The final boss is awful. Minor gameplay spoiler here, not story related. The gameplay of the true final boss is nothing like the rest of the game. You go from Sonic to TouHou for no reason at all. I like bullet hell shoot-em-ups, but ♥♥♥♥ this. It isn't even cool to look at. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SPHERE. Not to mention the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ monologue it goes on every time you fight it, and if you lose, back to the beginning! It's long and annoying and uninteresting as hell. Terrible way to end the game when you have so many kickass Titan fights.\n\n- This game's physics are janky as hell. I fairly often clipped through the geometry of some guardians and titans. Sonic just randomly decides whether he feels like sticking to the floor like a magnet, or just being launched into the air. The wall running sections are extremely inconsistent. Sometimes he sticks automatically, sometimes you need to hold the boost button just to run normally, sometimes the boost actually boosts and launches you off the wall, sometimes Sonic doesn't even move in the direction you input. Then there's the issue of Cyberspace having different physics entirely, so the skills learned in the world don't apply. It's just a mess.\n\n- This game has a parry move. It's lame. You hold both bumper buttons with no timing needed. It also does this annoying thing where it slows time. How is that annoying? There's a guardian fight later on that you MUST parry to beat, but when you do, you're just stuck waiting for it's next move because you can't attack it while in that phase. Repeat until it finishes it's phase. It's just lame design that feels completely untested.\n\n- You can level up Sonic's stats, but they take WAY too long. Speed and Ring levels can only be increased ONE AT A TIME using LAGGY menus. It will literally take around 30 minutes to max them out just using the UI alone. Who thought this was a good idea?\n\n- The UI in general is just laggy. You need to wait for the game to allow you to select and press a button it presents. There seems to be some arbitrary delay on these actions for some reason.\n\n- There's a big issue that comes up in the story that goes absolutely nowhere and is resolved in the exact same scene it became a problem with no real stakes at play.\n\n- There's a pinball challenge I really hated but I just hate pinball tbh.\n\n- The story cutscenes are just kinda lame. It's all just standing and talking.\n\n- I know for a fact there's more to this list but I can't think of them right now. May edit later.\n\nOverall, a good game with many issues as said at the start. Just keep your expectations in check and you'll probably have a good time. For once, I'm actually more of a glass half-full guy in this scenario. There's a lot wrong with this game, but it gets quite a lot right, and when playing I felt like the good outweighed the bad just enough."", ""NON SPOILER REVIEW!\n\nSonic Frontiers is definitely a contender for the best Sonic game ever. Having completed this on Switch and playing on Steam and Xbox currently, I've been having a lot more fun with this game than ever before. It is an amazing game that everyone should at least definitely try.\n\nWith that being said, as a non-spoiler review, the story of this game is one of the best parts of Sonic Frontiers. Yes, you heard me right. The story for Sonic Frontiers is actually on par with stories from Sonic Adventure 2 and Sonic Unleashed. Ian Flynn actually surprised me with how good the story is. The characterizations of Sage, Sonic, and Eggman are among my favorites, same with Tails. SEGA, Sonic Team, from now on, Ian Flynn is a MUST for future Sonic titles going forward. His work on IDW is among the best with writers like Evan Stanley of the mainline IDW stories and Daniel Barnes of Scrapnik Island. The ending is a bit meh though.\n\nThe gameplay is another great part of Sonic Frontiers. The controls are very smooth and responsive. And best part, you can customize it in the settings! Same doesn't go for the other versions sadly. Boost being on the right trigger, whether I like it or not, was actually a very smart decision. It works best with the camera on the right stick, because hitting X for boosting and turning with the camera just wouldn't feel all that great in my opinion. The combat for this game is actually outstanding. It may not be on par with combat systems from Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, but it's still amazing to watch Sonic pull off crazy as hell combos with the Skill Tree that is accessible from the get-go. Cyber Space is ok at best for me, but not everyone would agree with me. There are missions you do when you play Cyber Space, like collecting a certain number of rings and getting all the red star rings. The ranking system for Cyber Space is based on time. The faster your time, the better the rank will be, and honestly, this is one of my favorite ranking systems besides Sonic Adventure 2 and Sonic Unleashed.\n\nThe soundtrack is the best part of Sonic Frontiers for me. No matter which way you put it, heavy metal songs in general for Sonic the Hedgehog is a MUST from now on. The soundtrack has a more mysterious but hardcore vibe to it all, and it's even better with a vocalist such as Kellin Quinn from Sleeping with Sirens. The titan boss fights are among the best bosses Sonic has ever gotten. Long gone are the Eggman boss fights from Sonic Colors onward. The Titans are the peak of Sonic boss fights.\n\nAnd finally, one of the other greatest parts of Sonic Frontiers is the fishing minigame. I'm sorry, but Sonic Adventure's Big's Fishing levels have NOTHING on this minigame. It is actually more fun and it is a great pastime and way to get the Vault Keys besides going into Cyber Space.\n\nNow there are a few negatives for me about this game. The Cyber Space physics and controls are the worst part of the game. They are not on the same level as Open Zone, and I kinda wished it was, because you cannot fully control Sonic sometimes while playing through these linear stages. The reused assets are not really a problem for me, but Green Hill and Chemical Plant are REALLY unnecessary. Sky Sanctuary is ok, and the new city theme is very interesting. The next negative is the Elder Koco. No matter how much you bring Koco to him, you only level up your speed or ring capacity ONCE. EVERY SINGLE TIME. It is very frustrating and slow. The Hermit Koco is so much better with levelling up. The next negative is the 4th island, Rhea Island. It is so barren and empty in features in other better islands such as Kronos, Ares, Chaos, and Ouranos that it feels SO underwhelming. It is a very short island and it doesn't take long to 100% the island. One of the minor inconveniences is the buggy camera. Sometimes when you enter a certain area in an island, it'll go from a 3D axis to a 2D axis and while not bad, the camera trying to get out of the 2D axis is very annoying to deal with. One final negative is the lack of a Photo Mode, but honestly, this could be in a future patch or DLC release. Photo Mode would've been such an interesting inclusion. Just something Sonic Team should have for more Open Zone games going forward.\n\nTL;DR, Sonic Frontiers is an amazing experience. It'll vary between each person, but if you want a long Sonic game with a great atmosphere and story, with the best soundtrack and best gameplay, I HIGHLY recommend you play this game. It is an amazing game that everyone should give a try at LEAST once. If you like it, you may replay it a bunch of times. If you don't really like it, that is completely fine. Overall, Sonic Frontiers is objectively a great game. Don't let anyone else try to make fun of you for enjoying the game.""]"

Not worth the 60$ price tag or even the 40$ sale in its current state.\n\nThis was a unique sonic experience from the start to the end. I won't get too much into the story as this is mostly focused on the gameplay itself.\n\n* Movement - Clunky and Unpolished\n(Disclaimer. I played this with a mouse + keyboard so I can't tell how it feels to play with a controller)\nIn some parts of the game your movement will feel buttery smooth and amazing and in other parts it will feel like you're playing a souls-like with your feet while blindfolded, let me explain. Usually when your movement is restricted you can enter a flow-like state in parkour areas where sonic feels amazing to control and it's all around a fun experience, the problems come in when you get the constant switching between 2D and 3D or 3D restricted movement and 3D non-restricted movement. The changes happen suddenly and whenever there's not a clear sign that it's gonna occur it can lead to frustration.\n\nTurning sonic while jumping is close to impossible without dashing and if you jumped a little bit too far and want to turn around to fix it, too bad. There are 2 ways to dash in this game, with Z to follow coins or with Shift for a general dash. In some parts of the game where you feel like you should use Z dashing to follow coins it can often just lead you to parts where you suddenly fall off the edge and if you're just slightly off having the perfect angle you sometimes follow the coins in the wrong direction instead, the pathfinding needs to be worked on. Normal dashing makes you fly very very far. This is good when you wanna get to places far away, but often I found myself in situations where I thought a dash would do the trick, but it ended up being too far and I had to re-do the entire section.\n\n* Combat (Sonic) - Simple, but fun to watch\nThe game basically plays itself, most fights are usually just pressing the same buttons every encounter, but with cool animations to watch. I found myself switching my attacks often, not because I had to, but because I didn't wanna see the same cutscene play out over and over again. I thought the skill tree would be an interesting part of the game, but it got maxed out pretty quickly and there was not really any sense of accomplishment when getting a new attack. They even have an auto combo feature which I turned off in the options as I wanted some sort of action in the game. And last but not least, parrying is way too overpowered. Why do I just need to hold down two buttons to become completely immune basically every attack in the entire game from any direction and I don't even need to time the release or anything. If you're fighting something and don't know what to do, just use parry and it will probably do something favorable most of the time.\n\n* Combat (Bosses) - Chef's kiss\nI did not expect the bosses to be this good. Every overworld has a select few bosses that each have their unique way of taking them down and even though some of them are repeated, most of the time it's just fun. Squid games and Foretress are probably my favorite overworld bosses as they just look pleasing and feel great to take on. The main story bosses are a mixed bag, some parts of them are amazing while other parts just leave you confused as to what is going on.\n\n* Overworld - Aestethically pleasing with eyesores sprinkled everywhere\nThe overworld design as a base is nice and vibrant. It's not amazing, but it's pleasing to look at and fun to run around in. The ruins and otherworldly technology fits like a nice glove and is fun to explore. But then you have the eyesores. Now I know that the rails, springs, floating platforms, ziplines, treadmills and random crates have a purpose of being parkour sections, but that doesn't make them any nicer to look at. It doesn't feel like any of it was meant to be there and if you take a step back it all just looks like a jumbled mess, not to mention that they also have vertical culling applied to them, so sometimes when you're falling down after a parkour section that took you high up in the air, suddenly a rail pops up out of nowhere. Gameplay wise it's nice to use for travelling or just to have some momentarily fun parkour, but design wise it's awful.\n\n\n* Cyber Space Zones - Awful doesn't begin to describe it\nOn paper it sounds like a good idea. Classic sonic level designs where you go through a level as fast as possible and with multiple different routes to pick from, nice!\n\nNo... just no...\n\nOverall these cyber space zones gave me a massive headache, Depth perception issues, restricted to non-restricted movement, Sonic randomly stopping, turning left or right in 3D is close to impossible, dashing off the stage because it's very sensitive, Z dashing into coins don't work after jumping off from rails, some parts that look like they intended for Z dashing are actually not, dashes don't reset when jumping to enemies so often you fall down thinking you had the dash still, locked camera angles, losing all coins when you die even if you respawn at a checkpoint where you had coins before that point on the stage, some stages require close to perfection with the times while others just require you to walk towards the goal at a moderate pace and much much more...\n\n2D Cyber spaces: These are the most tame ones as they restrict your movement and a few of them are well designed and fun to play through. The parts I dislike about these are that sometimes it goes from you just cruising along to a precise platformer when you least expect it.\n\n3D Cyber spaces: Oh boy, the worst part about the game. You fall off the stage constantly, depth perception leads you to miss targets you thought you'd hit with a dash, why aren't linear parts that are clearly split into 3 sections actually split into 3 sections so you can quickly switch between them. The only way to properly control sonic in these 3D stages is to completely ruin all your momentum and make sure you perfectly line yourself up cause if you're just slightly wrong in what angle you're looking at you can fall off the stage so easily. Whenever I found a cyber space portal I prayed to all that was holy that it wasn't a 3D one, they don't work when you're running fast, there's no clear level design and if you want to experience what a 3D cyber space has in terms of potential, go play Neon White. I got frustrated to no ends with these cyber spaces and it left a sour taste every single time to the point where I hated it whenever I found a portal.\n\n\n* In conclusion: If you can stomach the price, poor movement in certain sections and cyber spaces. Go for it, this game is in its core fun to play. If you can't do that, then don't. This game feels like it's lost, it's attempting multiple different things yet masters none. It left me feeling mildly annoyed and I naively thought it would get better, but it just stayed the same throughout the whole thing. But you know what, the game has fishing and the soundtrack has some bangers. So it's not all that bad I suppose!"", 'A sonic game with a little something for all fans\n\nif you enjoy classic 2D side scrolling Sonic or the more open worldliness of modern games I believe that there is something that can catch any sonic fan\'s eyes in this entry. The progression system is interesting, the combat can be as complex as you want it to be, the open world and sub fights/levels within it are engaging and plentiful, new mechanics are fun, and overall can be tied together for an overall good Sonic game.\n\nMost of all, there are some sick ass boss fights in the game, you are super sonic multiple times, and (while we miss crush 40) the soundtrack is great. (minus the fact that when you start boosting it can sound like a Microsoft Teams chat notification that will throw you off if you are supposed to be working while playing the game).\n\nDetailed review and breakdown below:\n\n---{ Graphics }---\n☐ You forget what reality is\n☐ Beautiful\n☑ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☐ Don‘t look too long at it\n☐ MS-DOS\n\nNotes: The graphics look (in my opinion) great. As goofy as it started to feel after the first reveals that all of these rails and different platforms in the world didn\'t make sense, being in a ""cyber space"" theme it creates more possibility for creativity. It never really had that feeling of ""wow this world is created just for sonic"" because in this context, of course it has.\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n☐ Very good\n☑ Good\n☐ It\'s just gameplay\n☐ Mehh\n☐ Watch paint dry instead\n☐ Just don\'t\n\nNotes: The game itself controls well and the way that it handles the open world platforming is very interesting as it locks you into certain camera angles once you do something to trigger it. Sometimes that ""something"" can be hitting a spring or a dash pad that throws you into a small platforming section of the world.\n\nHowever, it can get annoying if you didn\'t intentionally do this and were trying to traverse somewhere else as you either have to find a way to break out of the camera lock to go lets say east/west when you are locked in directionally going north/south. It can also be frustrating in the non open more classic sonic levels where you are running because it can cause sonic to feel floaty and harder to control especially if you are in a section of the level where the camera angle changes or there are other moving parts. A lot of the time you can excuse this when playing because its easy to identify, but when you are tasked with collecting things within these levels it can make simple jump and collects pretty annoying.\n\n---{ Audio }---\n☑ Eargasm\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ I\'m now deaf\n\nNotes: The music is so sick. Metal Gear Rising levels of sick during boss fights.\n\n---{ Audience }---\n☑ Kids\n☑ Teens\n☑ Adults\n☐ Grandma\n\nNotes: Sonic fans of all ages can enjoy this title. I do think however that those who are into the sonic adventure 1/2 games will enjoy this especially. However, there are a decent amount of classic sonic side scrolling feeling levels to scratch that itch and can provide serious challenge when it comes to beating times.\n\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n☐ Check if you can run paint\n☑ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n☐ Just press \'W\'\n☑ Easy\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Significant brain usage\n☐ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n\nThere was never a time in the game where I found myself having to really ""grind out"" different levels of collectables. The general pace goes like this:\n\nOpen world sonic spawns> collect the characters memory tokens via open world platforming and white glowing signs> fight open world mini boss monsters for cogs> use cogs to unlock levels> levels (depending on what challenges you complete) award keys> keys unlock chaos emeralds.\n\nDuring this time you will do most of your hunting for the memory tokens. I never found any real issues fighting mini bosses or gaining keys from the levels. I do wish however that it was easier to find the classic sonic levels in the open world as there were some that I did miss meaning that you don\'t have to complete all of the sonic levels to complete the game. This to me kind of was lackluster as there were a few different really cool levels I missed out on during my first playthrough that I didn\'t know about.\n\n---{ Grind }---\n☐ Nothing to grind\n☑ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isn\'t necessary to progress\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ Too much grind\n☐ You\'ll need a second life for grinding\n\nNotes: as noted before the only real ""grind"" you will be doing is for those memory tokens. Unlocking abilities on the tree is very easy and there are multiple ways to do it and I never had issues being locked out of other content in the game.\n\n---{ Story }---\n☐ No Story\n☐ Some lore\n☑ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ It\'ll replace your life\n\nNotes: Its your average sonic game story. There is a little heart string tug in there but either you care about it or you don\'t. I dont think anyone is going into a sonic game thinking its going to win an emmy or anything, but there is enough there to keep you interested but not important enough that if you just want to skip some of it that you wont miss much.\n\nI will say though the new voice actors definitely take getting used to. I liked the SA/SA2 voice acting much better.\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee\n☑ Short\n☐ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n☐ It\'s free!\n☐ Worth the price\n☑ If it\'s on sale\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☐ You could also just burn your money\n\nSonic games always drop pretty heavy in price (this in some cases has already been found around 40 bucks). Definitely worth it around 30-40 in my opinion but if there are other games out right now you would rather prioritize, I dont think it will take long for you to get a good deal on this.\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n☐ Never heard of\n☑ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\n☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\nIts sonic\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n☐ 1\n☐ 2\n☐ 3\n☐ 4\n☐ 5\n☐ 6\n☐ 7\n☑ 8\n☐ 9\n☐ 10\n\nOverall, this was an awesome return for sonic and I can\'t wait to see what else is in store from the team. It seems like the people making this game are the exact people who should be.', 'This game is stupid fun, and the best sonic has felt in years. I really wanted this game to succeed, and i was really glad to get my hands on it when it first released. (I initially got the switch version, but since getting a steam deck i got the game on steam too and have been enjoying higher graphics and framerate). Sonic feels awesome, the characters havent felt this alive in a long time, and the overall direction of this game has me really excited.\n\nNow, this game is not perfect. Far from it. The general consensus is that this game is a 7/10, and for sonic that is a miracle in the modern day. However this is the most ambitious, fun, and high-inducing 7/10 i\'ve played.\n\nThe movemement in the open zone is really awesome, sonic turns very easily and while boosting you move at a fast pace. You can get a great flow going, moving from obstacle to obstacle. You can run past whatever you dont like, and engage in whatever you find fun.\n\nHowever, the pop-in is really noticeable and sometimes ruins the flow of gameplay. There have been times where ive been stopped by an invisible wall from an obstacle that didnt load in yet and it is very frustrating. Additionally, the jump kills any sense of momentum you have. For control, this works great. but for speed, it feels pretty bad.\n\nKronos and Ares island were really fun, i loved the ambient music for both of them and i loved how the game let you freely traverse where you wanted to go. There are many mini obstacle courses throughout the islands and you can choose to go where you want, and if something isnt fun you can just leave it. But just moving around and getting collectibles was really fun. And traversing to any part of these 2 islands were very easy.\n\nThe same, however, cannot be said for Chaos island. Chaos island had a frustrating amount of forced 2d segments that you were sent into from any spring or dash pad. It was hard to see what was ahead because of the forced perspective, each section felt sluggish, and overall i found myself ignoring these obstacle courses because i was not having fun with them. Whats worse, is that in the previous 2 islands there would be these markers that you could cyloop to get a lot of memory tokens. Chaos island has these too, but instead of memory tokens they are just springs or dash pads that send you flying into these 2D sections uncontrollably.\nMeanwhile, the map is segmented between a bunch of islands and it is really hard to find out how to get where you need to go.\n\nNow most people were upset about Rhea not being a full blown island, but i really liked the break from formula on climbing the towers. The epic music and fun platforming while climbing comically tall towers, all while the dread of watching really grabbed back my attention and made me want to keep playing. And after the mess that was Chaos, when i started ouranos island i was just happy to experience the freedom of kronos island again. It was disappointing to see that it had the same aesthetics, but i still found the last island to be enjoyable.\n\nThe combat in this game is definitely new and fresh, but it needs balancing and more incentives. My enjoyment on combat was mixed, sometimes it was very fun and satisfying, sometimes it was a chore. Some of the guardians were really fun to fight! Some of them were just quick time events (looking at you shark) and were far from engaging.\nMost combat moves learned from the skill tree were just different finishers used by different buttons, but were functionally the same. Or you get sonic boom, which is just ""hold down the trigger to win"". But then you get a really cool ability like quick cyloop, or tricks which are completely separate from combat! There is a lot of potential, but ultimately the skill tree just needs more unique abilities and not just finishers that look different.\nThe parry is also incredibly overpowered and abuseable, unlike in other games with parries you can just hold it forever with no sense of timing. You can even cheese the jump rope challenges by holding parry midair, you just float motionless in the air and it does not feel like something that should have made it into the final game.\n\nBut there is one thing that the skill tree really augments: the titans. The first 3 titans were some of the most fun and excited i have been playing sonic in such a long time. The music is awesome and pumps you up, the moves are flashy and cool, and everything is over the top in such a spectacular way. And unlike previous games where super sonic has a completely different moveset, your combat abilities now stay the same and instead are super flashy and deal massive damage. The first time i faced giganto i had goosebumps and was screaming out loud. It was so exciting.\n\nOn replay though, the epicness does kinda dwindle with the knowledge that you can just hold parry and win really easily. There is no downside to using it all the time, there is no timing to it. The wyvern fight was awesome the first time i played it because i had no idea you could parry the missiles, so i had to dodge left and right while constantly moving. Boosting felt like a risk because i could easily get hit. But on a replay i could just hold parry and skip the chase phase entirely once 1 missile gets reflected. Basically: the titan fights are really easy. Once you get over the awesome music and spectacle they really lack any form of challenge, and aren\'t as fun as when you first faced them. Its also criminal that there is currently no way to replay any of the titans unless you have a save file you save right before the fight. Though hopefully DLC will fix this.\n\nCyberspace is a mixed bag, sometimes the levels are really fun and other times they just dont fit sonic\'s movement well. For some baffling reason they decided to make sonic\'s turning while boosting in the 3d levels a lot stiffer in cyberspace, which makes playing as intended a lot less fun than it could be. The 2d stages meanwhile are slow and floaty, overall i didnt like them as much\nHowever, with the unintended mechanic of homing attack cancelled boost, you can go zooming past the stages and it is actually a lot of fun. plus, its easy to pull off, all you need to do is press homing attack then hold the boost before you hit anything. Trying to break the intended path to get a very low time has been the most fun i\'ve had with these stages. 1-2 especially, with the absurdly tight S rank time it was realy fun to optimize it. Its a shame no other level has such a tight time like 1-2 did.\n\nThe music? absolute god tier. every part of the soundtrack is genius, and ive been listening to the different songs all throughout the game on spotify ever since it released. Every cyberspace level has unique music with different styles, theres a freaking lofi track for fishing, the beautiful melancholic music of the open zone, or the adrenaline pumping metal that plays during the titan fights. There is something for everyone here, and as someone with very wide music tastes i appreciate all of it. (except for that one song that plays during that ONE sage cutscene in chaos island, the singing is off key and it sounds like nails on a chalk board to me. i hate it)\nAnd the music that plays in the credits? The lyrics had me tearing up.\n\nso overall? Sonic frontiers is a mix of a lot of things, many of which are fun but could be better. And yet it gives you so much freedom to do what you want, that you can just skip the parts you dislike. Everything about this game makes me really excited for the future of sonic as well as the DLC. Plus, hearing Kishimoto on twitter actively listen to feedback and talk about him wanting to fix problems with the game has me incredibly hopeful. The highs of this game are incredibly high, and while there are certainly an amount of lows in this game, you either forgive and forget, or you can just ignore them entirely and never have to encounter them. 7/10.']"

So, it’s not mandatory to complete everything in the open areas, yet I did anyways because of how fun it was.\n\n\nThe open areas are the highlight of the game, you'll easily get sidetracked and wander off to do puzzles or platforming challenges somewhere else. So, going from A to B never felt like a chore and I never wanted to fast travel.\nSonic's fluid mechanics and physics is the factor that makes traversing the map and completing the challenges fun, you can partake in precise platforming sections whilst being fast. I just wish its world had more style to it rather than being a realistic looking terrain with floating rails and platforms scattered around it. Even though these generic assets are what the maps mainly consist of, it’s fun to go through them and complete their respective challenges which I fully credit Sonic's well-tuned movement for. Keep in mind that custom structures, terrain, ramps and loop-de-loops are currently present in the maps but are overshadowed by the abundance of low effort floating assets. there are also these wall climbable walls, but climbing most of them is too automated with the included dashpanels that fling you forward.\n\n\nCombat is also well executed and feels responsive, it’s easier than most action games but it’s not mindless button mashing. Enemies are unique and their designs are great, I really enjoyed fighting the mini bosses. Although for some of them you have to wait for an opening which kills the flow of the fights and makes encounters cumbersome. The main boss fights at the end of an open area are the cherry on top, the heavy rock music really pumps the adrenaline into your blood.\nThe actual problem with the combat is the balancing. The left side combos of the skill tree are easy to execute, they are better described as cutscenes rather than combos; most of them require only two input presses - whilst making you invulnerable - and you're more likely to execute them by accident. Annoying thing about this is that to start some combos you have to use your movement/mobility abilities like jumping or boosting, which you normally use to evade and run around enemies; after you unlock said combos, you’ll most definitely accidentally start a combo when you just wanted to gap close your enemy.\nAlso upgrading Sonic’s attack damage and defense makes the game really easy, it’s much more fun to make fights longer and not one-shot enemies.The above-mentioned points are balance problems though, they could be tweaked and modded; So, If I ever wanted to replay this game, I’d simply avoid unlocking most of the left side skill tree combos and keep Sonic’s attack damage and defense at level 1.\n\n\nCyberspaces are linear short stages that have the same formula as old Sonic levels, but for some reason the design team decided to change Sonic's perfectly fine physics and movement from the open world just to accommodate for the smaller and narrower level design, the best platformers have enjoyable movement and physics that are complemented by their level design which Sonic Frontiers’ Cyberspaces fail to do.\nMost of the stages here are a permutation of slightly altered level layouts from previous Sonic games with different themes that are also from previous games, with only 4 themes at that.\nThey copied older stage layouts with no regards to Sonic’s movement and then tweaked the base physics to balance him for the said stages. you have two different feeling Sonics, the one in the open area feels good and the one you control in the cyberspace stages feels unresponsive and janky. Cyberspace Sonic steers much worse in higher speeds than the open area version and feels clunky, you lose your momentum when jumping, top speed is also heavily nerfed and besides the initial burst of speed you cannot feel the impact of boosting when holding it.\nThe challenges like collecting all red star rings and getting a S rank are a lot easier, not a single level had complexity in its Red Star placements, you can collect all of the rings in a single run and not bother at all with the branching paths, and besides a couple of stages getting a S rank wasn’t challenging at all.\nTo be fair not all of these stages are a slog, some are enjoyable. There are original stages that do not copy old level layouts which were fine. Some levels use stage layouts from Sonic Adventure 2 (2001) which fit Sonic’s Cyberspace physics quite well, the copy pasted levels from the Boost Era (2008-Present) make me want to play the games that the levels are actually based on.\n\n\nI want to commend Ian Flynn’s story writing and how he respected each character’s development from the past 30 years. Since he himself is a Sonic fan, you can see how meaningful the character conversations are here.\n\n\nI nominated this game for the best Soundtrack at the Steam Awards, loved mostly all tracks the game had to offer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs discussed in this review, the open zone sections carry your experience, you spend more time exploring the open world than engaging enemies in combat or playing the Cyberspace stages, so it was fun overall. it’s also gorgeous looking and performs well, I didn’t have many bugs besides the obvious pop-ins which they should patch. The frame rate was also smooth, I heard the Switch version is also performing well and has steady 30 fps. So buy it if you're a fan, wait for a sale if you're not. giving it a 74/100."", ""Summary\nIn short, Sonic Frontiers is a flawed but amazing experience. Like most Sonic games, it has it's fair share of issues but instead the majority of those issues being flaws on a fundamental level, most of Frontiers' issues stem from subtle performance hiccups and a lackluster endgame. Other then that, Frontiers is one of the best Sonic games I have ever played, featuring a solid gameplay structure, amazing boss fights, and a great soundtrack. The game left me wanting more and I don't mean that in a bad way!\n\nOverall, I'd give Sonic Frontiers a solid 8/10!\n\n\nThe Negative\nStarting with the bad stuff, the obvious place to start is the performance. The game runs beautifully and never once frame dropped or crashed on me, however, the pop-in is extremely annoying. There was no attempt to mask it (like a fade-in effect or something) and sometimes objects don't appear until you're right on top of them. Truth be told it was never an issue during a casual playthrough for me but the more you play it the more you notice it.\nThe achievements for Frontiers are pathetic. The time it takes to 100% the game is laughable and that's because the lack of achievements in some instances is questionable. There is no achievement for completing all of the missions in all of the cyberspace levels. There is no achievement for getting all of the in-game collectibles. There is a lack of achievements for combat outside of the main bosses, only having one achievement that requires a specific action to be completed 50 times (). It did hurt knowing that there isn't much to do for 100% completion unless you want to self-impose a 200% challenge where you collect everything.\nThe end of the game is pretty weak. To summarize it without spoilers, the last 2 islands are underwhelming and the secret final boss you get from beating the game on hard mode is baffling and I honestly wish the game didn't have it at all. The game starts to drag a bit near the end of the third island but ultimately wraps up before it becomes detrimental to the experience.\nWhile I don't hate the cyberspace levels (I'll explain further in the positives), in a pre-release interview Takashi Izuka said that those portions of the games were included because they believed some people didn't want entirely new gameplay. That alone made me furious. Everyone that has kept up with the series had begun to loath the boost formula and the linear design. The boost gameplay peaked with Sonic Generations back in 2011 and that's where it should've stayed. I hope going forward, Sonic Team tries to do new exciting things as opposed to holding on to old things that worked years ago as a make-shift crutch.\n\nSonic is really fun to control. You can customize him anyway you want and while most people just cranked the sliders to max it's still a cool option. Unless you're on rails, momentum is a bit limited but is still fun to mess with. Sonic's range of moves is a huge step up from Sonic Forces and while most additions are great, the drop dash was surprisingly pathetic. You would mainly want to use it in the cyberspace levels to gain speed on slopes more efficiently but it reacts super weird and isn't worth using. I don't want them to get rid of it since using it in the open zones to chain together movement options is a treat.\nThe Cyberspace levels, while pretty lame on their own, became way more enjoyable once you realize that Sonic can cancel a homing attack by boosting to gain an insane amount of momentum. Whether intentional or not, it takes the cyberspace levels from being a negative to becoming a positive. It's so fun to break the levels and makes you feel really cool despite the fact you're most likely a grown man playing a Sonic game.\nThe boss fights are easily the highlight of the game. I don't know how the series that is infamous for having the worst boss fights in gaming managed to make some of the best bosses in platforming history but they made some truly memorable fights.\nThe combat, while not anything special, makes me extremely optimistic for how they could improve it. It's a solid foundation, I just think they need less attack options and more movement options or skill boosts on the skill tree and it's perfect! While it can be a little button-mashy, it's not super tedious and can be quite fun if you learn how to effectively string together moves!\nThe music is very interesting, containing a variety of tracks that all sound great (outside of a few cyberspace levels). The boss music made my jaw drop and the open zone tracks are lovely. EDM isn't my favorite genre but I'll admit that some of the cyberspace tracks were pretty good but most were bad.\nThe story isn't award-winning but Ian Flynn has been writing these characters for over a decade and it shows. I legitimately couldn't stop smiling whenever Sonic and Knuckles interacted and the story actually kept me invested. I'm so glad that Ken Pontac and Warren Graff are gone because after dealing with their awful and cheap writing for over a decade, I don't know if I could've handled another atrocious script. Flynn thankfully delivers, although he can get a bit obsessed with throwing in too many references.\nThe freedom in the game is extremely refreshing. There is multiple ways you can progress through that game and that freedom actually makes me forgive a lot of glaring problems because if I don't want to do something, I simply don't have to.\n\nAfter being disappointed with Lost World, upset with Sonic Boom, and bent over with Sonic Forces, the fact that Sonic Frontiers ended up being decent meant the world to me. It showed me that Sonic Team was still capable of good things after a decade of fumbling. I'm honestly shocked the game was worth the 60 USD price tag and them some, especially since the modding scene has already cracked the game wide open. If you enjoy platformers, do yourself a favor and pick this one up!"", ""As a long time fan, Sonic Frontiers is the most fun I’ve had with a 3D Sonic game since Sonic Generations. This game does have issues, but as a whole, Sonic Frontiers is a really good time and moves the series a few steps in the right direction.\n\nThe story is a large improvement from the last few games. Throughout the last few Sonic games, the characters have felt butchered. Most characters were either made really dumb, annoying, or just plain pitiful. There were a lot of jokes and dialogue which rather than being funny, made my eyes roll or had me cringe. Sonic Frontiers corrects most of these issues and even improves the cast overall. The story tackles elements like the origins of the Chaos Emeralds, Cyberspace, an Ancient Civilization, and brings in references and events from past games within character interactions.\n\nI appreciated the callbacks in the story and the new antagonist Sage is also a fairly well-developed character throughout the story. While I enjoyed story overall, some cutscenes didn’t quite work for me. Also, some cutscenes are stiffly animated and I feel the ending could have been better as it just sort of fizzles out instead of being grand or epic. With that said, the story did keep me engaged throughout and has some exceptional character growth and even some good arcs. Props to the writers for making these characters have actual depth.\n\nSonic Frontiers gameplay is really fun. I believe Sonic hasn’t controlled this well since the Adventure series. I found the moment-to-moment gameplay exploring and platforming across the islands to be really enjoyable throughout the entire game. I enjoyed platforming around finding memory tokens, completing small puzzles, and doing mini-games. There are puzzle types that repeated a little too often and some are just okay, but I appreciated that most of them were quick and never felt like a chore. I never found myself getting bored and there was rarely an instance where there wasn't something to do.\n\nThere are traditional type levels in this game called Cyberspace. I didn’t care for the stages initially. However, when I got used to them, I found them to be really fun, and some of the later ones I enjoyed a lot. I find that Cyberspace levels are at their best when speedrunning them. Performing a Homing Dash by boosting immediately after doing a homing attack can send you flying. I wish there were more than 4 themes in Cyberspace as some of the ones present have been done so much from previous entries. Fishing with Big the Cat is simple, but fun type of simple.\n\nI thought the combat was decent. I did like the various moves you could unlock and it was satisfying chaining combos together. Parrying was a little too easy once I figured out how the mechanic worked. There was some good enemy variety with most being fine, but there are a few annoying ones. I found the mini-bosses and especially the Super Sonic Bosses to be very good. The Super Sonic Bosses are a highlight of the game in general. Unfortunately, the Final Boss was a disappointment to me. It didn’t ruin my experience, and it was definitely unique compared to all prior Final Bosses, but it could have been better.\n\nFor general issues: the pop-in is pretty bad, there is a bit of jank to the controls and bosses, and camera control is taken away a little too often. But despite all the problems I listed and a lack of overall polish, Sonic Frontiers was just really fun while playing it and the good outweighs the bad much more often.\n\nThe music in Sonic Frontiers is AMAZING! This may be my favorite soundtrack in the series. I loved it all, from softer island music to the EDM Cyberspace songs to the head-banging Titan Boss vocal tracks. It was all done extremely well.\n\nGraphically this game is very good. Most of the environments are nice to look at and there are some beautiful sites, however, pop-in does detract from it. The Cyberspace levels also look good despite the theme re-usage.\n\nTo summarize the pros and cons:\n\nPros: story, characters, references, open zone platforming, movement controls, mini-games, cyberspace levels, combat moves, enemy variety, mini-bosses, Super Sonic bosses, fishing, the entire soundtrack, and visuals.\n\nCons: stiff cutscenes, camera issues, jank, visual pop-in, lack of level themes, and a disappointing Final Boss.\n\nThe final score I give Sonic Frontiers is an 8/10. I liked this game a lot. I hope Sonic Team sticks with this formula because they really have something here. Also, keep Ian Flynn on the writing team please, he did a great job with the characters. If this is able to be improved on we might just get the greatest Sonic game yet. The future looks bright and I look forward to what happens next… across these new frontiers.""]"

I PISSED ON THE MOON, YOU IDIOT!!! YOU HAVE 23 HOURS BEFORE THE PISS DROPLETS HIT THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ EARTH, NOW GET OUT OF MY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SIGHT BEFORE I PISS ON YOU TOO.', 'Sonic the Hedgehog. One of the greatest and most attractive characters ever thought up. He can run at sound speed, take out enemies in a flash, and best of all, he\'s blue colored and knows how to handle the females. Speaking of females, the Sonic universe might also be classified as ""Hot Chick Heaven"" because there\'s such a mess of very beautiful and tough women that it will make you love the franchise even more! And since Valentine\'s Day is around the corner, I\'ve been inspired to make a top 10 list of the most beautiful female Sonic characters. Grab yourself a snack and a glass of orange juice, and try not to reach through the screen because HERE WE GO!\n\n10: Try this question on for size. Who chases and hugs Sonic all the time and wields a powerful hammer? Why it\'s Amy Rose of course! Though more of a cutie than a hottie, you can\'t deny the fact that she\'s still attractive. Two things that make her attractive are the fact that she wears a dress, and when have you ever seen 3 big, very smooth arcs of hair sticking out of a person\'s forehead? I haven\'t! So once again, Amy Rose is lovely; that is until she goes berserk and starts hitting stuff with her hammer.\n\nWho\'s at number 9? It\'s this alien plant girl from a distant planet. Cosmo, from Sonic X. She arrived on the character\'s planet to deliver a message saying that the galaxy was under attack by a force called the Metarex. She doesn\'t do much except tell people to stop fighting and focus on the real matter at hand. The real reason she lands at the #9 is that she becomes Miles ""Tails"" Prower\'s sweetheart, something Tails needed for a long while.\n\nNumero Ocho. Cream the Rabbit\'s mother, Vanilla. She\'s attractive and the size of an average human mother. What really surprises me about her is that the leader of Team Chaotix, Vector the Crocodile, falls in love with her. Kinda silly, don\'t you think? She\'s another character that doesn\'t do much, but in a season 3 episode of Sonic X, she helps Chris Thorndyke get into space to fight the Metarex along with Sonic and friends.\n\nWhat number\'s next? Seven, of course. Wave the Swallow from Sonic Riders. People always root for the good guys, but sometimes, the bad guys steal the show. Her mechanical IQ is equal to Tails. She also happens to be the smartest member of the Babylon Rogues. I wonder why she isn\'t the leader. Like Jet the Hawk and Storm the Albatross, her specialty is riding the air-boards called ""Extreme Gear"". With two very long and smooth feathers extending from her head to her calves and droopy eyes, Wave will rock your socks. If only we could see her take wing.\n\nNumero Six. Tikal the Echidna from Sonic Adventure 1. Named after an ancient Mayan city of the same name, Tikal is the daughter of Chief Pachacamac. She\'s yet another character that hardly does a thing except beg her father to stop being so greedy. She also traps herself inside the Master Emerald so that the water god Chaos doesn\'t reign terror upon the land. When you\'re the daughter of a person in the highest power, you need to look your best and Tikal delivers perfectly. That\'s why she\'s #6\n\nNumber #1, #2, #3, #4, #5! Ah-Ah-Ahhh! Mina Mongoose from the Sonic Archie comics. How could you go wrong with a girl that looks like this? She can run nearly as fast as Sonic and she went from being a Freedom Fighter to being a popstar singer. Next to Princess Sally she looks more humanoid than the other characters. Who could top someone who has long mauv hair?\n\nThis female standing at number 4: Blaze the Cat. One word: Pyrokinesis. How would you like to have that superpower? I mean Blaze could play around in the Himalayas for hours and she would be perfectly fine! Also, 45 degree ponytail makes her look like a Native American. I really like the fact that her love interest is the telekinetic hedgehog Silver. The combination of mind-moving and fire superpowers make these two a reliable couple. But what really lands Blaze in the #4 spot is that her attitudes apparently more different from the other females.\n\nNext up is #3. What\'s better than having a female with cascading quills? How about a female with cascading quills and hair? Julie-Su the Echidna, another Archie comic exclusive has that feature. She\'s smart, knows exactly what to do as a freedom fighter, and even trained Amy once. She\'s also the girl of Knuckles\' dreams. Heh, lucky him. Her older self in the series Mobius: X Years Later is just downright hot! Just look at that long ponytail! Now we\'re talkin\'!\n\n1, 2, button my shoe! Princess Sally Acorn. There\'s a lot to say about this character. She\'s the heir to the throne, Sonic\'s first official romance, the only character that used to not wear clothes, brave and athletic, the most humanoid character, and is like a mother to Tails. In the TV show, Sonic SatAM, one Freedom Fighter, the cowardly Antoine constantly tries to woo Sally, but doesn\'t succeed because... he\'s a coward! The Princess is also a semi-perfect example of an excellent love interest, although there were a couple of times when she really snapped and acted like a lunatic; in the comics, that is. But overall, Sally Acorn really stands out amongst the slew of females not just because she\'s Sonic\'s first official love interest, or because she\'s the only one who didn\'t wear clothes, but because in the comics, she grew very long hair, and married Sonic in the future, becoming the Queen.\n\nSo, you\'ve seen a pyrokinetic Cat, a swallow, two gorgeous echidnas, and even a princess! Who could possibly top those kinds of females? Well, get ready folks; this is the #1 hottest Sonic the Hedgehog female character. Rouge the Bat. If anybody denies it, how dare you? This woman can fly, she\'s as strong as Knuckles, and is a femme fatale, seducing other characters into getting what she wants. Instead of having one love interest, she has two! Knuckles, and Shadow the Hedgehog. Being a treasure thief, she\'s only interested in one object set; jewels, especially the Chaos Emeralds. There actually have been situations where Rouge\'s cleavage has been exposed, but it eventually got censored. What a price to pay. I think the best part about this beauty is that she wears three different outfits unlike the other female characters. And who wouldn\'t want to fly across the landscape via strong as Shawn Johnson, and flirt with any male, anytime, anywhere. These three traits make Rouge the Bat triumph over all of the Sonic the Hedgehog females. My hat goes off to you Sonic Team USA. You oughta be proud.\n\nThere ya have it folks. Those were the hottest female chicks in the Sonic universe. I hope you enjoyed it, happy Valentine\'s Day\n\n\n-Guptil89', 'I\'VE COME TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

This is a big step up from Forces but that's not really saying much. Open Area gameplay is fun and the game genuinely feels good to control. The game's biggest downfall is probably cyberspace, the movement from the open areas does not carry over to cyberspace levels and it can honestly feel really sluggish to go through. Visually this game is really nice to look at, however the pop-in can really break the immersion. It'd be nice if there were a setting to increase draw distance or something of the sort, but the graphics settings are very basic. There are no medium settings, it's only high or low. The game is also capped at 60 FPS which is a bit of a bummer since it would be nice to see a game like this run at higher refresh rates. I'd say waiting for a sale is probably the best choice. I'm sure modders can do a good job at tinkering with the game to better suit my liking.\n\nSide Note: The OST ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ slaps. First boss of the game literally has final boss music."", ""The game is great. Not perfect, but by far the best foot forward the series has had in years. Controls are mostly solid, my only real complaint I've run into being the Camera being a bit troublesome in main boss fights, the story is solidly the best part of the game thus far, and the character interaction is great as well.\n\nThe open world aspect of it is interested and while a couple of the enemies are more annoying than challenging but the field bosses are quite something. The Cyberspace Levels play out well for the most part, but boosting can be a bit hard to control at some points. The times required for S-rank can be rather challenging on some levels.\n\nOverall, I'd say this is a solid 8/10, and would greatly suggest it to fans of the series, and it's probably the best starting point for new folks to the series in a long, long time"", ""Without a doubt the best game since generations. The open world gameplay is hands down some of the best the series has ever had but the cyberspace levels feel a little shallow compared to even some of the bonus stages in games like generations or unleashed but some of the later ones do start picking up the slack quite a bit. But since the open world is where you're at most of the time those aren't a huge concern. The story was also probably one of the most well rounded in the series being paced pretty well and even with some complaints about the ending being a bit of a fizzle I thought that it concluded nicely even if there was a bit of a quick wrap up. Overall I'd say it's just barely behind the best of modern and adventure era for me but if you want a fun game that has a lot to give this is definitely one to try out. 8.5/10\n\nThat was what I thought of the game prior to the story expansion update. The new update basically fixed any issues I had with the game before, platforming is way more complex and skill based, the final story has been way more fleshed out an interesting than it was previously, and they've managed to create a sort of blend of Unleashed/Generations and the first Adventure game but have taken mostly just the best parts of both gameplay loops and combined them really well. I still have to finish the end of the expansion so it might not maintain this level till the end but with a majority of it done I have to say this is what should have been here at launch to get a 10/10 for me in terms of a Sonic game. Especially if you do some modding to it to iron out a few of the issues here and there with a physics mod like Trackers Physics it might be some of the best content the series has had. Wait to go Sonic Team for absolutely blowing it away just for a free story expansion.""]"

My pc is more than capable of handling this game, but after I spent way too much time fixing the graphics options crashes so I could even get into the game, I spent 3 hours trying -everything- I could in game and on my pc, it just wouldn\'t play above like 5fps. Really poor performance seems to be a common issue for a lot of NVIDIA geforce users.\n\nI can\'t say what I do and don\'t like about the gameplay itself, since I literally can\'t play it, but the UI is clunky (I didn\'t care too much tbh), consistent, repeatable crashes that happen -every- time I navigated through graphics options or whenever I pause the game (the fix I found for the graphics options crashes was from a sonic origins game fix... so they literally haven\'t even fixed previous well known issues), uses Denuvo, so internet will affect the game and performance and the game will one day be unusable unless they remove that, and performance overall is so poor to a point that the game is -literally- unplayable. All things that would be expected or acceptable out of an early access game, not as much with a full release AAA title at full price that had been delayed significantly to -fix- issues and performance. There are a significant amount of pc users with the same exact problems, and I find it hard to believe the devs didn\'t notice the game literally not working. It looks like even the switch version runs better.\n\nTLDR, this game does seem to be the best game they have done in decades with some solid music and story, but for me that doesn\'t mean much since I can\'t even get past the opening tutorial. After all the delays, they still released a dumpster of a game for the pc version. Them releasing it in such a state has been a refreshing reminder to myself to just forget that I used to love sonic. My bar was really low for this game to begin with. I didn\'t think I was expecting a miracle, I just wanted to try the new sonic game, but I guess a ""working"" game was too much to ask for.', 'Denuvo.', ""Product refunded\n\nGreat game, had a lot of fun with on the Switch, so why is the review negative? Yeah it's Denuvo, but it's also the optimization of this port. For whatever reason with my copy of the game there are these horrible lag spikes that cause the game to stutter and freeze for 7 seconds at a time and cause my CPU usage to go up to 100%, making my whole computer unusable during it. I have tried everything I could to fix it, but to no avail, even contacted SEGA support only to get tips that I could of just googled and done in less than a day rather than almost of week of back and forward emails, Almost didn't get a refund because of how long I took trying to troubleshoot the game. My specs are at the very least in the minimum requirements and just nearly hit the recommended requirements, the game even ran at around 50-60 fps on high settings whenever it wasn't having a stroke trying to have Sonic run around some unreal asset island or Sonic Generations assets. The only thing I can think of that is causing the game to do this is bad optimization or Denuvo DRM, maybe both, who knows, I'm not a game developer and I haven't played newer PC games for a while since I didn't have the hardware to do so until now.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend people to be wary when buying this game and if you have the same issue I did, just refund the game, there is no fix for it and I'd doubt there's going to be patch for it given how only a handful of people seem to have gotten it, even people who have pretty beefy specs have apparently gotten the same issue, which is ridiculous because a game that looks like this shouldn't be having these kind of issues. I'll probably be staying away from any games with Denuvo DRM in them for the foreseeable future to avoid this from ever happening to me again.\n\nMy specs for people who care so they can laugh at me or whatever.\nOS: Windows 11 Pro\nProcessor: Intel Core i5-9400\nRAM: 32 GB\nGPU: AMD Radeon RX 580\nSSD: PNY CS900""]"

I even refused to buy it for full price, waiting until it went on sale to grab it. However, I think this game turned out to be worth the full price.\n\nIf there's one thing this game is not, it's lacking content. I was honestly surprised how many times this game seemed to surprise me. I expected the open world gimmick to get relatively stale within a handful of hours, and I expected to clear all the islands relatively quickly. But instead, although there was a lot of similar moments, there was also a major surprisingly amount of new twist and moments they throw at you. The types of obstacles they use, the types of environments you get thrown into, they don't repeat nearly as much as I thought, and I could tell they had some people really doing what they could to keep things fresh all the way through. Every time I think I've seen all an island has to offer, I find out there's an entire segment of the island, sometimes underground, sometimes in the sky, sometimes just behind a certain corner that I never looked for, there would be an entire new theme of challenges and environments I hadn't seen before. This kept me consistently engaged, wanting to see the next interesting thing they had to throw at me. Although there was a ton of those little platform challenges across the open world, no two of them were the same, and most of them made good use of the environment they were in. I think it kept surprising me enough that this game definitely deserves the full price. There's a ton of content in this game if you're willing to take your time and look for it.\nAnd of course, the gameplay itself is very fun. Running is fast and satisfying, the cyberspace levels (although not as fast and engaging as Generations or Unleashed,) are still very fun and interesting to go through, with many making me want to replay numerous times to beat my record time, which any good sonic game should do.\nIf you buy it for full price, you'll get your money's worth, believe me. It doesn't do as good as it may had potential to do, but it does plenty right to warrant a look into."", ""This game is freaking awesome.\n\nI don't know if I would have ever paid or if I would ever recommend it at full price- but I picked this up for ~$25 USD. This game has its shortcomings which I will mention soon, but overall I would highly recommend playing this.\n\nIt's like if Breath of the Wild was fun. Tears of the Kingdom I got about 70 hours out of but never finished since it was too boring. This game constantly, after about 14 hours in as of writing this, KEEPS THROWING NEW MECHANICS AT ME!!!\n\nSome of the bad I mentioned is almost perfectly summarized in the third island you visit called Chaos Island. The biggest problem is traversal, it's confusing, the map is slow and inconsistent, fast travel via menus is annoying to obtain (needs to be grinded in fishing, and some may HATE this minigame. I absolutely love it). The traversal is made its worst here for the map not showing how to actually get anywhere, but the worst part is this map is filled with 2d sections that lock your camera and movement into 2d whenever you enter them. The issue is when going at high speeds you WILL run into these by accident, and some you simply can not escape until you've gone through ALL of it. This admittedly frustrated me quite badly while playing.\n\nDifficulty within the 2d stages in the game (yes, there are also full on 2d stages!) varies wildly. Some of these are so easy that I get an S rank while dying in the stage or wasting time. 1-2 on the very first world is actually a bit challenging and requires some decent time saving thoughts. I was hoping this trend would continue, and it kind of did? It seems random. You can argue that this is due to the open world nature of the game, but each world could easily get progressively difficult in these 2d stages in my opinion. Especially since they do get harder in one amazing way:\n\nLearned mechanics and application of said mechanics.\n\nThis is game design 101, and while you may say this is the bare minimum for a game to pass, we're talking about a Sonic game. Let's be honest, base game design can be a hard ask sometimes from the Sonic Team (this is mostly in jest, I promise).\n\nall seriousness, you are taught mechanics like dodging very early, and dashing across rings by pressing a button. Neither of these moves are entirely mandatory but can help make you go faster. So you aren't heavily punished for NOT using them, but you're instead extremely motivated to try to use them in order to optimize your game play (quick sidenote, it's not a lame Dark Souls level parry, you literally just hold a button lol, barely any timing needed). Feeling myself get better at using these mechanics in the first stage felt really cool, because I wasn't forced to use these... I was offered them and I got better because I practiced with them.\n\nTraveling across rings was used a lot early on to make things faster, while not being NEEDED. But... guess what? World 2 comes along and BAM, there's a couple sections that show you early on that there is a huge path of rings through a great locked camera position. This is a required area to use this ability, you must use it to progress in a handful of locations in World 2. Now, keep in mind each of these positions are shown VERY early in your pathing through a smart camera lock. But none are sudden. World 3, BAM. There are sudden ones that require quick thinking to progress.\n\nI can go even further explaining this. Even the most core mechanic of dashing to an enemy or object goes from very easy and simple, while doing so effectively can allow for very fast optimizations, meanwhile later on in World 2 and 3 there are plenty of required quick presses of that button.\n\nQuick gushing about bosses. Fighting the first boss without the 7 emeralds then fighting it later with the emeralds feels awesome. Each boss feels progressively cooler. None of them are difficult, but that's... in my opinion okay. You are super sonic in these fights, and because of that... you feel powerful.\n\nThere aren't enough animations for super sonic, and for some reason the game doesn't support above 60fps nor does it support ultrawide monitors. One other annoying thing is on AMD graphics the water is super buggy in fishing. Nothing game play wise is hurt by this, thankfully. These are minor gripes though for me, just mentioning them in case you feel these are deal breakers. Oh, and the story sorta sucks. The characters rock though, and it's entertaining and honestly more compelling than both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom despite my bias leaning towards Zelda 100% in gaming.\n\nI am again, ONLY 14 hours in and absolutely have an incredible perception of this game. For reference, I despise open world games and especially souls like games. This game is extremely friendly for beginners.\n\nLet's finish with the best part of every Sega title: The freaking music!\n\nThis OST feels like the game itself, a slightly grown up version of Sonic! Replacing the butt rock with easy-core, which for reference is essentially the butt rock equivalent of post-hardcore music. The tracks here rule. Collecting extra tracks in game is icing on this cake. I wish there were more, personally. Maybe instead make them unlockable via fishing? That would give me TONS of incentive to grind fishing. Sega, use that OST! Everyone knows Sega games are well known for their amazing soundtracks.\n\nEDIT: Finished the title days later. I keep all my words from above. What an incredible game!! I am doing the after story content right now and the exclusive music for Amy is also lovely.\n\nThanks for reading if you did. I will leave an update above this when I finish the game."", ""I wasted so much money on this POS. Fishing to skip the game was the only good part. Zero level design except when taken from better games. Flynn did ok with the writing but it banks on the hope that there'll be something later and is very rushed. Softlocked in ares island cause the game is actually too good for me. I don't remember a single original track from the game so I can't comment on that really. Gameplay was extremely uninteresting and became repetitive. Ikaruga is really cool but I don't know how this watered down version of it made it into the game. Awesome ending though. Really, and I mean REALLY enjoyed how cool and awesome the final boss was. Definitely the highlight of my experience on this hedgehog-based earth we live in. Chaos island like everyone says sucks but forgets to mention that chaos island isn't an outliar in poor map design.\n\nOnly redeeming part is some of the characterisation. Just play any fishing game if you want the enjoyable parts for cheaper.\n\nOverall no rouge the bat and black doom really hold back this game from coming into its own and the lack of zavok and infinite (the dynamic duo) are massive missed opportunities from the team. Played this game back to front adding this for update 3 would definitely make this game a 12/1 just like the classics. Also bring back yuji naka because he zeriously carried the development of these games\n\nUPDATE: final horizon released and I have to say that they did nothing I said so it's pretty bad. The pop in got worse but I'm pretty sure that's just because I'm a bad player and that's also why they didn't balance the platforming and trials well. I also had like zero reason to level up as amy tail and knackle. I would have liked to be able to play the characters that the expansion revolve around and were paraded around a lot for the marketing. Also why can't there be cyberspace levels designed for them. Even if it was two or three it would be interesting to see how bad they could design each level for the three guys (and girl). This game has NO SWEARING, NO CUSSING and best of all, lots of bugs and animal crossing has bugs which is by nintentdon't so that must mean the game bad :). Anyway please find a way to mod knackle and tail as zavok and super duper zavok (my oc (link to deviantart)). Even on easy a lot of the trials required needlessly tight execution and knowledge of mechanics that hadn't been demonstrated to the player due to poor design earlier. This expansion feels rushed (planning-wise) but I do appreciate it being free even if the only seconds I enjoyed was in a plane and exploiting knuckles' ability to uppercut inifinitely. If they ever remove that mechanic the game will be a -1/10 but for now it is good enough to be a 3! (out of 100 (sick, roasted liberals owned and pwned :sunglasses:)). I refuse to take this series seriously for the next 50 years of my life. Oh yeah they also got rid of fishing so 1/10000 or whatever. Please make another good game sega I've been waiting since generations for a good game and been waiting since unleashed for a decent story. This expansion is basically all of my criticisms but like more I guess yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Sonic GO!""]"

Is the animation, graphics and voice acting acceptable for a video games in 2022? Absolutely not, dose this add something good to the sonic franchise as a whole...... well kinda, I think they really hit the mark with combat and music but i feel like the formula is missing something that made past sonic games better. I commend them for taking on the challenge of an open world sonic game. It gives me hope that they found a direction for sonic from this, because the concept really can be amazing for this game, but here I think it falls just short of being what I believe we all hoped it would be. Is it the best thing since sliced bread for sonic? No, but it's an ok game that hopefully taught the sonic team some lessens, so they can take what was learned from this game and make something even better in the future that meets all of our expectations for the sonic game we all want to play."", 'do not read if you don\'t want any spoilers.\n\nUpdate 3 legit improves a lot, because before update 3 all i did in the final island was fishing the items, and then beat a purple moon, where on easy or normal you basically only had to do 3 really easy quick time events, or on hard the most boring boss in the game, because you basically have i frames with the white and red orbs, plus can destroy any challenge with ""the end"" boss, thanks to the super sonic meter weapon.\n\nUpdate 3 now allows you do do way more stuff than just fishing, because you can basically play Amy the most balanced character, knuckles where it can bypass platforming sections, and tails is basically spectator mode because you can fly around anywhere, and sonic basically have these cool challenging towers, that put your platforming skills to the test.\n\nWhile the trials i understand what they were going for, but i think its badly done, because the 1st or 4th trial, you have to think outside the box to beat them, while the second or third trial you have to time parry, and of course the most hated one trial 5.\n\nI do agree trial 5 is bad, but its not the worst thing in the game, there is a few positives i can give trial 5, because Giganto and Knight in trial 5, you basically don\'t need to parry to beat them, even on hard you don\'t have to parry, because your allowed to dodge there attacks, or use the sonic boom projectile to basically not parry Knight shield.\n\nSadly Wyvern is what ruins trial 5, because your forced to parry it to damage it, the problem with Wyvern is the attack hitbox are delayed or way to early, and the worst part is the audio cues for parry with Wyvern is gone in second phase, basically i was able to beat Wyvern with hard, by basically spam pressing q and e, by me spam pressing it as quickly as possible by pure dumb luck, and another issue is Wyvern to activate the fight take the longest, which is the problem of copying and pasting stuff, thankfully easy mode fixes all the issues i have with Wyvern, because the parry is 2 to 3 seconds long on easy in trial 5, but still even on easy i think trial 5 is bad, because on easy its boring cuz your fighting the same bosses again but worse, but on normal and hard or extreme good luck beating Wyvern because I\'m convinced its not play tested on extreme or hard mode.\n\nAnd for the final boss for update 3 its way better than ""the end,"" but it still has issues, because its designed to be poorly explained what your suppose to do to destroy the healing tube, don\'t get me wrong once you know how to destroy the healing tube, the new supreme phase is fun to fight against, and the timed parry system works well against the final boss in update 3 because its designed for it, but if you have to shove in the king koko advice system, as an excuse to tell the player you have to play cyberspace levels to know how to beat the final boss, then that\'s just an outdated game design to make update 3 way longer to play through, because people will watch a YouTube video how to beat the final boss.\n\nAnd speaking of cyberspace levels, update 3 has the best cyberspace levels in the game, why you ask because they finally do something with it, and not copy and paste sonic generations or sonic unleashed level design, where it lasts 1 minute most of the time.\n\nAnd also update 3 brings the 3 enemies from beta are now in the game, and i can say 2 of them which is tank+ or Caterpillar+ are way better than the original release version, i had to think how to beat them, the only one i understand why they ditched from beta, is spider+ because spider+ is boring, you basically just spam cyloop hoping the projectiles hit, and then attack it once spider+ is down, then you run from the auto aiming spikes, and then parry the ground spike, that\'s legit it 3 attacks,\n\nplus the narrative fixes, i absolutely hated when they ditched the cyber corruption, thankfully update 3 keeps the cyber corruption, i legit have no clue how Eggman can somehow revive sage over typing because if Eggman can revive Sage that easily why was he worried about her, now i don\'t have to see that Cut scene anymore. i can go on but you get the point.\n\nOverall the only major issues i have with sonic frontiers now, is the pop in or the pinball mini game, and that\'s about it because the other issues i have with sonic frontiers is now optional, 9/10 sonic game for me due to how much it repaired the game series, and a 8/10 game compared to other games based on my experience, this game used to be a 6/10 for me but these updates improved the game a lot.', ""Sonic is finally back.\n\nAfter Sonic Mid world and the disaster that was Forces and launch colors ultimate, we finally have a good 3D Sonic game since Generations.\nFrom the boss fights to the open world its so good, but unfortunately its not perfect.\n\nMAJOR SPOILER WARNING!.\n\nCons.\n\nThe game is way too easy even on the hardest difficulty, you don't even have to time the parry you can just hold the button down.\n\nSpending 30 minutes grinding memory tokens just to watch a 30-45 second cutscene to back to grinding more memory tokens on Kronos island.\n\nThe story minigames are bad with some being worse then others especially the Laser pointing one, the bridge one, and the Ares Island Koco roundup.\n\nThere should've been more variety with the island designs, 3/5 Islands are grassy and that could've been fixed with Ouranos Island being snow themed.\n\nThe pop in is bad and needs to be fixed.\n\nDue to Denuvo the game can sometimes hog up all of the CPU making the game freeze.\n\nGiganto Bug that drops your frames to 30 if you die.\n\nI didnt like how it cuts to a 30 FPS cutscene of Sonic throwing Wyvern against a cliff without a button prompt, while cool I still think it should've been in game without ruining the immersion by cutting to black.\n\n\nSupreme,\nHe was obviously shoehorned in with him literally being a reskin of Giganto, and the fight was almost the exact same too, any new moves the boss had were just boring too.\n\nThe Final boss for hard mode,\n\nHey you know that voice that stops you from going out of bounds and progressing too early? No? too bad.\n\nNext to no story importance, which is stupid because its supposed to be some sort of god.\n\nAnd the fight itself?. Its literally just the space invaders minigame.\n\nNow I know they were rushed and had to cut corners but really?, you couldn't have done any better?.\n\nWhew now that that's out of the way lets get to the good stuff.\n\nPros.\nThe open world is so fun to explore especially when you have full rings with infinite boost.\n\nThe combat is so fun while a little buggy at times with some moves not wanting to register (looking at you wild rush), The over all combat works well.\n\nGiganto.\nWhere do I begin, you first meet him and he demolishes you,\nthen once you have the 6 chaos emeralds you climb up him Shadow of the Colossus style and get the 7th chaos emerald and you have this incredible boss fight, with amazing music, and the overall feeling of being really powerful.\n\nThis sets a standard for Super Sonic one which will hopefully will be the case in future sonic games.\n\nKnight.\nClimbing up him Shadow of the Colossus style again was great. Riding on the shield back to him was really cool. The Boss theme is the best in the game. The 2nd phase with reflecting the shield back at him was awesome. And the end with Sonic parrying the sword and then picking it up and cutting him in half was something straight out of Metal Gear Rising and that's amazing.\n\nThe challenges to open up the map are fun.\n\nCyberspace.\nWhile a little disappointing that there's only 4 level themes, trying to get S rank and complete all of the challenges was really fun, especially 1-2. The only thing I wish was changed is more then 4 level themes, the levels being a little bit longer, and better controls for the cyberspace levels.\n\nFishing.\nIt was very interesting to bring Big the cat back who hasn't been a main character in the series since Sonic Heroes in 2003. The whole fishing minigame was also a huge reference to Sonic Adventure with the theme for catching the fish being a remix of the one from Sonic Adventure.\nIts also the best way to level up your stats with fish giving anywhere from 8 tokens to 75 depending on the size, with a tire giving you 48 tokens for some reason.\n\nClimbing up the towers was really cool and a nice change of pace from grinding memory tokens.\n\nThe sound track for this game is Amazing.\n\nThe length is perfect.\nThe game is 3x longer then sonic forces for just main plus extra,\nand that's not including the upcoming DLC and the fact that they were rushed near the end of development.\n\nAnd finally the mod support. The mod support for the game is incredible, with people already making mods before the game even came out.\n\nI'm finally glad everyone realized that the awful gameplay provided to us by Ign was an early beta build of the game and not the full game.\n\nI still remember everyone complaining about how it looked like a Unity game and how it was gonna be terrible, and how me and my friends all knew it was beta footage and that the game was gonna be good. I'm glad the game turned out how it is, while not perfect it still is in my top 5 favorite sonic games, and my 10th favorite game of all time. 8.5/10""]"

Boss fights are the most epic and grand the series has to offer, but can be gimmicky and have one trick quick time events.

All I can say is, that this one here might be the best story ever written in a sonic game. They tried to tell a more darker story with many serious friendship speeches and...\nYeah, I get it, it\'s still very edgy, but I think they did a lot better than in it\'s predecessor, sonic forces. The new character, Sage, might have a bit of a stereotypical design but her character arc was well written imo, even sonics sidekicks since they got a bit more depth, like Amy and Tails and even Eggman (Knuckles was the same es ever tho).\nEven Sonic wasn\'t on a snooze cruise, I guess and didn\'t throw in too many jokes as a comic relief which would have killed the more serious mood.\n\ngameplay\nThe game is divided into 2 main parts. The open world and the Cyberspace, which are basically the classic sonic stages.\nThe ""open zones"" are basically huge level with a lot of different platforming challenges. They are working fine enough even though it\'s not good to look at (more about that later). It\'s pretty satisfying being able to perform well timed jumps from high above to skip some of the challenges, but I\'m not sure if thats intentional. They removed some shackles from the release version to make the movement customizable and more engaging, but I think they might have broken some aspects here and there and made some of these challenges trivial. But all in all, I had a lot of fun doing 100%.\nThe cyberspace level on the other hand were very dissapointing. They are all rip offs of old level and it felt tedious to do them due to it\'s redundance (there are only 4 skins pasted all over them). So yeah, It\'s the weakest part of the main game for me.\n\nThis one has it\'s ups and downs. Music-wise they are either complete hype or forgetabble. The best ones are no doubt the titan fights and the lyric songs in general. The open zones are average, they tried a calmer approach which doesn\'t really suit sonic tbh. The cyberspace ones are straight up forgetabble or bad. I think they should have re-used the themes of the stages they are based on, I mean if you already copying the level design, you can do the same for the music, don\'t you?\nThe aesthetics are also weird. They put sonic into realistic environments with flying platforms, rails and such, which doesn\'t align with the cartoony sonic figures. There is also very ugly pop in, which could be easily fixed if there was some kind of fade effect. I mean the main theme is the cyberspace, why aren\'t the platforms coming in with some kind of pixelisque effect?\nI mean it\'s not as uncanny as sonic \'06 but still not good to look at.\n\nWell, since this one was part of some free updates, I don\'t wanna be too harsh on that, but oh boy some of these challenges are just awful to play.\nNow we have 3 more playable characters, but they only differ slightly from sonic. But all of these new moves are either overpowered or debuffs/useless. Tails for example has some kind of move where he\'s able to fly all over the map without any limits whereas he can skips almost all jumping challenges. Knuckles on the other hand has his iconic glide, but whenever you\'re starting to do that, there is a long starting animation with terrible controls\nBut even sonic has his down parts. There are some tower challenges which are straight up impossible to do them normally (on hard difficulty), because you need a very specific strategy which are difficult to come up by yourself. Some other challenges on the other hand are way too easy with more than a whole minute remaining time at the end. So yeah, it\'s pretty unbalanced with random difficulty spikes (don\'t wanna talk about the ridiculously insane damage the field bosses can make, since I ignored them as much as possible >_>).\n\nWell, this was a lot of backlash now, I know, but I can still recommend this game if you want a new sonic game. But I would suggest grabbing this on sale, because there are indeed some downer here and there, which can put you off. But most of them are part of the artistic choices, gameplay-wise it\'s an enjoyable experience with a lot of room for improving in future entries.', ""The ProsFirst things first, the game is just fun. It’s fun to run around, make cyclops, kill enemies, collect items, grind rails, all while in an open space. Sonic works really well in an open world setting makes me wonder why Sonic Team chose to keep him in hallways for the past 2 decades. I also like the story and writing. None of the dialog feels forced and the characters have natural chemistry. The writing isn’t Twin Peaks or anything but it’s still leagues better then the writing seen in Colors, Generations, Lost World, and Forces oh especially Forces. It’s just nice seeing the characters interact. And unlike previous games the zaniness has been toned down considerably. It’s still here with Sonic making quips from time to time but it isn’t so much that it’s annoying. And I feel like this tone change is shown the best in Sonic’s voice direction. Roger Craig Smith has tweaked the Sonic voice going for a more deeper and mellow type voice. Seems like he’s trying to match Jason Griffith’s performance. Sonic has mellowed out over the years, no longer this impatient wise cracking guy. He still makes quips but it’s no longer his entire personality. I like this a lot. Sage is also a good character, she’s actually being built up and given more of a personality unlike another Sonic villain who is red and black. The platforming sections can be annoying at times but otherwise still fun since if you can do it without messing up then it’s super satisfying. The combat is also really good. It can be button mashy at times but I’ve 100% Spiderman PS4 so I don’t mind. This game really does share a lot with Spiderman PS4: the combat, skill points to get new abilities, the puzzle map system. Speaking of the puzzle map system is also fun. The puzzles aren’t anything too hard the worst they’re repetitive or they don’t really give you a clear idea on how to trigger them but still pretty fun and super rewarding when you do finally realize what to do and beat them up.I also like the music, Sonic games no matter the quality always have banger music and this game continues that trend…. At least when the music isn’t screaming at me. Listen Ik music is subjective and rock n roll isn’t that bad but who seriously finds this enjoyable?Show clip of me playing the song with my super realistic faceAnother pro is the camera. THANK GOD THE CAMERA DOESN’T SUCK. Any game can make it or break it for me if the camera controls aren't good. Super Mario 64’s camera controls give me nightmares. But Frontiers, not too shabby. And this is impressive considering how Sonic’s past camera controls usually sucked. Looking at you SA2 and Unleashed.Another pro is the boss battles. They’re more flashy over being hard but tbh I don’t mind this at all. I don’t mind when a boss can make you feel cool over a tough as nails boss and Super Sonic being included in all battles helps with making you feel super cooooool. At least as cool as you can be sitting on your couch with the laptop on your lap and holding an Xbox 360 controller. I’m so coolAnd that’s all the pros I can think of. Now onto the consThe ConsFirst thing first, while I like running around as Sonic, one problem I have is that it doesn’t feel like Sonic is equipped to run around in the world that he is placed in. He is constantly getting stuck over little things on the floor and it’s just annoying at times. Or how the collision can be a bit wonky, I’m talking full Sonic 06 at times. Another con is the momentum or lack there of itSonic fans have seemed to treat the word like it’s the plague but I feel like the lack of momentum was a huge missed opportunity on Sonic Team. Sonic basically controls like other platforms, has the normal yet slow speed and then has a run button. Yes, a Sonic game has a run button. And Ik that Lost World had it too but Lost World felt like that style warranted the button since the game was literally trying to copy Mario Galaxy. And another reason why Lost World’s use of it is better than Frontiers is the fact that Lost World’s run button doesn’t run out. The boost button being able to run out only really worked in the Boost games since that didn’t automatically fill up, u needed to do stuff like kill enemies to increase it. But here the button having a limit just makes it annoying especially since Sonic goes really slow when he isn’t using boost. And Ik that the leveling up system increases his speed but it’s still kinda lame. And the thing is that it could have worked. Sonic Speed Simulator on fricken Roblox has momentum and a leveling up system and while I agree that both systems are grindy at least Speed Simulator automatically increases u speed after each level instead of forcing you to run around and find one of the elden rocks to level yourself up.Another con is how the game flip flops between telling you exactly what to do and leaving you with nothing. In a minigame you’re told exactly what to do while in a boss battle it doesn’t even give you a hint at what to do. How was I supposed to know that I was suppose to use parry on these bombs? I don’t want the game to hold my hand the entire way through but at least idk show the bomb having a little effect which shows that you can parry them. Or maybe after dying a few times it tells you “try parrying” or something simple like that. It’s especially annoying when it tells you to go somewhere and then it has it be across an entire island forcing you to backtrack and figure out which platforming challenge in the sky you need to get to so it can take you to that island.Though these are more minor complaints, my main complaint is the cyberspace levelsNow let me say this right here, I am not a fan of the boost gamesSo maybe I’m a bit biased but my god are these just not fun. They pulled these from Forces which were pulled from Generations and there is little that was changed to accommodate Sonic's new playstyle. Try boosting, 9 times out 10 you’ll accidentally boost yourself off a platform and fall off into your death. I think a perfect example is how during the part in Sky Sanctuary where u go up a crumbling tower Sonic is no joke not fast enough to go up it in time, forcing you to boost which isn’t bad. But it is bad if god forbid you jump once or you accidently didn’t boost the exact moment you got on forcing you to fall.And because there is no momentum it makes other stages like Chemical Plant annoying to play.I don’t care that it’s nostalgia pandering, I care if it’s a good/fun stage which these aren’tAnd the worst part is that these are your main forms of getting the chaos emeralds. You need to play these and complete the mini missions to get the keys. Sometimes you’ll get one after killing a boss but most of the time these are how you’re getting them. So I literally can’t avoid thesePlus if you’re going to force me to play these at least give me more unique type levels. Not Green Hill, Chemical Plant, Sky Sanctuary, and generic Mission Street. No joke these are the only levels you’ll ever see and man they make me really hate Green HillDoesn’t help that these have fixed cameras making it harder to tell where you’re going or where you are in conciliation to the ground. WhoopieThis is also where I learned that…. the game doesn’t have brief invisibility when you get, they kinda have it in the open world part but it’s super fast so we have a Sonic 1 problem. Fun And that’s my complaints My Final ThoughtsOverall Sonic Frontiers is a good game. I feel like this game is a great blueprint of where to take Sonic in the future. While I do have some problems with this game these can and should be fixed in future entries, cut Sonic Team some slack this is their first open world game after all. And I feel like the most important thing about a game is if it’s fun to play and if it can keep you coming back. And considering how I’ve played this game for about 10+ hours as of right now over the course of a few days, yeah I think it’s doing this job correctly""]"

That may be partially because of nostalgia and not ""getting with the times,"" but what I\'ve observed is that newer sonic games lack the direction and the integrity that older games had. And no, I\'m not talking about the genesis games, they were archaic bare-bones platformers that most people only really like because they liked it when they were kids (not that that\'s a bad thing).\n\nThe adventure games, Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic 06 in a timeline where it\'s actually good, Colors, Unleashed (sort of?).\nThey had a charm that Forces certainly doesn\'t, and now Sonic Frontiers is lacking in as well.\n\nThe characters\' personality and voices have all been subdued, made background to the gameplay loop which would be a mistake even if the gameplay loop was good (which it arguably is not). Sacrificing the story and characters is not only pointless but has not contributed to any inalienable quality found in this game that wasn\'t present in the games previously listed under the category of ""the good ones."" Essentially we\'ve been forced to adapt from good story, mid game to bad story, mid game. That\'s not a tradeoff, it\'s a downgrade. Sonic sounds okay, I guess? But Tails and Amy are unrecognizable, especially Amy. And her dialogue has suffered too, losing any of the spice that came with her obsessive personality, now she\'s just one of sonic\'s friends with no distinguishing traits of any kind (other than she\'s the only girl, I guess?). Tails on the other hand seems to have completely reverted to Forces\' ""point-ass-at-threat-and-cry"" mode with weak dialogue and again: no real personality trait other than being friends with Sonic. Talis is an inventor, he made the Tornado, he is both useful and interesting...but not in this game. I have not yet seen any other cameos, but I\'d imagine they probably aren\'t much better, as they exist nowhere in the promotional art. Eggman is here, also weakened and frankly lacking in his comically exaggerated manner. His role in the plot seems to be mostly arbitrary here, not unlike Forces and the general trend away from the formulaic Sonic vs. Eggman plotlines (which can be a good thing, it\'s just not one here).\n\nThe gameplay, the thing that SONIC TEAM has supposedly mastered here, is only slightly better than forces, and is not better to an extent to excuse the black hole that is the plot and characters. Boost is back. I feel I need not say more but I will anyway. They ALMOST removed it in favor of the spin dash, but I guess that would\'ve been to difficult. There\'s now a maximum limit for rings in the free-roam """"""open world,"""""" set to 400 that can be upgraded as you play. The only problem is that reaching 400 rings stored (assuming you\'re not a complete bot) is incredibly easy and I did it in 10-15 minutes (and that\'s after being hit a few times). Rings after this limit are pointless, completely pointless. There is no score system in the hub world, and you don\'t gain XP for collecting rings past the limit, so ring hunting is truly useless since you will get the rings you need on your way and hit the cap for it anyway before you get the chance to upgrade.\n\nSERIOUSLY. It\'s not hard. The levels already do this and they\'re like a minute long. JUST REMOVE THE LIMIT FOR RINGS. IT IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE.\n\nThere\'s also a dumbass skill tree now? So you can unlock different moves as you play, which is stupid because Sonic has always had a high skill ceiling with basic mechanics that are given to you from day 1, level 1, meaning that beginners won\'t have to focus on unlocking moves they don\'t know how to use, and pros can use those expert level moves immediately instead of having to artificially wait?\n\nThat\'s what this game is, by the way: just a bunch of artificially waiting. Cutscenes that look less polished than gameplay, random and pointless grind rails and speed boosters to make you think you\'re playing a sonic game, boss intros for enemies I beat in 30 seconds, time spent in menus looking for the one thing the tutorial won\'t shut up about unlocking or changing, tutorial missions that are unskippable and require constant input for things you already know how to use demonstrably, LEARNING THINGS YOU\'VE ALREADY BEEN TAUGHT 3 TIMES.\n\nHey do you know how to homing attack? It\'s not jump anymore, silly! It\'s X.\nOh cool. Got it.\nHey do you know how to homing attack?\nYes, I\'ve been doing it for 15 minutes now I\'ve got-\nIt\'s not jump anymore, silly! It\'s X.\nYES I KNOW CAN YOU GET BACK TO THE GAME PLEASE?\n...\n...\nHey do you know-\n\nIt is simply a waste of time, like how that bit was a waste of review space. Maybe some of you reading this wish I didn\'t just take up 8 lines for that, like how I wish Sonic Frontiers didn\'t tell me how to perform basic elementary moves 3+ times. And of course, icing on the cake, the game does not look 2022 standards for a triple-A game, the controls are confusing and arbitrarily unintuitive, and worst of all: it seems barely finished and slapped together FNAF: Security Breach style. There are plenty of terrain bugs if you go looking for them.\n\nI have not played through it all, and I very well might. If my opinion changes, I will update and add addendum do my review. But as it stands, Sonic Frontiers is hollow, shallow, barely fun sometimes, and generally not worthy of being added to the ""good ones"" list. Plus it\'s 60 dollars, which is ridiculous.\n\n5/10. SEGA, if you\'re reading this, finish your game, and maybe for the next one try to move away from the hollow lifeless boost model that you seem so desperate to cling to for dear life.', ""THIS IS A LOOOOOONG REVIEW. I HAVE LISTED THE GAME'S PROS AND CONS AND GIVEN AN OBJEXTIVE SCORE BELOW FOR ANYONE SKIPPING THE SENTIMENTAL HOOBLAH.\n\nI still remember the very first game that got me into the world of gaming. I had played exactly 2 games before that game. Transformers: the game and the TMNT 2007 Game. I played those two when i was about 8 purely because of my love for the movies. Then, one day when i was out with a buddy, they kept telling me that they need to buy a game called Sonic Heroes. When we got to a DVD store, he practically forced me to buy and experience a Sonic game for myself. And i ended up with SADX. SADX made me love Sonic. I then HAD to play Sonic Heroes. Next, I HAD to play Sonic Riders. Then i HAD to get a PS2 so i could play Zero Gravity. Before i knew it, i had not only grown to love Sonic, but gaming in general.\n\n14 years later, I just played Sonic Frontiers. I am the biggest fan of Sonic, but i won't defend a game blindly. Forces was awful and i literally forgot about what even happens in it weeks after i finished it. Lost World was a painful attempt to enjoy but a failure to do so ultimately because of the horrible controls. Generations was my top pick for a long time, mainly because i always enjoyed the boost gameplay. Against all odds though, i had never played SA2, and i recently picked it up and played the hell out of it. I loved it. I became a fan of both Boost and SA style of Sonic. Then the classics. I never grew up with them, and always found it difficult to like them. I even enjoyed the 2.5D sections of modern games much less than the rest. But i kept playing Mania, and then realised that the game isnt about dashing through the fastest route on the first try, but enjoying the game as a platformer which you then learn the routes to make a mad dash for the goal. I now love classic Sonic too.\n\nComing into Frontiers, my expectations were a roller coaster. I was extremely hyped, but was apprehensive of it given the track record as of late. Preordered it nonetheless. Saw the reviews and got dissapointed. But went into it excited as ever. What awaited me was the one of the greatest experiences i have ever had with a game. There were moments in the game which i just couldn't even comprehend were real. It's very rare that a modern game manages to capture the magic of what makes gaming so surreal and takes you right back to your childhood. This one, fortunately, absolutely succeeds.\n\nIt's not a perfect game. Flaws Include:\n- Immovable camera during certain boss segments (it shows the indicator, so it's not a technical issue, it was designed that way)\n- running on the green glowing walls is not always accurate, and can send Sonic flying\n- dip in effort for the last island and final bosses and rapid pacing of story after 3rd island\n- clunky menus (ironically the menu to enhance Sonic's speed is the slowest one)\n- a bizarre boss fight near the end\n- very few puzzles. Especially the puzzle leading to the first boss.\n- Pop in. Noticeable, but does not affect gameplay. Did not bother me, but might bother others.\n\nPotential con/pro\n-/+ open world activities and puzzles (depends on whether you enjoy the open world activities and unlocking the map then moving on to the next one and so on. I absolutely loved it, and those giving positive reviews seems to have too. For those people, this is a surreal experience. For those that dont, it will get repetitive and annoying)\n-/+ Cyberspace levels. These are weirder this time around with a lot of variety. Mileage will vary\n-/+ Voice acting. Was jarring for me at first, but later was loving it because it feels on point with the more serious tone of the story. Feels like the characters have matured. Amy is my personal fav, she is an incredible character in this game and each interaction with Sonic and the rest of the gang is a joy.\n-/+ graphics. textures are not the best, but lighting is beautiful. Really gives the look of an abandoned island once populated by an ancient civilisation\n-/+ Barren lands. Again, this one is down to personal opinion. I think it works perfectly with the story. It does not make sense to have NPCs because these are abandoned islands. There are coco, enemies and main story characters everywhere, which do a pretty good job of filling things up. Other than that, i think that the feel and ambience of the islands are exactly how they should be. Besides, it does not pose to be noticeable when you are zipping around.\n\nPros:\n+ Soundtrack. Worth price of admission for this alone. Experiencing a boss unspoilt is the greatest gift anyone could ever give you. Every song with vocals somehow captures what is going through the mind of Sonic as a character in the game, Sonic as a gaming franchise, Sonic Team or any other character in that situation. We don't deserve this.\n+ Stunning meshing of all mechanics in every Sonic game prior to this. Classic gameplay? you got it. Adventure gameplay? you got it. Boost gameplay? you got it. Warehog combos that don't suck? you absolutely got it with a pinch of DMC. Lost world style platforming that doesnt suck? you got it. 2.5D? you got it. Fishing that is actually fun, relaxing and rewarding? you got it. Riding a board? It's just one level, but that is technically a yes.\n+ Clear mechanics. The game clearly establishes the mechanics that are available to the player, and these stick throughout bosses as well. If you have an ability, you can use it. The game also has a nice tutorial section that pops up near any encounter which let's you know what abilities can/need to be used. It is not forced, rather a button prompt - very handy. The loading screens also incorporate the tutorials, again a nice touch. There is only a single occurance of an unestablished mechanic popping up at the very end of the game in the form of a new type of QTE.\n+ Controls are an absolute joy, and this is the best modern Sonic has controlled\n+ Camera. They have put so much effort to making the camera great. I encountered very little problems with the camera. It is snappy and keeps up. Considering the speed of movement, it will always be difficult to have a perfect camera in an open environment for Sonic, as proven by some of the shortcomings of the adventure games. This is an extremely commendable job. They also have a static camera for segments of platforming, and this fixes into place very nicely and there is an indicator to let the player know when they cannot move the camera manually.\n+ Story and interactions. Absolutely amazing and surprisingly intimate story/interactions. A very memorable story on par with SA2.\n+ Moment to moment gameplay loop. With established mechanics and a great combo system, this is a joy to play.\n+ Atmosphere and ambience.\n+ Enemy designs. Some of the best i have seen in a Sonic game. It surprised me how they have managed to incorporate even some of the platforming mechanics into defeating specific enemies.\n+ Future DLC. Some free DLC has already dropped for the game. There is more planned along the way, which will also be free from what has been announced.\n\nThis game is not perfect in the sense that not everyone will enjoy what it has to offer. That is where the reviews come in. But if you are lucky, like me, you will get one of the best experiences of your life with this game. This was literally everything i wanted in a Sonic game. The embodiment of what Sonic is and always has been - fighting through the odds and always coming out on top. That has been true for his character in a given game and as a literal real life franchise. This game contains so many references and throwbacks to real life failures as well, it is just unreal. This is an underdog story, and i am here for it.\n\nObjectively, this game is a 7.5/10 considering everyone's perspective and the enjoyment they will get. But experience wise for those this was made for, absolute 11/10. Welcome back, Sonic!"", 'I often dont leave game reviews, but this is a time where its very warranted. I was obsessed with Sonic when I was a kid, it was one of my favorite series and I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ loved it. However I fell off kinda hard once Black Knight came out, which, I did play and had a lot of fun with it (even though its not good) afterwards I just kinda left Sonic behind for almost 12 full year, not even playing Generations until this year. I occasionally went back to the older games for nostalgias sake. But this game was very different, it really awoke pure nostalgia in me whenever they started to put out the trailers that werent utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It made me pick up the games I ended up missing, and it took me back to a very comfortable place in my life for a bit. Then when it finally came out, it was like Christmas with Sonic Games as a kid all over again. This game came out 2 days before my birthday, and honestly it couldn\'t have been more comforting and nostalgic to play even though with each day I feel old as ♥♥♥♥. Now unfortunately, this games not perfect, there is still a LOT of Sonic jank that seems to persist throughout the boost games and some less than stellar side content. Let me just get the bad stuff out of the way.\n\nThe Bad:\n1. The Cyberspace levels overall are just... kinda bland and dumb. Everyone knows at this point pretty much all of them derive from the older games, and almost none are original, and they LOOK bland because there\'s only 4 aesthetic styles: Green Hill, Sky Sanctuary, City Escape, and Chemical Plant. Those arent inherently bad but it really gets old by the third Island. I will give credit there are some distinct CS levels that arent actually based on boost game levels, like Radical Highway, White Jungle, and Sky Rail, which as someone who loves SA2s stage design to death, was refreshing to what Sonic has been for the last 15 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ years. Also, the physics in these levels SUCK. Unless they\'re the previously mentioned SA2 or select full 3D levels, the 2d ones suck, they suck so bad. The Physics do NOT feel right and the boost does ♥♥♥♥ all. It sucks. It honestly feels worse than Classic Sonic in Forces. The music is still pretty good as always at least.\n2. While the overall gameplay for the Open Zones is really good, man it SUCKS that Sonic still has to rely on boost to go fast. I honestly wish they would have let Sonic run as fast as he does in the Adventure Era.\n3. Everyone ♥♥♥♥♥ on it, everyone hates it, and I used to call it an unreasonable complaint, but man when you\'re playing it and collecting, it becomes very apparent. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Draw Distance. I dont care about it graphically, that doesnt bother me. What DOES bother me is Ill see some collectibles just floating in free air and you wonder ""How do I get that?"" And then you look around and nothing is there because of how short the draw distance is. I get that its a lot of props coming into play but at that point why would you not just build stuff like that INTO the environment? And lets not even get into the fact by the 3rd island 80% of those rail, platform, spring, etc. sections to collect tokens FORCE you into 2D and you CANT get out of it unless you go back. It breaks the pace of trying to run from Point A to B in Open Zone. Its dumb and gets old IMMEDIATELY. STOP HAVING SO MUCH 2D ♥♥♥♥ IN BOOST GAMES.\n4. They REALLY do not make some things in gameplay obvious. Like the parry. The dialogue box makes it feel like what you should be doing is pressing L&R bumpers when a hit is about to hit you which is an option but its really bad. What you SHOULD be doing is HOLDING L&R bumpers to parry. I did not figure this out until BEATING Boss 2 which is ALL PARRY BASED.\n5. As far as content as a whole goes, you can beat pretty much fully complete the game in 20 hrs. Everything. Thats not a bad thing, but for an Open World Style game, there should be at least a decent amount of stuff to do on the side or after main game. Once you beat the game the only thing you get is Arcade mode which is on the main title screen and its JUST the CS levels. Not even some of the minigames from the main story, which as far as Im aware, you can\'t go back and play them whenever you like. The minigames are kinda meh, they\'re not bad they\'re not great. Ones Pinball, and ones Ikaruga. In story they\'re annoying but it would have at least been cool to have them in the Arcade Mode.\n6. Combat while really well made, is kinda stiff when you have everything unlocked. And some are really annoying. Also they take EVERY opportunity to make sure you don\'t get to experience Phantom Rush for more than 3 seconds. Which sucks because Phantom Rush is one of the most satisfying parts of combat.\n7. They really hyped me up with the costumes from preorders, I thought thered be more but there\'s 3 total... classic, SA2 Shoes, and the Adventurer Items. There\'s one for Monster Hunter soon but... that\'s literally it. Why even go out of their way to advertise something like that if there\'s only 3 choices in the entire game?\n\nThe GOOD ♥♥♥♥:\n1. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this is the most fun I\'ve had for boost formula game play period. Again, while it sucks in CS, its AMAZING in Open Zone. This the first time since SA2 that I actually can feel Sonics speed. I still think SA1&2 style movement would have been better. But logically having a walking speed for doing puzzles and what not and Boost for covering ground is the right way to go. Also I found it really neat they implemented the Blue Electricity Speed from the movies. That ♥♥♥♥ dope.\n2. The performance on PC is actually so good! I\'m shocked. I only got 1 place in the game to chug at 1920x1440, 60fps, max settings. The only place where it suffers is cutscenes which seems to be a theme with Sonic PC ports ever since Generations. Not bad but just look grosser compared to gameplay.\n3. The controls are rock solid everything makes sense. My only complaint is man does the right trigger get abused like crazy for boosting.\n4. This game looks extremely pretty. I was worried it would look more Generic and only green, but, there\'s some genuinely pretty areas and ANY area with flora is chef\'s kiss.\n5. The open zone maps are the perfect size. The 1st map kinda teases you with half a damn map but overall it\'s perfect.\n6. The Music. ESPECIALLY BOSS MUSIC. Enough said.\n7. The Boss fights are the best in the 3D games, period. You can not change my mind.\n8. The writing is some of the best period. The last Sonic game to actually make me feel emotions was SA2. Black Knight\'s themes and messages were good, but is hard to take seriously because of the game itself. This however has it\'s own rules and themes and an actually COMPETENT writer. No line in this game made me actually cringe. At worst I felt indifferent. At best I was genuinely touched with character moments and development. E S P E C I A L L Y from Tails. They did Tails some well-deserved justice. They made Amy a very likable character and not an obsessed fangirl of Sonic. They made her an actual character and even tossed the idea of ""Hm, maybe I should go my own way a bit."" Which is a big theme in this game; finding your own path. Which ties into the gameplay therefore making an appropriate theme and not feel out of place. They also didnt make Knuckles a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ idiot again thank GOD. And even shockingly, EGGMAN has some moments where I genuinely got emotional and get to see a side of Eggman not seen since (like a broken record) SA2.\n9. I did not run into a single major glitch in the 20 hrs I played. Not one. Well ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ done Sonic Team.\n\nI cant recommend this game enough if youre a Sonic fan, or not even. Its just a very good game and its the best step in the right direction since Generations. Please support this game, we need more Sonic games like it, or even ones that will evolve into better games. Thanks Sega for a great B-Day gift, please make more like this.']"

While there\'s plenty of room for improvement, it manages to address issues the franchise has faced from Lost World onward, and shows newfound confidence and pride in the franchise.\n\nFrontiers is a very different game in the series. Rather than a linear action-platformer with a grading system for each stage (still present in Cyberspace), the game is split up into 4 open areas that Sonic must explore, in search of his captured friends. Once freed, your goal as Sonic is to search these zones for all 7 Chaos Emeralds, so Sonic can power up, transform into Super Sonic, and stand a fighting chance against the game\'s powerful new villain.\n\nCombat plays a large focus in this game. While some may bemoan the focus on battles instead of momentum-based gameplay for a more open Sonic game (which I would still like to see myself), quality of these battles is surprisingly high. Not only does Sonic have a plethora of attacks at his disposal by the time you\'ve unlocked all his skills, but the game encourages you to use each attack wisely, from using Cycloops to blow the shields off an enemy, to parrying attacks and projectiles back at a boss to then immediately punish them with a flurry of devastating blows. The combo meter, while not as nuanced as a Devil May Cry game, still has some perks of its own, as it encourages a more aggressive playstyle without getting hit to activate Sonic\'s Phantom Rush mode, in which attacks become much faster and more powerful. Enemy tells could use some work, but this game builds the foundation for something I never thought I wanted or needed in a Sonic game. Better yet, these mechanics result in the best Super Sonic segments the franchise has seen thus far (complete with bangin\' vocal tracks), which have bosses that test you on everything you\'ve learned, and throw a few curveballs at the player for a spectacle-filled hypefest. Sometimes these segments made me forget I\'m playing a real Sonic game, and not just imagining the coolest setpiece.\n\nFrontiers also features a fishing mini-game. In exchange for fishing tokens, Big The Cat will lend you his rod, to catch all the different fish in a pond and fill out the encyclopedia. Rather than the intrusive and controversial character-change it was in the first Sonic Adventure, fishing is now just a relaxing side-activity that can net you some bonuses to help you in your adventure, and I enjoyed it a lot while it lasts. The fishing mechanics are sadly lacking when compared to fishing mini-games in other series like Animal Crossing and Zelda (or hell, even Sonic Adventure), but the variety of catches, rewards on offer, and the Eggman voice logs made it a worthwhile break from the usual action of the game.\n\nThe story deserves equal praise, as it has the best writing since The Black Knight. No more Classic pandering, no more meta-humour in a desperate attempt to seem self-aware and smarter than the writers actually are, no more self-deprecation whilst hypocritically delivering a sub-par product, no more placating to an audience that never liked Sonic *cough* Normalboots *cough* Hidden Block *cough* Game Grumps *cough*, and no more trying please fans in the most cynical, surface-level way imaginable. No, this time, Takashi Izuka, who was impressed with Ian Flynn\'s work on the Sonic IDW comics, decided to hire HIM to write the script for the game. People were hyping this guy up like crazy, and now, I understand why. He\'s evidentally a huge fan of the franchise, with a good grasp on its history, characters, original lore and kanon (and not the vague, nebulous and overly-Americanised ""Mobius"" lore), and the developers\' original intentions with these characters. Hearing Dr Eggman acknowledge Sonic as coming from South Island might not mean anything to most people, but as a long-time fan of the franchise, who\'s had to watch this franchise lose its identity from Sonic 06 all the way up to Forces, it had me grinning from ear to ear. But that\'s not all.\n\nSonic The Hedgehog feels like Sonic The Hedgehog again. As in, the cool anime hero-inspired character who thrived in the 2000\'s, before being watered down into a caricature of his former self. Hell, all the returning characters feel like their old selves again, and even get some development and growth in this game. They acknowledge events from past games not as a cheap callback, but as a means of furthering their growth (or just a fun interaction between each other). Even the new character, Sage, has a great character arc she goes through, and Dr Eggman\'s voice logs are something any long-time Sonic fan will get a kick out of. We also get to learn about the origins of the Chaos Emeralds, and some interesting lore that ties back into past games in a meaningful way. See, this is what happens when you get fans of the franchise, who\'ve already proven themselves elsewhere, to work on the series, instead of a hack Saturday-morning-cartoon writer who doesn\'t even care about the source material.\n\nNow, none of this is to say the game is perfect. As great as it is, there are some issues that need addressing, and I can only hope this is the beginning of SEGA and Sonic Team\'s redemption where, instead of abandoning a good idea just because it didn\'t work out the first time round (or by association with a bad game), they learn from their mistakes and make an earnest effort to polish these ideas into something great.\n\nFirst, there\'s the Cyberspace levels. Doesn\'t matter what context it\'s in, and while some of them have unique layouts with interesting mechanics, enough is enough. We\'ve gone 11 years after Sonic Generation\'s release, and instead of moving on from what was only supposed to be a one-off anniversary idea, they continue to use nostalgia as a crutch. The controls are actually worse here than they are in the open zones, too, so that can result in some unwanted annoyance.\n\nAnother issue I had was the 2D segments, which were an unnecessary inclusion in Sonic Unleashed. They were supposed to be novel callbacks to the 2D Sonic games of old (even though the Rush games were still recent at the time). But in every 3D Sonic game after that, we\'ve had these perspective-shifts constantly shoehorned, even in the games that featured Classic and Modern Sonic as the dedicated 2D and 3D segments respectively (resulting in only a third of these games actually being 3D at all). Sonic Team already nailed 3D game design, on numerous occasions. They don\'t need to fall back on this outdated cliche anymore. If they so desperately want to make a 2D Sonic game, I don\'t see why they haven\'t commissioned a fully-original follow-up to Sonic Mania yet. I came here for a 3D Sonic game, and I expect it to be fully 3D.\n\nI wish 100% completion was more rewarding. Instead of a marathon of mediocre-to-okay Cyberspace levels, it\'d be cool if there was a boss-rush mode or the option to play as Tails and the others, with their own quirks and abilities.\n\nLastly, I\'m a bit disappointed we only got 4 zones. The adventure felt a bit too short, which I can cut some slack for being a more experimental game in the series, but I was having so much fun going through the game, looking forward to the last 2 zones, only to find out one of them is a short series of towers you have to scale, and the other has the final boss. I dunno if the 4th zone was unfinished and had to be repurposed, or if this was intentional.\n\nSonic Frontiers has plenty of room for improvement, but what\'s here is a good foundation to build upon. Judging the game by its own merits, it\'s a solid action-platformer with ambitious ideas, and pros that vastly outweigh the cons. It won\'t be a game for everyone, and that\'s fine. That\'s what Sonic\'s needed for years now. Rather than trying to please everyone, SEGA and Sonic Team have finally decided to focus on making a good Sonic game, operate within their limits, and take pride in their legacy again.', 'When I first started playing Sonic Frontiers, I wasn\'t sure what to think of it. The game just felt like a game, no impressions, positive nor negative, however when I played past the 3 hour mark I started getting into the addictive gameplay loop and enjoyed it a lot more. It isn\'t perfect, it should\'ve been delayed, but it is the best Sonic game we got in the past 10 years and finally a game that I would even recommend to non-Sonic fans.\n\nFirst, let\'s talk about the open-zone, which is a fancy word for a huge hub world you can explore. There are different islands to see. Traversal on these islands is a lot of fun, because, while it sounds like a gimmick, you simply go fast. Sonic feels really good to control, and it\'s simply fun to explore the islands at such a speed. Of course, there are a few things to do on these islands. You can do small parkours, challenges, beat enemies, minigames, fishing, or Cyberspace levels, which are the more linear levels. The game is a collectathon, so you get rewarded for most things with collectibles, meaning whatever you do, it is worthwile.\n\nOn these islands you find many rails and typical Sonic level elements. When you do them you go on a short trip that feels like a small level with additional alternate paths. These parkours are quite fun, and occasionally even better than the linear levels. It almost feels like a playground. Most of them are in 3D, but some are in 2D, and whenever you\'re doing the 2D ones you\'re stuck in the 2nd dimension, which breaks the pace for a bit, since if you don\'t wanna do them, you have to find a way out. I think the optimal solution would be a simple button to press to get back into the 3D space, luckily though, these 2D sections are mostly reserved for the third island. Furthermore, there are boost pads all over the place, and they\'re automating Sonic for a few seconds, which is questionable, because the point of the game is the freedom to walk around. Either Sonic Team should remove them, or make them go both ways, because at times it feels like you\'re fighting the game\'s mechanics. They should make the rails homing attackable instead, so the player initiates the parkours by choice, not by being thrown in there. It isn\'t a big annoyance, cause you always get rewarded, but it is unintuitive game design. Also, the parkours don\'t look nice, they just float and pop-in whenever they\'re needed, would be cooler to have it look more natural, like having a natural looping and so on.\nThere are also challenges which are really simple and easy, like doing a quick puzzle or having to go from A to B quick. Despite the lack of difficulty, I feel like they implemented them quite well, since you always keep going, never stopping. It felt like there was always something to do, no matter where you go.\n\nThen, there\'s combat. First of all, the enemy variety is vast, there are dozens upon dozens of enemies, and minibosses to fight, each being a little different. The combat itself is a bit more style over substance, meaning there are many animations, it\'s very flashy, and at times button mash-y. There are different attacks, which you do by pressing two buttons at the same time, but you can use most attacks whenever, which is a bit OP, since some attacks deal heavy damage with no build up. That is a bit odd, cause you sometimes end up doing attacks unintentionally. I think it should be fixed by rather starting a combo, by pressing X, for example, a few times, and then you can start dealing heavy damage. As it is now, combat is fun, but for heavier attacks there should be a risk & reward system.\n\nNow let\'s talk about Cyberspace. It\'s mediocre, if you never played Sonic it might be fun, but I really feel like it isn\'t great. Sonic\'s physics are altered during the levels, and he feels stiff, but also responsive at times, meaning a lack of consistency. His boost is a mere run button, it never fully depletes, which is odd, because the point of the boost is to keep it going by being good at the game. Sonic\'s moves are also a bit lacking. You don\'t have a short hop to keep your momentum, lightspeed dash doesn\'t keep your momentum either, you can\'t attack enemies from below, his homing attack is very slow and feels more like a combo starter without a combo, and the drop dash is poorly implemented. It\'s no use! It\'s the slowest movement option. Sonic overall feels painfully slow.\nThe levels themselves often feature level sections from older games, and they just make me feel like I wanna play the original level instead. It\'s good for newcomers, but it\'s noticeable when parts were made with different physics in mind. The very few original levels we do get are mostly fine, some are even good, but many have questionable level design where the easier paths are the fastest ones, or paths are just ordinary shortcuts.\nThere are also some small quality of life features missing, like when you pass a checkpoint I\'d like to know my previous time to find out if I\'m on a better pace than before, additionally dying before the first checkpoint doesn\'t reset your timer, and I would like to know when I\'m in control of Sonic during the beginning of each level, like Sonic Generations\' ""Ready? Go!"".\n\nStory-wise, the game is nothing groundbreaking. It answered a few questions, but it honestly answered less than I and many hoped for. They also wasted the climax of the story, which might be because the last half of the game was rushed. However, the writing is finally bearable. Sonic doesn\'t talk like a socially inept Reddit user who posts daily memes, and they actually gave Tails a short character arc, to address his mistreatment in the past games. For a non-Sonic fan it\'s nothing groundbreaking, but for a fan they finally nailed Sonic\'s character. The only issue I had with Sonic was him not even mentioning what happened at the ending, he was just like ""ok let\'s go home"" and moved on.\nDialogue is good too, but at times they simply let the characters run through an emotion for a second, leading to awkward silence.\n\nI think I should elaborate on the ""the last half of the game is a bit rushed"" statement.\nThe last two island don\'t have a lot going for them, they reuse the same assets, and they aren\'t anything great. They reuse a biome you already explored making it feel like mind numbing repitition, and the final boss, especially the secret final boss were rushed. They both are by far the weakest in the game.\n\nLast, but not least, the game\'s technical aspects arent great. Sometimes if Sonic walks on a small incline you\'ll be sent flying, some animations abruptly stop to put you in your default pose, and obviously the pop-in isn\'t great. Also, I heard of some people having performance issues, for me the game ran buttery smooth, but started having a few more issues when I played the fourth island.\n\nAnother thing I would like to add is a critique I already had for Sonic Origins, the missing leaderboards.\nIt\'s Sonic, showing off how fast you can go is a given, so obviously online leaderboards would be the way to go.\n\nSonic Frontiers has a lot of jank, pop-in and unpolish, especially the last island felt rushed, and it\'s a bit too easy. There are many issues, but most of them I pointed out are rather small nuisances that I just want to address, so Sonic Team hopefully won\'t do these mistakes again. This game lays a great and unique foundation for what could be the best 3D Sonic game. For the first time in my life I can actually say that I\'m looking forward to the future of Sonic. 7/10', ""Sonic Frontiers is a plainly good game in my opinion. Balanced out by great things and bad things.\n\nThe greatest aspect about it is the new format that breaks the mold of the old level format. Sonic can now freely move around huge worlds at his own pace. The movement in these open zones are awesome, responsive, and expressive. You can utilize Sonic's speed with his surroundings, rails, and bumpers to go to places with skill. Though sometimes as you run along the ground, the littlest piece of a rock or a steep ramp can send you flying, or straight down towards it like a magnet. This is sometimes annoying when you trying to cy-loop something at fast speeds.\n\nThe structure of the game's open zones starts at a high point in terms of quality. Exploring Kronos island (The first one) is a blast as you are brand new into the swing of things. Fighting the big guardians, collecting the memory tokens, puzzles to open up the map piece by piece, and entering cyberspace is a blast. When you arrive to the second island, it expands with WAY more scope, bigger guardians, and many ruins to dive into it. But by the the third island, the structure becomes stale and feels like a chore doing the same thing. The island themes don't help with this as they are based on realistic environments that sometimes blend together. I liked the fact that the 4th island is kinda of a different beast all together with it's story focus, but it's short lived. And by the 5th island, you doing the same things over again. You stop caring about fighting every guardian or collecting every token. I just wish they was more meaningful things to do on the island. It feels bare bones, the more you do it. This is by far the biggest issue for me with this game.\n\nWith that said, I do like the fact that they try to spice things up consistently trough out with small changes to puzzles, enemy variety, and some of the big platforming structures among the sky.\n\nCombat is okay at best. The highlight of combat is by far, fighting the guardians and titans. Each one have some unique little challenge to overcome. Though not all of the guardians are created equal, some of them are pretty lazy with QTEs and blandness just on par with a normal foe. The titans fights though is where it really shines. Each one has amazing high spirit pumping music, HUGE scale fights with a titans 100X bigger then you. It feels great overcoming these big foes. Though these fights are held down by the fact combat is pretty bland and easy to do. I played on the hard difficulty and dealing damage to these guys was pretty easy. Doesn't help that the parry does not require skill of timing at all and can be held down for a long time before you let go. Making the fights even more easy.\n\nSome of the unique abilities you acquire are fun to use against them. The highlight being the new cy-loop ability. By running around them and trapping them in you're trail, you can stun foes for combo starters. This move is also used for some puzzles which is alright. After fighting some of them you can also gain XP to unlock some more moves to help deal more damage in a combo which is alright. The skill tree is not big so you will get every move before the game ends.\n\nAlso scattered throughout the journey is some items that you can use to upgrade Sonic's damage, defense, ring count, and speed. Which is really nice, expect the fact that if you want to upgrade sonic's speed and ring count, you have to upgrade them one level at a time. It takes forever to upgrade these, compare to the damage and defense ones which takes all of the items at once and upgrades multiple levels at a time. Straight up took me an half in hour to upgrade my speed from lvl 53 to max. So annoying.\n\nCyberspace plays like more of a traditional sonic level. Point A to B, multiple pathways and such. The worst thing about them is that Sonic controls terribly in cyberspace, compared to the open zone. Turning around curvy turns is slow and wonky, you will bump into the wall or fall off. Also the fact that a majority of them use level designs from past game could be a great disappointment to those who would prefer something completely original. It also doesn't help that cyberspace has only four themes, which in turn makes them less memorable or something to not look forward to. With that said though, the best thing about cyberspace is the replayability. Exploring every unique route and finding the best ones to save time is a blast and is my personal highlight of the game. Racing for faster times is a joy (If you get use to the bad control of it like I did) It helps that the music in these cyberspace levels are great and have plenty variety to the sounds.\n\nThe story and characters are fine. The best thing about it is that it finally brings up the lore from past games and brings it up to speed with this one. No longer are modern sonic games feel like one shot stories, but instead, a mainline series. Character interactions between each other feels like real character that are true to the ones from 10-15 years ago. I really liked unlocking some of the side cut scenes to see how they played out. Though I do kinda wish Sage character was handled better. Her arc in this game is really slow, and you're conversations with her are always kinda the same. But she abruptly changes for the better around island three and doesn't feel earned at all. Though I do like the dynamic between her and Egg man in some cut scenes and the audio logs you can find by fishing. It really shows the bright side in egg man's character and the way in which he sees Sage is pretty cute.\n\nOne last thing I want to point out is that Big the Cat is back for this game. He brings a pretty chill, simple fishing mini game with him and is another personal highlight of mine. You can catch plenty of detailed fish and collect currency to buy in his shop. You can get pretty OP pretty easily thanks to big's shop. The music, the vibes, the simplicity is quite great with him. Please bring Big the Cat in more games please.\n\nOverall Sonic Frontiers shows a lot of promise for the future of the series. With a pretty fine addition of the open zones, mixed in with traditional levels, and lore from past games is great. I do hope they learn from the mistakes of this game to make the open zones a little more engaging and meaningful throughout. As well tightening up the challenge of the combat and adding originality to linear levels. Sonic has pretty solid foundation in the modern gaming space to succeed. Was this game a success? I want to say yes, but it's held down by ideas that could be better for a first attempt at this type of style. The passion of the developers does shine trough for me in some areas to make it worth it for me. If you are looking for an interesting and unique experience with Sonic, this is it. If you are on the fence on getting this game, it would be wise to wait for a sale if you are not feeling to sure.\n\nFine start really. Question is, how will they grow it?""]"

To start off, for some reason the game defaults to settings that limit your momentum so attempting certain maneuvers slow you down too much or just halt you completely. You can select preset setting to emphasize either Action Style or High Speed, I chose high speed but noticed that if I hit a boost pad and let go of my stick I almost immediate come to a halt. There is also a setting that was switched on that slows you down when you jump, so attempting to jump with any type of boost slows you down so you would miss a jump and land in a canyon or a stream of lava. Another thing I notice is that the drop dash has an issue on 2D stages. It works fine on a flat surface but if there's any incline you will lose all of your momentum or stop completely. It replaces the spin dash (which is unlockable) but I assume it would have the same issue of losing momentum on anything but a flat plain.\n\nA couple of the enemies were fun to fight but overall most were boring at best and tedious at worst. Some of the mini bosses that were tedious to handle were the Tank, the Fortress, and the Squid. The Tank would have you watch a cutscene every time it would bring you into the air and the floating attacks that you would have to do felt like trash to land, some of my attacks would put me through the Fortress and I would fall to the floor and have to redo the entire fight, and reaching the Squid took forever even with voltage speed. Sometimes after you're done attacking some of them during their vulnerable state, you would be left so far behind that it would take an entire minute or two just to catch back up to the point where they would start attacking you again. The main bosses also fall into the boring or tedious categories. The Giganto and The End have to be the most boring boss fights in the entire game. Giganto pretty much has you spamming your attack button while The End forces you into a bullet hell in which you can't do any damage for about 2 minutes before the sequence ends. During some of the boss fights I even ran into glitches that would force me to restart the whole fight such as necessary platforms not spawning in or sonic jumping backwards on rails.\n\nAll of the levels that are unique to Frontiers are horrible but the stages that were blatantly ripped from previous games were pretty fun such as level 2-6 which is a reskin of Sky Rail from Sonic Adventure 2 and 1-2 which is literally just Sky Sanctuary from Sonic Generations. The unique levels had no other ways to play them and were extremely straight forward which made them boring and forgettable. There was no thought put into the maps and no exploration needed to get an S rank or to collect the Red Rings. The overworld islands were also all boring past Ares Island. Whoever designed the process of unveiling the map really needs to be fired. You will do a small challenge and the map will be exposed in small, random blotches rather than a radius around the challenge point. The towers on Rhea island had me scratching myself due to their height and awful platforming.\n\nA small issue I have is that this version of sonic is really boring. I don't expect him to be all quips all the time, but there are many moments where Sonic and a lot of the other characters will just stay silent or smile at one another and it's just awkward dead air. Sonic also barely says anything during gameplay, sometimes he'll chuckle or stop by some ruins and comment on it but overall he just feel like a playable character here to move the story along rather than a fun character to be around like he's supposed to be.\n\nThe final thing I'll talk about is the fact that you can literally use Big The Cat to cheese your way through all of your upgrades. I went to a fishing spot for about 30 minutes and spent all of my tokens on Koco Children or upgrade seeds and got my speed/coin capacity to max level and my defense/attack to around level 60 or 70. I'm glad I didn't do all the grinding for speed levels because level 99 speed is just voltage speed. So reaching max rings just gets you to level 99 speed anyways. I also purchased most of the memory tokens from Big since I couldn't be bothered to play the game any more than I had to in order to complete the story. Another thing about the fishing is that it's on a set pattern rather than random pulls. Through my 30 minutes of fishing I went through the cycle about 2 or 3 times and noticed that all of the catches would repeat in the same order.\n\nTL;DR the game has momentum issues, boring or tedious enemies, easy access to max out all upgrades, many glitches that will have you restart boss fights, and sonic feels off.\n\n\n\ni came back to this review multiple times to edit in things i forgot about"", 'I really had an expectation to at least go out of this game thinking it was a good turning point for sonic, the game peaks 3 hours in and does the exact same thing it did in those 3 hours in a worse way for the next 15.\n\nBoost - Boost is still an over-centralizing mechanic and the game is worse for it as much as its been said. Boost attempts to fill in the gaps of bad level design by restoring your momentum constantly but not allowing you to really feel like youre a master of the momentum system in the game, because you dont need to be, to some people this isnt a big issue but a fast paced action platformer that barely rewards your momentum is awful game design, not because boost doesnt have any positives, but because the positives of boost can be obtained with better level design. Boost is a crutch the Sonic Team has leaned on for way too long and it is definitely the case here once again. Also, the springs not resetting your air boosts feels incredibly bad in some of the levels. So many of the bosses and mini bosses are designed so that you just hold boost at them for like 30 seconds - 3 minutes, no reward for good gameplay execution when the game expects you to already be going the maximum speed 24/7. This being said I don\'t even believe that boost is the worst part of this game, but a large contributing factor.\n\nOpen World - The open world felt hollow, the activities to do in the open world were easy and not very engaging at all, felt mostly like a time sink with no real depth to it. The game that comes to my mind the most in terms of such a throwaway open world design is Dragon Age: Inquisition, where so much of it is just meaningless gameplay fluff, but the awful part about this is that most of the game is this gameplay fluff, about 95% of it actually. The most unique thing Sonic: Frontiers open world did was add the Sonic The Hedgehog platforming to it, and its execution is neutered by boost and too heavily designed around it, also the inclusion of 2D sections is maddening because sometimes if you run into a boost mat(? dont remember what theyre called) or a spring it can force you into a 2d section where you are quite literally locked into it and forced to either complete this sequence (anywhere from 5 seconds to 1 minute) or break out of it by failing it to some capacity (going under a platform, missing a spring, etc). It is also worth saying that the 2D assets cannot be often targeted when in 3D as if they dont exist. Fishing with Big The Cat is a nice break but also feels like it is just sorta there to fill in the gaps for the flaws in the open world (good luck hitting 99 all stats just by being rewarded from the open world) that being said i did like the idea of it being an alternative to doing the open world content when i was getting tired of it.\n\nMovement - I\'d say the movement in this game feels okay at best and extremely awful in a lot of moments, some levels feel like they punish you randomly for not knowing whats going to happen off screen for doing the things the game has been teaching you to do the entire time, randomly punishing the habbits the game has taught you with some masochistic stage design. The best i got this game to feel was when i mastered spin dashing up a slope and getting Sonic to be in the trick state which is like the only way to keep momentum for a good while in the game. Lots of animation locking which feels like it removes a lot of fun execution that could be there. The second stage (1-2) taught me so much to get that S Rank just for the rest of the stages in the game to let me get S ranks with 10-45 seconds to spare on my first attempts. The tech that stage taught me mostly just helped me not get owned as much by the jank down the line and i was thankful for that (not a jank hater Sonic Adventure 2 is my favorite, mastering jank can be fun).\n\nStory - Definitely cheeks and feels like an afterthought on how theyd work in the open world design into a story which is just, restoring all ur friends by doing all the tasks in the open world and gathering memory tokens. The little rock fellas are super cute though shouts out to them they kept me going. Voice acting and dialogue was pretty whatever as well.\n\nBoss Fights - The first Super Sonic fight was a lot of fun to me and got me very hooked! I thought to myself ""if this is just the beginning im excited to see whats next"" unfortunately the fights following were just not that great, and because I decided i loooooove fishing with Big The Cat after the first area was cleared, I was one shotting most everything and while i could say that maybe you shouldn\'t level your power up so fast early, i feel like i would have preferred if the game stopped me cause... why wouldnt i see how far i can push the game early on for fun? Even though i was insanely overpowered early that didnt stop me from having to wait 1-3 minutes on very easy fights because they relied on making me hold boost for 3 minutes to be able to attack, some of them are okay and definitely cool to look at but didn\'t do anything for me gameplay wise.\n\nStages: - Stages in this game are mostly just references to old games with about 4 different themes, some of them were okay and kinda just let you get through them, some others really just arbitrarily punished habbits the game taught you for the sake of difficulty or whatever, in general there wasnt a single stage that felt like an ""iconic"" Sonic stage to me, very lazily put together and didnt reward you very much for any sort of mastery, didnt go back to any of them after getting the 4/4 completion. I hope we get more unique stages and new things instead of what feels like referencing old sonic material over and over and over. I could die happy never seeing the Green Hill Zone map theme again in my life.\n\nCombat - Starts off sorta fun, very quickly you\'re given abilities that are priority use over everything else save for a few situations, its very obvious. This wouldn\'t be that big of a deal and you could still have some free form fun if almost every fight in the game and smaller enemies included were Mechanic > Vulnerability Phase, basically not doing the easy optimal cyclone dashes or whatever they\'re called just means that you may be fighting some mini bosses for 5-8 minutes instead of 1-3, which after you do it the first time you definitely will not want to take it slow. The Immune Mechanic > Vulnerability phase gets tiring really easily, the parrying mechanic requires nothing out of you and the reward is very good often, you don\'t even have to time the parry you just have to hold it until you get hit as you can sit in the parry state infinitely. All the fights in the game degrade in quality as the stats and broken cutscene moves become more relevant.\n\nClosing Words - This game feels like it entirely just takes inspiration from other games better than it, and tries to execute what they have but fails in almost every single way. The positive response to this game has been very shocking to me but i was sold until after about the first 3-4 hours, after which the game took a massive dive in quality and its cracks started to show immediately and only get bigger and bigger. I was just passionate about a new Sonic game and getting to have it be the first game to break in my new PC! Hoping it would turn the series around for the better, and i think because of the reception of this game we are probably doomed to having generic open world sonic games for the next few years at least, i hope not.. but that will probably be the case. I was debating writing a review on this but I feel very strongly in the opposite direction of many people and want to make sure that maybe others who feel the way I do have a review to take a peak at that validates the idea that the love for this game may just be a giant psy-op. :3\n\nAlso sorry for the bad grammar but if you can digest this game you can digest this review x', 'Actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful, but it has a fishing mini-game so I am obligated to say it is good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR it\'s bad. Awful even, but the Sonic fanbase is in a Stockholm Syndrome love with it since it\'s… I was going to say a not terrible Sonic game but it\'s still pretty mediocre even by Sonic standards.\n\nThe movement is terrible. Sonic, even with his max ring boost, feels sluggish. He also stops on a dime the moment the controller goes into neutral even while boosting, which one could argue is for the new focus on platforming. This falls apart when you realize that the stomp has performed that function just fine in past games and would have done so here as well. Most of the time it feels like he is physically attached to the ground, god forbid you accidentally go off any ledge that isn\'t a 90 degree angle or you\'ll be boosting into a kill zone. Running on an open field? Don\'t worry you are sure to just trip over a random rock and get sent flying in a random direction, usually backwards. Or hit a boost pad or spring that will send you into a on-rails section that it locks you into and proceeds to send you off in some random direction. You might think to jump to avoid these things and retain your speed, but you lose almost all momentum while in the air even while boosting. The only time the movement feels slightly wieldy is the on-rails sections where the game plays itself for you with your only input being boost, switch rails, or homing attack. Even then I found myself transfering rails while boosting to only occasionally sent flying backwards. The homing attacks lock on is flighty as well, you would think changing it to only lock on to what is on the screen would make it easier, but it still struggles when there are two or more options to hit. For some reason they made it so your boost, double jump, and most bafflingly stomp are only refreshed on the ground or certain objects, so if you double jump before homing attack an enemy hope you didn\'t plan to do that again. Air boost into a spring? Well, I hope you don\'t need to do that again. Want to use the Stomp for some precision landings in the line of vertical launch rings? Get ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nNext is the combat. It is slow and overly showy. I want to blast through basic enemies at sonic speeds, not homing attack them once and go through a whole combo while using unwieldy special attacks. When I see a big ass overworld boss that I have to run up the side of to hit their weak point I want to homing attack it once, get knocked off and run up again for the other two. Not go through a whole song and dance routine for all 3 of them. I can accept it during the boss battles, but half of those boil down to waiting to use the parry, then mashing once they hit you. Oh yeah, parrying is brain dead too, it isn\'t timing based like you\'d think. Just hold it down and you are basically invincible for an attack before you get slow-mo and either rush in for the kill or hold it down if the game decides that\'s not how you beat this specific enemy so you better not get any ideas. My favorite move is the homing shot, which uses boost and homing attack so better hope you don\'t need to use the homing attack after boosting or you\'ll find that 9 times out of 10 you\'ll be left sitting in the air over a pit while your homing attack target dies and you no longer have a target to homing attack to.\n\nThe overworld and levels themselves are garbage as well. We all heard the joke ""SEGA actually hired the Nintendo-Hire-This-Man"" but it exists for a reason. Everything in the overworld looks like a basic unity asset flip with Sonic looking completely out of place. The only place this isn\'t the case is the levels but 3 of the 4 level archetypes are just a Generations asset flip, with the sole exception being the vaguely generic looking city levels. In lore it was described that the reason the levels were like that was because they were going through Sonic\'s memories, but I guess, like SEGA, Sonic can only remember Green Hill, Chemical Plant, and Sky Sanctuary. While only vaguely remembering what I think is supposed to be City Escape? Speaking of these levels it\'s not only the assets that are flipped but the level design as well. If you\'ve played past Sonic games you\'ll probably recognize various layouts from Adventure 2, Unleashed, and most prominently Generations. They have a different coat of paint but they are still recognizable in a 15-year old making a Sonic OC from a template sort of way. Unfortunately the levels they don\'t outright lift from other games tend to be absolutely no fun at all.\n\nI guess everything else is just the smaller nitpicking stuff that slowly built up to crush my enjoyment. I hated the upgrade system, at least half of it. The defense and offense fruits weren\'t that bad, but the Korok- I mean Kocos that blend in with the gray rocky terrain and buildings are a pain to find. It is even more painful to turn the Kocos in for your speed and ring upgrades. For the fruits all you need to do is go to the guy, turn in all the fruits at once, and get all your levels all at once. The Kocos? You have to individually level up one at a time in a menu that delays itself by a second before it will let you interact with it. It took me 30+ minutes of nothing but this menu to get to max speed and the best part I still felt slow after getting all the Kocos I needed from fishing. Menuing in this game overall is terrible especially for ♥♥♥♥ you want to just do fast, like resetting levels or fast traveling. Oh hey, you unlocked and completed that level and you think that would give you a fast travel spot? What are you stupid? Complete all the poorly aped challenges/puzzles to get the whole map view and then we\'ll unlock all the level statues as quick travel whether you ever touched them or not. Oh you\'re clicking on the fast travel point to go there? Sorry you need to switch to the fast travel tab you idiot. I mentioned it earlier, but the puzzles all feel like poorly aped versions of Breath of the Wild puzzles copy-pasted across the map. My favorite puzzles were the night time only puzzles, where you might think ""oh maybe it will have to be night to do a puzzle related to the moon and the stars, maybe a puzzle that has to do with light and darkness"" if you were playing a good game. No, it\'s the same glowing spots that only appear at night because SEGA wants to waste your time. ""Oh, so I\'ll just use the pass time function that all competent games with day-night cycles have to get it done now"" you might say, but no. There is no quick time passing, so if you are left with only one ""puzzle"" left you just have to sit there for about 10 minutes afk waiting for night to fall. Special shout out to my two favorite enemies, the one that takes control of the camera to fly away leaving a balloon trail for you to go up and kill it when I just want to pass by, and the group of robot wolfs that if you get too close to will circle in a trap that you can\'t jump out of as they one by one come out for you to slowly counter before you can leave.\n\nThe good things?\n-The fishing minigame is simple but fun and it also gives you pretty much all the collectibles. You could ignore basically everything besides purple coins and the star shower event that gives you more purple coins to do more fishing and just unlock everything with Big.\n-The interactions between Sonic and his Friends are pretty nice, a lot of nice character interactions and development that I\'m sure will be disregarded immediately as soon as a new game comes out.\n-Shadow the Hedgehog (the game) was made canon by a Eggman log you get from fishing.']"

Alternatively someone can go all-in on the cyberspace levels without needing to interact much with fishing if they absolutely cannot stand fishing.\n*Character development is surprisingly better than normal, there\'s hardly anything here that comes off as super cheesy or off-base like in most games.\n*The way Sonic grows stronger as you play longer, level up more, and learn new fighting skills ends up being really satisifying.\n*I personally loved being able to traverse the land better as I got more familiar with the controls and did some things I thought were cool that may not necessarily have been intentional.\n\nCons:\n*Difficulty imbalance: 1-2 is notoriously ridiculous as a Cyberspace level to get S rank time on for example, but then you\'ll do 1-3 and it\'s piss easy maybe even on the first try. Then once in a while you\'ll have mandatory mini game bits that completely halt the game(and required to progress) and can either be super irritating or legit challenging.\n*A lot of exploration bits to open up the map are so mind-numbingly easy that they sometimes fall into ""Hold boost and just wait"" or ""baby\'s first Simon Says"". There\'s a ton of them and it\'s way padded out to what feels like inflate game time.\n*There are some issues I would consider in need of QoL polish. Every single time you finish one of these exploration bits, every time you come back from a portal level, you either skip 2-3 cutscenes or have to sit and wait for 20 seconds to be able to move again after a simple moment. Whoever designed it so you can only upgrade rings and speed 1 at a time vs ATK and DEF all at once, PLZ\n*Pop in is obviously a bit strange, I am not sure if they did that due to hardware limitations or so that one would need to more thoroughly explore every nook and cranny of a map. It will take some time to learn the layout of a land on the first go.\n*To fully understand the final boss, you have to know what the game director said in a game interview regarding the final boss.\n\nThis game kind of reminds me of a ""SEGA HIRE THIS MAN"" type of fan project which is kind of weird given this is a real Sonic Team game. The idea crossed my mind while playing on occasion, but I don\'t think this is a completely bad thing because for how many times I\'ve seen people say they wanted something like that kind of game, this is kind of it. I\'m sure people would expect a higher standard than ""fan project"", but this is the first time they\'ve done anything this radically different. It isn\'t perfect because of some of the unnecessary feeling of padding but to me personally the good was enough to outweigh the annoying parts.\n\n\n09/01/2023 Edit: Now that the game has been updated with the Final Horizons update, I would still recommend this game on any kind of sale. This game definitely isn\'t going to be for everyone, but I still had fun with it. It\'s a bit rough around the edges at full price, so I would advise waiting for a small discount.', 'Easy recommend, for multiple reasons. It has faults though. Also I don\'t exactly shy from spoilers here but I don\'t just reveal the whole plot either.\n\nLet\'s start with the faults. The game isn\'t exactly that clear on what you\'re supposed to do early on, which consequentially makes the first island my least favorite. There\'s a ton you can do almost immediately and there\'s very little insight on what actually progresses you aside from the very obvious things you need to do.\n\nCyberspace is bad. Control wise at least. These are the ""regular"" Sonic stages for the game and they follow the boost formula we\'ve had since 2008. This is definitely the worst boost Sonic has felt ever though, and that\'s including Forces. Everything else about Cyberspace is good though, music is superb, graphics are on point, level design is mostly rehashing past design, but it\'s rehashing design that hasn\'t been rehashed before so I\'m kind of okay with it. The requirements to S rank are also not too bad either, save for the very first 2.\n\nThe ""open zone"" is where this game shines and clearly where all the effort went. The islands are pretty big, and there are 5 of them, but they also kind of feel bland. There are multiple biomes but the first biome gets reused for the final two islands so it feels like there\'s less to explore overall. Exploring is fun though, you really feel like Sonic or the Flash running around at such high speeds. Cyloop is also cool as a way to interact with the world and I do hope it returns.\n\nThis game is tied with Generations for me as my favorite though, and that is for two primary reasons. The story and the bosses. So, starting with the bosses, they are all Super Sonic fights. This seems like it would be repetitive, but honestly I lived for these fights after experiencing that first one. I could not put the game down because I wanted to play the next boss and I wanted the story to progress. These are the most hype Super Sonic fights in this franchise\'s entire history. They have moved the bar for Super Sonic fights so much higher that I fear they won\'t reach it again. The music, the speed of the action, the cinematics, the finishers. It\'s all beautiful. Plus for me seeing Super Sonic actually talk to people right after is fun, since he normally doesn\'t.\n\nFinally, the story. I\'m gonna try not to spoil things, but it\'s definitely written by a fan of the series, specifically a fan that wants the overall lore to move forward. Ian Flynn, the writer for the comics, wrote the dialogue for this game and it makes every character so much more likable than any previous game. This is my favorite story in the franchise. It also seems like they took Sonic twitter saying ""everything is canon"" literally, but it feels cohesive. They reference past games and shows a lot, which I thought wouldn\'t feel right given how wildly the world in this franchise has changed just between each game, but it feels natural. I can believe this Sonic is the same Sonic that took down Dark Gaia or Chaos or the Deadly Six. It actually makes me angry about the writing for Generations. If we had this team writing for Generations, I feel like the lore of the series would be in an extremely different spot today.\n\nEither way, this game puts Sonic in a great spot and I hope Sega doesn\'t mess it up. I do think $60 is slightly too high for it. Maybe wait for a sale or price drop, but I wouldn\'t feel bad buying it at like $50. Like I said at the beginning, easy recommend.\n\nEdit: With mods this game is amazing. Recommend the ""Showin\'s Momentum Tweaks"" mod to make the open world more fun to traverse.\n\nEdit 2: With the 3 major content updates this becomes an entirely different beast. This is peak Sonic the Hedgehog, and officially my favorite Sonic game of all time.']"

If you have the chance, definitely get this game if it\'s on sale, but even if it isn\'t I wouldn\'t say it would be a regretful purchase.', 'To be honest, I kinda\' regret buying this game. Don\'t get me wrong, it is the BEST Sonic game in recent memory. The world is interesting and beautiful, the plot is alright, gameplay is pretty good. I\'d give it an 7.5-8/10.

I played through the story, got the secret ending by playing on the highest difficulty, and did pretty much everything I deemed ""Worth doing"", There\'s just not enough here to justify a 60$ price-point.

The story is something we haven't seen in a sonic game be this serious in such a long time, the characters actually have character! (no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ way) and the voice acting is actually pretty damn good. Gameplay wise this is nothing short of a blast to play. If you're a fan of the 3D sonic games such as Generations, Unleashed, and Colors, this game takes the good and makes it better. I won't go into spoiler territory but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game has the best soundtrack that I've ever heard from a game in years! if you like Devil May Cry, Metal Gear Rising or any other game that pumps out thunderous metal tracks while you fight then this is the game for you. The open world is massive yet not overwhelming at the same time, giving players an easy time figuring out the layout of the map while giving you plenty of room to boost around and practice your free running. Hunting down items never feels tedious but instead feels innovative and clever, having to figure out how to get from point A to point B in the most efficient way possible to collect all the little trinkets and doo-dads that are sprinkled around the map. The combat feels fluid and fun to control, however not perfect. I've experienced a couple little bugs but it's honestly not a big deal in the grand scheme of things. So yeah, if you're a bit on the fence with this game and weren't 100% sure if you wanted to commit, I so strongly recommend this game especially if you're a Sonic fan (AHEM and a fan of Metal tracks in your video games) Sonic is back!!!"", ""An amazing step in the right direction. While not everything is perfect, it gets a lot of things right and pushes Sonic in a much needed new direction.\n\nPros:\n- Amazing fluidity in the open world when it comes to movement and level design.\n- Inspired level design within the Cyber Space levels. Short and sweet, but the multi challenges allow for multiple playthroughs to get a 100% completion rank. Also nice call backs to previous Sonic levels.\n- Curiosity is rewarded pretty heavily. One puzzle leads to the next very nicely. I found myself sidetracked heading to destinations.\n- The story and vocal direction are truly top tier for the series in recent memory. Keep Ian Flynn, SEGA. PLEASE.\n- The music is a HUGE step up from past titles. Bringing in new genres as well as perfecting others not so new to the series.\n- The boss fights, while a bit clunky sometimes, are just too rad to be mad at. Some of the best in the series. Also pretty nice to see Super Sonic more often than just at the end of a game.\n- The mini-games + fishing are SO refreshing. Love me some Big.\n\nCons:\n- While the realistic scenery was a nice change of pace, the themes for each island don't vary much. I never found myself super excited about being on any of the islands, though the atmosphere was nice at times.\n- While Sonic controls amazing in the open world, the Cyber Space version ends up feeling a tad sluggish, but more so stiff in the 3D sections. The great level design helps the flow, and 2D sections feel pretty good, I found some frustration when turning or moving in certain sections.\n- Some inconsistency within the RPG elements. While leveling up ATK/DEF was fluid and instant, you have to manually upgrade speed and ring count one by one. It takes, no kidding, probably close to 30 minutes overall or more to upgrade both to max if you have all the resources. The skill tree is basic, while very cool for a first attempt, ends up having some issues with combat fluidity. Feels good but could def use improvement. Not to mention the fact I was able to max it out about 4 hours in outside of the story skills you get. Skills points then stack up with no function after that. Among small other inconsistencies, the RPG elements are a welcome addition, just fairly clunky in it's approach.\n- While the story and lore are amazing, it ends up feeling like it just ends, even with the hard mode ending. Still an incredible story, I just wish there was more.\n- Currently no NEW GAME+ option or anything extra for 100% completion. Bosses are also locked out and require a new game to revisit them again.\n\nBonus Points:\n- Arcade Mode was an awesome touch.\n- They could've charged for the SOAP Shoes DLC, but were free with a news letter sub. Wish Sonic kept them in his design because they look SO much better on Modern Sonic than his default classic kicks.\n\n- - - - -\n\nOverall, an amazing first attempt at a new formula. Would def recommend, especially to Adventure era fans."", ""I have a lot of thoughts about this game and most of them are positive! For your average player, this game is pretty good! It has it's issues: pop-in, cutscene jank, and a little bit too heavy on the item collection, but for most Sonic fans this is the resurgence that we needed:\n\n- The speeds you can reach make this game so satisfying and I really enjoyed flying through the air when I jumped off a rail or flew off the terrain at the right angle. There's a real sense of freedom here.\n- The music is phenomenal and is one of my favourite Sonic OSTs to date - I even got goosebumps listening to some of these tracks for the first time.\n- The bossfights and even the minibosses/guardians are so much fun to play - some of which I'd consider the best we've ever had in the series.\n- It seems like they finally care about series continuity and character development again (please Ian Flynn stick around for future projects!).\n- Fishing minigame with lo-fi, need I say more?\n\nMost of all, they're willing to mix up the formula to give the Sonic fans a fresh experience. I can't stress enough that I want to see them continue forward in this direction, maybe making stages more like the open-zone levels and finally figuring out a way to drop the necessity for 2D sections in a 3D game.\n\nWith that being said, . They've created a formula that works, now they need to refine it.\n\nFor Sonic fans, buy this and I'm sure you won't regret it, especially if you enjoy the storytelling of the Adventure era to Unleashed. Anyone else scrolling by who's interested, maybe pick it up on sale or when there's a price drop if you're feeling a little hesitant? I strongly recommend this regardless, great work overall Sonic Team!""]"

If there's any series that should embrace high framerate/refresh rate as part of the intended experience, it's Sonic. But no, 60 fps cap and no ultrawide support either, and it would keep resetting resolution. Very basic settings in general. No voice audio unless you enable Windows Sonic for Headphones. I figure there isn't any patching effort going on at this late date post-release either if it's still in this state.\n\nI wanted to go with this version over consoles because the Switch seemingly made every console version have constant super bad LOD pop-in everywhere, but even with max LOD modding on PC here you still see it sometimes. It's weird playing a Sonic game that is so much about puzzles, and it's very blatantly derivative of Breath of the Wild, but there are some ideas with potential here and Sonic hasn't really tried expanding its scope in a long, long time, so I respect that this one was trying something different, but it just feels like a less tedious Sonic '06 with some good music that puts you in a reflective mood. Unfortunately, my reflections have led me to the conclusion that I'm just not gonna click with this game and I should get my $28 back. Hoping that the inevitable Frontiers 2 is a more proper PC release and sorts out the jank."", ""If you wish to watch my full coverage of the game. You can watch them here:\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4qRm56odipG6TFdepa_vnxSgjmeLwej9\n\n\nReceived this game via Fanatical sales which was discounted and coupon to further make it affordable for the Deluxe Edition. Paid about under $38 for it. Regular MSRP about over $61.59 pre/launch price of the Deluxe.\n\nBeing a Early player to the title can have its benefits/cons.\n\nOn one hand. You get to play the game on Launch and subsequent days if you dabble on the game on and off to broadcast it to hardly anyone to watch you. As typical to most content creators that do gameplay coverage (heh) experiencing the game at your leisure with hardly any outside interference or spoilers.\n\nOn the other. The game is in a slight buggy mess which can cause crashes and issues if your PC is low Spec (Such as my toaster with the NVIDIA 780 )\n\nIf I were to be blunt about this, SEGA and SUPERFANS (People who are Content Creators that are given Pre-Launch Coverage Keys to broadcast it) somewhat spoiled a bit too much on Social Media in hyping the game so some magic were gone in diving into the game without any surprises past the 2nd boss. The game was trending so much on Twitter and feeds that alot of the game Early and Middle got spoiled and revealed to generate hype for the title.\n\nWhile it worked and people are now playing it, myself included. I wished I went into the game without *ANY* knowledge of what's to come within the game.\n\nAnyways under 23 Hours of play (with an additional 1+ Hour of checking out the Deluxe Edition extras with the Mini Soundtrack and goodies) I was able to enjoy the game throughout regardless of the spoilers that were shown in Social Media despite the Filters being set up and constantly people sharing information of the game.\n\nStrengths: A bit more exposition of lore behind the precursors of beings referenced in Sonic 3 and Knuckles and Sonic Adventure. The first one. Not the Second.\n\nNew Character: Sage the Artificial Girl- She is somewhat better than Infinite at *least* on giving a story guideline to push the story across. Actually feels like she belongs in the story and had a presence all throughout. She doesn't do much aside from that until the *Very End* for the most part she is the Story Giver to give the player/Sonic/Cast explanation of what is going on in the Star Fall Islands\n\nThe Ancients/The Precursors/The Koco/The Beings before all else inhabiting Sonic's World are revealed as teased from previous games *Loosely from Sonic Boom too*, if you do pick this game up and plan to play through it. You will be treated with a nice exposition of what became of them and how the regions of Starfall Islands are to be as it were.\n\n\nThe Bad: Elder & Hermit Koco- aside from updating Sonic in his specs, they offer no additional story-lore aside from 1 cutscene near the beginning. Plus, updating Sonics' skills can be somewhat tedius if you are swapping Ring for Speed and Vice Versa. The Devs set it up that you have to repeatedly click the menu multiple times instead of setting a amount to transfer.\n\nThe Story: There is much left to be desired about the lore regarding Sonic's world and the inhabitants before Sonic and friends existence. As I said before. Sonic Adventure, Sonic 3 and Knuckles and a few other titles before hand were referenced all throughout the game between the cast of Sonic and friends. More questions rather than answers were given throughout and regardless of some reveals within the game and its plot.\nIt somewhat falls short? Especially at the end.\n\nThere are 5 Islands of Starfall Islands: Kronos, Ares, Chaos, Rhea, and Ouranos. Each of the 5 is named after the Ancients. You might find that Chaos and Sonic has alot in common upon retrospect.\n\nEach region is relatively well spread out with paths opening up the more you run through and solve puzzles throughout. Plenty of things to grab along the way to help you progress through the story.\n\nI aim to play the game again in the future via PS4 with Remote Play and I hope that I won't encounter crashes/bugs as I have in the PC port.\n\nIts serviceable to say the least. The music as usual sets the mood and pacing. Especially in the Titan Fights. Its an improvement over Sonic Forces that's for sure.\n\nBut if Sega wishes to expand upon Sonic's world and it's characters.\n\nIts about time Sonic and his friends go their separate ways and find their own paths through life.\n\n\nOverall. I enjoyed it. You should too.\n\nOpen World Games are often more Fetch Questy and such but thanks to Sonic's speed and quick traveling. It wasn't mundane."", 'Product refunded\n\nBeing a Sonic fan since I can remember, after losing touch with the franchise after the disaster that Sonic Forces, and the later disappointment that the Sonic Colors ""Remaster"" were, I was willing to give Sonic Frontiers a chance as it released on Steam today, and after seeing the raving reviews all over, I rushed to the wallet and bought it.\n\nAfter opening the menu imagine my disappointment when I was greeted by your standard mediocre console port with low quality textures, no ultrawide support, 60 fps cap, which might seem like a petty thing to complain about, but at the AAA price of 60€ for the standard edition, and 70€ for the Deluxe edition is definitely worth pointing out and a troubling first impression.\n\nThe game opens with a low resolution, in-engine cutscene with lighting and shading issues, and a really weird antialiasing effect during rain which makes the game look like something straight out of 2008, or some fanmade SFM low quality animation over on Youtube.\n\nSo I\'m here in the first stage, running with no previous control tutorials or popup messages to get the hang of the game.\nOff to the Settings to increase the camera sensitivity and still feeling the max setting not being enough for how slow Sonic handles.\nYou would think the game would play like previous Boost games à la Unleashed, Generations or Colors, but unlike in those games, Sonic feels slow even on the ""high-speed"" setting compared to previous games, and even other fanmade Sonic games. I know there is a speed stat which will probably be later upgradable to make this more bearable, but the base max speed feels terrible from the get-go and makes me wonder why there is a max speed setting available.\n\nSonic can fight in this game, with fists and kicks mostly, and a decent collection of combos and skills to make the combat feel deeper through a skill tree system. It is an expansion on the combat from previous 3d Sonic titles, which would stick to homing attacks and spin dashes in order to deal with enemies.\n\nThe story feels interesting and a continuation of the pre-release trailers but is immediately obliterated by the open-world gameplay with a disconnected, seemingly random amalgamation of springs, rails and platforms floating in the air with no attempts at suspension of disbelief, which would make you think there is some weird rendering issue with the game not loading the level to hold these elements, but is actually the intended effect.\n\nUnlike the previous games, which would consist of various straight levels with additional shortcuts where you had to go as fast as you could to beat the clock, Sonic Frontiers is an open world game, and open means OPEN.\nYou are barely given the base moveset when the game decides to drop you in the middle of the map, with a vague indication to complete mini-games scattered all over, in order to get the keys required to unlock the straight high-speed sections.\nThese sections are really short, and they really feel more like mini-games than in earlier titles, which is kind of a disappointment, as day levels were the highlight for me in Sonic Unleashed or Generations.\n\nThe bosses are the main spotlight in this game for me, with the combat playing well with the movement mechanics, and ingenious weakspots and phases.\n\nThe music has always been great in Sonic games, and it\'s no exception in this one, where it ranges from soothing lo-fi themes to straight up bangers, killed by either the terrible boost echo filter, or the obnoxious sounds that range from earrape springs to loud rails to the pick-up sound of purple coins, pink hearts, red beans, blue beans, kocos, blue exper- WHY ARE THERE SO MANY CURRENCIES.\n\nAll of this combined makes the game feel more like a tech demo than a full-fledged, AAA release which baffles me when I see the other reviews screaming praise and making the game look like a return to shape for Sonic, when it comes across as exactly the opposite to me.\n\nFar from sounding like a contrarian, this is NOT the Sonic I fell in love with.\nThe franchise has been heavily experimental for years, with Sonic Team always trying new concepts and gameplay designs.\nI have played every Sonic game, and in every one of them (yes, even \'06, incredible I know) I have found something endearing or created with the intention to have FUN, to try to make a game out of anything you can think of: DS platformers, racing hoverboards, RPGs, exploration...\nBut Frontiers feels like a desperate attempt at adapting to the new and trying to bring Sonic to an open world, and failing at it because floating rails and 10 different currencies to collect are not what Sonic has been about, and it feels wrong.\n\nProbably buy during sales, or full price if you want to support the developers, but I don\'t feel like this is a Sonic game worth 60€.']"

However, this is one of the most enjoyable open world platform games I have played in awhile.

However, this game came as an amazing surprise. We FINALLY have a good sonic game. A few of the key points where this game shines are as follows.\n\nThe cutscenes and open world environment are beautifully crafted.\nThere is genuine character development.\nThe combat feels organic and well designed.\nCollecting items across the area for story progression felt mostly organic (which I find is hard to pull off).\nEnemies felt well designed aesthetically and mechanically (mini-bosses are actually fun).\nAbility tree\n\nHowever, it would be unfair of me not to point out some of the flaws I came across whilst playing this game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI do think this is an amazing sonic game. The best one since 2003. However, there is no such thing as a flawless game. This is definitely a good base, however a few things should be polished up with any following game. Without a doubt though. I would recommend this game.', ""(Spoiler Free, TLDR at the end) After 35h and 100% the game here's what I think:\n\nFirst thing to know is, even though it wasn't marketed as one, this game is a collectathon, if you go into it expecting something else, you might be disappointed (my case).\n\nIs this a good Sonic game? Absolutely. Is it a good Action/Adventure Open-World game? Not really.\nDon't get me wrong, it's fun, but after the first 10h it'll stop being fun to being EXTREMELY repetitive.\nThe story isn't bad, it has a mature feel to it, which I like, but the actual story sequences and cutscenes are very few and far between, the soundtrack is also really good.\n\nThe areas are pretty (although very simple, except for a couple landmarks there's not really anything to write home about), but very empty, there's only some small courses for short platforming sections, items to collect and enemies (which have a decent variety to them to be fair), the game tries to justify this emptiness with some lore but it's really just an excuse, the courses don't feel organic to the areas at all, it's clear they were placed there in a very arbitrary way.\n\nThere's also the issue with the Pop-Ups, a lot of time these courses and platforms won't even load until you're right in front of them, which for a game about going fast is a big issue.\n\nThe controls feel very good (played with controller) I recommend playing on High-Speed mode with all the speed settings turned up. The combat is fun enough, specially the bosses, which contain some fun mechanics to defeat them.\n\nAll of this sounds like I hated the game, but the truth is that it has some charm, and clearly does something right If It kept me engaged for 35h and made feel like I wanted to 100% it.\nBut it is absolutely not worth 60€, I think a price of 30€ would be much more fair for a game of this quality, ultimately your choice will probably come down to: if you like Sonic you'll probably like this game, if not then you probably won't.\n\nTLDR: Good Sonic Game, Mediocre Game overall""]"
