"Get Ian Flynn to write every Sonic game after this, please! His writing for these characters makes such a difference!",,
Who knew getting good writers could make a good story,,
"They did it, they made a good Sonic game",,
Who knew that open world games could be fun if the player character doesn't have obese smoker stamina?,,
this game feels like greeting an old friend back into your life,,
You know what they say. If it has a fishing mini-game. Its an amazing video-game.,,
Big the Cat appears.,,
"This game was good. sometimes it did things i didnt agree with, but then it would be ok bc i got to listen to butt rock while sonic flies around and fish and stuff, so thats cool. I would say this is the best 3D sonic game since Sonic Adventure. If you are like me and have a brain problem where you think sonic is cool, this is a game you will probably like.",,
"At first I thought it controlled like garbage, than I scrolled through the options and found ""Jump deceleration rate"" and set it up to 0, at that moment I was free.

Just the sheer amount of customization to how sonic plays is worth your buying, no mods required

This game is cool as hell, the level design might not be the best, enemies might not be very smart or tightly design, but the controls and movement of the game makes up for all of this

BTW the story so far is decent, just because characters are in character. Knuckles is no longer a goof, he is the guardian of the emerald, sonic is a laid back cool dude but also caring and cheerful, etc.

Also, there's Momentum, in a 3D Sonic game. Therefore, I am happy.

"As a long time fan, Sonic Frontiers is the most fun I’ve had with a 3D Sonic game since Sonic Generations. This game does have issues, but as a whole, Sonic Frontiers is a really good time and moves the series a few steps in the right direction.

The story is a large improvement from the last few games. Throughout the last few Sonic games, the characters have felt butchered. Most characters were either made really dumb, annoying, or just plain pitiful. There were a lot of jokes and dialogue which rather than being funny, made my eyes roll or had me cringe. Sonic Frontiers corrects most of these issues and even improves the cast overall. The story tackles elements like the origins of the Chaos Emeralds, Cyberspace, an Ancient Civilization, and brings in references and events from past games within character interactions.

I appreciated the callbacks in the story and the new antagonist Sage is also a fairly well-developed character throughout the story. While I enjoyed story overall, some cutscenes didn’t quite work for me. Also, some cutscenes are stiffly animated and I feel the ending could have been better as it just sort of fizzles out instead of being grand or epic. With that said, the story did keep me engaged throughout and has some exceptional character growth and even some good arcs. Props to the writers for making these characters have actual depth.

Sonic Frontiers gameplay is really fun. I believe Sonic hasn’t controlled this well since the Adventure series. I found the moment-to-moment gameplay exploring and platforming across the islands to be really enjoyable throughout the entire game. I enjoyed platforming around finding memory tokens, completing small puzzles, and doing mini-games. There are puzzle types that repeated a little too often and some are just okay, but I appreciated that most of them were quick and never felt like a chore. I never found myself getting bored and there was rarely an instance where there wasn't something to do.

There are traditional type levels in this game called Cyberspace. I didn’t care for the stages initially. However, when I got used to them, I found them to be really fun, and some of the later ones I enjoyed a lot. I find that Cyberspace levels are at their best when speedrunning them. Performing a Homing Dash by boosting immediately after doing a homing attack can send you flying. I wish there were more than 4 themes in Cyberspace as some of the ones present have been done so much from previous entries. Fishing with Big the Cat is simple, but fun type of simple.

I thought the combat was decent. I did like the various moves you could unlock and it was satisfying chaining combos together. Parrying was a little too easy once I figured out how the mechanic worked. There was some good enemy variety with most being fine, but there are a few annoying ones. I found the mini-bosses and especially the Super Sonic Bosses to be very good. The Super Sonic Bosses are a highlight of the game in general. Unfortunately, the Final Boss was a disappointment to me. It didn’t ruin my experience, and it was definitely unique compared to all prior Final Bosses, but it could have been better.

For general issues: the pop-in is pretty bad, there is a bit of jank to the controls and bosses, and camera control is taken away a little too often. But despite all the problems I listed and a lack of overall polish, Sonic Frontiers was just really fun while playing it and the good outweighs the bad much more often.

The music in Sonic Frontiers is AMAZING! This may be my favorite soundtrack in the series. I loved it all, from softer island music to the EDM Cyberspace songs to the head-banging Titan Boss vocal tracks. It was all done extremely well.

Graphically this game is very good. Most of the environments are nice to look at and there are some beautiful sites, however, pop-in does detract from it. The Cyberspace levels also look good despite the theme re-usage.

To summarize the pros and cons:

Pros: story, characters, references, open zone platforming, movement controls, mini-games, cyberspace levels, combat moves, enemy variety, mini-bosses, Super Sonic bosses, fishing, the entire soundtrack, and visuals.

Cons: stiff cutscenes, camera issues, jank, visual pop-in, lack of level themes, and a disappointing Final Boss.

The final score I give Sonic Frontiers is an 8/10. I liked this game a lot. I hope Sonic Team sticks with this formula because they really have something here. Also, keep Ian Flynn on the writing team please, he did a great job with the characters. If this is able to be improved on we might just get the greatest Sonic game yet. The future looks bright and I look forward to what happens next… across these new frontiers.",,

"After finishing Frontiers, while the ending was unorthodox, I can definitely say this is worth your money and a solid addition to the Sonic franchise. Chaos Island is definitely the lowest point in Open Zone, and Cyber Space is rough, but despite all that I had fun and I got my worth out of this. If you're on the fence, at least give it a try and refund if it's not your thing. I really, really hope SEGA improves on this and increases the scope, especially of the ending (It's still a good ending! Just won't be what you expect).

They forged a new frontier with this one. Here's to hoping the next game is even better.

Sights, Sounds and Speed Update Thoughts: I won't lie and say I expected a lil more from this patch in terms of QoL, but according to Kishimoto he's saving a lot of it for Update 2 since he needed more time, so I guess we shouldn't have expected too much. Battle Rush does add a lot but I don't find myself wanting to play it UNTIL these new QoL updates hit the game.

Since we're now past the honeymoon period and the game is around 6-ish months old, Frontiers isn't the best Sonic game or even the best 3D effort. That goes to Unleashed in my opinion (pls port it to PC). This update does bring Frontiers up a lil bit though. If the game wasn't for you AT ALL, it still won't be, but if you saw something good in it but the lil things bothered you too much, this might be what gets you back in.

By the way we're getting the Spin Dash soon. Kishimoto even confirmed it when fans found it LOL. Hey, maybe we'll even get momentum. Don't hold your breath for that though.

Birthday Bash Update Thoughts:
This game is so, so much more fun now. Actually. Like, an entire point up on a /10 score system better. You finally have jump momentum, the spindash and even more QoL. Thank you so much, Kishimoto.",,
"This game is cobbled together from old assets, has a rather thin plot heavily held up by good character writing and references to older Sonic titles, and has a lot of jank.
I love it.
It's really damn fun to play, and honestly the occasional jank is usually more fun than it is annoying (with the only real exception being the lack of enough invincibility frames). The character writing is really damn strong, using the limited overall plot as a way to explore characters that haven't been allowed to be characters in the games for years. The gameplay is really fun, even when it can be unrefined, and the level design, while varying from being a bit underbaked to ""we just remade a whole level from Sonic Adventure 2"", never manages to be actively unpleasant outside a few sections where the designers got a bit too aggressive with making players latch onto a 2d plane in the open world (mostly notably on Chaos Island). Also, every boss fight manages to be incredibly fun and over-the-top. Hell, even the basic ass fishing minigame which completely breaks the game's progression is fun, if only because you can catch some very funny things (Sonic will be dying from various neurotoxins from holding poisonous frogs). While undoubtedly flawed, the strengths of this game far outweigh the downsides, even if I would suggest waiting for a sale if you aren't sold on it. It's a solid basis for Sonic to build on in the future (and hopefully they won't somehow still manage to rush the next game forcing the more traditional levels to be filled with reused assets).",,
Basically the Metal Gear Rising of the Sonic saga,,
Now give us Sonic unleashed...,,
As a Sonic fan for more then 20 years I have to say: I loved it and the fact that I played 25 hours over two days should tell you how much. 9.5/10,,
The OST alone is worth to play this game,,
"I can't believe I'm positively reviewing a Sonic game in 2022 but here we are, like, it's just fun? It's fun.

The pop-in is garbo though, if someone can fix that, that'd be bueno.",,

"DONT FORGET TO SAVE YOUR PROGRESS IN SLOT SINCE THE GAME DON'T SUGGEST YOU TO DO IT. SO IF YOU START A NEW GAME YOUR PROGRESS IN ""AUTOSAVE"" SLOT WILL BE WIPED

Pretty good game. One of the best sonic games since Adventure and Generations. Absolutely recommend!",,
"A joy from beginning to end.

Sonic Frontiers is the latest entry in the Sonic The Hedgehog series. Rather than go the usual, rushed game every year or two, SEGA and Sonic Team decided to take a different route this time, for Sonic’s 30th anniversary celebration (give or take a year late), and worked on this game for 5 years.

A bit of love and care went into this game. So much so that they actually brought in a veteran writer from the IDW comics to write this game. Meaning if you’ve been disgusted by the overly toony and terrible jokes and humor we’ve seen from the games since Sonic Colors released on the Wii, then you’ll be pleased to know that isn’t the case here. The characters are very well written out too, so they’re not so one sided. As you progress the game, Sonic helps them overcome some of their flaws. There’s also numerous call backs to Sonic Adventure 1 & 2, and various other titles and adventures the speedy blue hedgehog has had over the years. The writing team really excelled in this title.

Gameplay is pretty good in my opinion. There’s a number of islands you can play on, though they’re unlocked as you progress the story. From grassy fields and lush forests to ash blanketed isles. Each island is home to simple challenges that, when completed, unlock a portion of the map, often times unveiling another challenge or two, to give you a new idea of where to go next to help find your way around. These challenges also award seeds which are invaluable for leveling up Sonic.

Also on each island is a number of mini-bosses that award Portal Gears when defeated. Portal Gears are used to access Cyberspace levels, which, depending on how many missions you complete, award Chaos Emerald Vault Keys, which are needed to collect the Chaos Emeralds to progress the story.

Also on each island are side stories, memory tokens, koco purple coins, and a purple portal which takes you to a cyberspace fishing spot. Fishing is ideal for learning lore, and/or leveling up Sonic. Four attributes can be leveled up to level 99, those being Speed, Rings, Defense, and Offense. Speed increases Sonic’s top boosting speed. Rings increases the amount of rings Sonic can hold onto at once (which function as health). Defense lessens the amount of rings dropped when a hit is taken. Offense increases how much damage Sonic does when he attacks.

The soundtrack is pretty great. But what can you expect? It’s a Sonic game. The music is always great.

This game blew most Sonic games we got in the last ten years out of the water. And I’m proud to have been able to experience it first hand. Never played an actual brand new Sonic game on day one before (that wasn’t a remake, collection, or remaster) but I’m glad it was this one. It was a really fun journey. I can’t wait to see where they go from here.",,
"Sonic Frontiers Has a Problem With Repetition

feel free to watch this review in video form<<< click me

I liked Sonic Frontiers.

It's the first 3D Sonic game I've liked since Unleashed, Colours and Generations.

There's stuff I don't like and stuff I do like—but overall, I was left with a generic, insipid, yet enjoyable experience.

Movement, traversal, speed, exploration and combat are all things I loved about the game.

Simply moving around is a blast and very gratifying.

Traversing the open zones at breakneck speeds is exhilarating and Sonic Team even implemented sliders that allow you to tweak how The Hedgehog controls.

But of course, even with tighter and customisable controls, in good old sonic fashion, platforming still manages to be quite jank at times.

Despite this, the idea to allow the player to play around with the blue blur so that he feels exactly how you want him to feel is excellent and should be featured in every Sonic game moving forward.



I recommend anyone playing on PC to do the same, honestly makes the game 100x better...



The exploration is decent; it's no Scorsese, so don't expect elder scrolls or breath of the wild levels of mystery, wonder or intrigue, but it's there nonetheless.

I was honestly expecting the combat in Frontiers to be broken and bankrupt so it turning out to be one of the better aspects of the game was a very pleasant surprise.

Although this is still a Sonic The Hedgehog game, so don't expect the combat to be fully realised or thought out.




The game was in need of some innovation, and I wasn't surprised by any of the game's mechanics.

It simply took what we've come to expect from the open-world formula and threw Sonic into the mix.







Regardless, Sonic Frontiers is still a fun game; its mediocrity at times is overshadowed by its ability to entertain.




I constantly found myself getting bored during longer play sessions, long being like 40 minutes to an hour.





Rinse Repeat

You must suffer through this gameplay loop five times over with no alterations. There is nothing to shake up this formula other than the next hyper-realistic, beautifully dull environment for you to repeat everything you had done previously.

And each time, it becomes more and more monotonous.







Absolutely nothing to contrast one kingdom from the other.

Alas, Sonic Frontiers.

Now don't get me wrong, I think the game is beautiful, and it runs like freaking butter





Breath of the wild was a clear inspiration for this game.



And I feel like if Sonic Team realised this, the game would've had the variety; it's severely lacking.

We would've had environments, enemies and a story that's distinctive and faithful to the character.











But as if trapped in a chamber, the game is plagued by an echoing gameplay loop, and by the third island, I was exhausted and keen for the game to end.







But if anything, Sonic Frontiers is, without a doubt, a step in the right direction and, hopefully, a step towards a brighter future for the blue blur.

Thanks for reading ~",,

Best Game since Unleashed. & Generations xP",,
The open world portion of the game is amazing. But the cyber space levels feel like SEGA gave us a race car and then locked the hand brake.,,

"!! Sega please remove Denuvo !!

Denuvo forces you to have an internet connection or you can't play the game, and let's not forget the 24hr lockout.

Especially for Steam Deck and laptop users that do not always have internet access, it is the biggest problem with the game now. Will recommend the game once it is removed.",,

"Sonic Frontiers, an enjoyable experience but disappointing with shortcomings and flaws

It fixes problems from previous games, yet ignores some problems and creates some new ones.The game shines in many aspects but also makes you question the design choices made in some places; I'll mention what I like about the game and what I wish was better:

Steam didn’t let me dump my 4000-word essay review so I shortened it a bit, if you want to read the whole thing you can on the Steam forums :
Full version of my Steam review (Spoiler Free) 
A Guide for Sonic Frontiers
By: Spyder
Sonic Frontiers, A wonderful and enjoyable experience but with a lot of shortcomings and flaws . it fixes problems from previous games, yet ignores some problems and creates some new ones.



The gameplay loop of fighting mini bosses, finding portals and gathering chaos emeralds is actually well designed. it encourages exploring the map, you can even find some of the collectables like keys and gears in the open areas which sometimes are cleverly hidden, thus skipping some challenges if you want to. So, it’s not mandatory to complete everything in the open areas, yet I did anyways because of how fun it was.


The open areas are the highlight of the game, you'll easily get sidetracked and wander off to do puzzles or platforming challenges somewhere else. So, going from A to B never felt like a chore and I never wanted to fast travel.
Sonic's fluid mechanics and physics is the factor that makes traversing the map and completing the challenges fun, you can partake in precise platforming sections whilst being fast. I just wish its world had more style to it rather than being a realistic looking terrain with floating rails and platforms scattered around it. Even though these generic assets are what the maps mainly consist of, it’s fun to go through them and complete their respective challenges which I fully credit Sonic's well-tuned movement for. Keep in mind that custom structures, terrain, ramps and loop-de-loops are currently present in the maps but are overshadowed by the abundance of low effort floating assets. there are also these wall climbable walls, but climbing most of them is too automated with the included dashpanels that fling you forward.


Combat is also well executed and feels responsive, it’s easier than most action games but it’s not mindless button mashing. Enemies are unique and their designs are great, I really enjoyed fighting the mini bosses. Although for some of them you have to wait for an opening which kills the flow of the fights and makes encounters cumbersome. The main boss fights at the end of an open area are the cherry on top, the heavy rock music really pumps the adrenaline into your blood.
The actual problem with the combat is the balancing. The left side combos of the skill tree are easy to execute, they are better described as cutscenes rather than combos; most of them require only two input presses - whilst making you invulnerable - and you're more likely to execute them by accident. Annoying thing about this is that to start some combos you have to use your movement/mobility abilities like jumping or boosting, which you normally use to evade and run around enemies; after you unlock said combos, you’ll most definitely accidentally start a combo when you just wanted to gap close your enemy.
Also upgrading Sonic’s attack damage and defense makes the game really easy, it’s much more fun to make fights longer and not one-shot enemies.The above-mentioned points are balance problems though, they could be tweaked and modded; So, If I ever wanted to replay this game, I’d simply avoid unlocking most of the left side skill tree combos and keep Sonic’s attack damage and defense at level 1.


Cyberspaces are linear short stages that have the same formula as old Sonic levels, but for some reason the design team decided to change Sonic's perfectly fine physics and movement from the open world just to accommodate for the smaller and narrower level design, the best platformers have enjoyable movement and physics that are complemented by their level design which Sonic Frontiers’ Cyberspaces fail to do.
Most of the stages here are a permutation of slightly altered level layouts from previous Sonic games with different themes that are also from previous games, with only 4 themes at that.
They copied older stage layouts with no regards to Sonic’s movement and then tweaked the base physics to balance him for the said stages. you have two different feeling Sonics, the one in the open area feels good and the one you control in the cyberspace stages feels unresponsive and janky. Cyberspace Sonic steers much worse in higher speeds than the open area version and feels clunky, you lose your momentum when jumping, top speed is also heavily nerfed and besides the initial burst of speed you cannot feel the impact of boosting when holding it.
The challenges like collecting all red star rings and getting a S rank are a lot easier, not a single level had complexity in its Red Star placements, you can collect all of the rings in a single run and not bother at all with the branching paths, and besides a couple of stages getting a S rank wasn’t challenging at all.
To be fair not all of these stages are a slog, some are enjoyable. There are original stages that do not copy old level layouts which were fine. Some levels use stage layouts from Sonic Adventure 2 (2001) which fit Sonic’s Cyberspace physics quite well, the copy pasted levels from the Boost Era (2008-Present) make me want to play the games that the levels are actually based on.


I want to commend Ian Flynn’s story writing and how he respected each character’s development from the past 30 years. Since he himself is a Sonic fan, you can see how meaningful the character conversations are here.


I nominated this game for the best Soundtrack at the Steam Awards, loved mostly all tracks the game had to offer.






As discussed in this review, the open zone sections carry your experience, you spend more time exploring the open world than engaging enemies in combat or playing the Cyberspace stages, so it was fun overall. it’s also gorgeous looking and performs well, I didn’t have many bugs besides the obvious pop-ins which they should patch. The frame rate was also smooth, I heard the Switch version is also performing well and has steady 30 fps. So buy it if you're a fan, wait for a sale if you're not. giving it a 74/100.",,

"Come on down to Tony Hawk's Pro Sonic of the Colossus, with a dash of Ikaruga on the side.

Sounds like a preposterous title? Well, that's just the best way I have of describing what this game even is. The meat of Sonic Frontiers has you move and trick your way around an open environment, seamlessly jumping from one small platforming challenge to another, in order to reach collectibles scattered about. The sequence and path you do this in is entirely up to you, and you keep doing it until you reach an arbitrary collectible count for the zone, at which point you move on to another. Sound familiar? It should be, because what I just described to you is the basic game loop of the Tony Hawk skater games. Except instead of kickflips and McTwists you're using Sonic's classic menagerie of springs, rail jumps, and wall runs. Add a score multiplier and Goldfinger's ""Superman"" and you'd likely confuse it for a THUG mod.

And just like in those skater games, this basic game loop is very satisfying to engage with. Something about the freedom of movement combined with a steady flow of short, flashy platforming sections scratches a deep pleasure bone in your brain. So much so it makes spending hours completing the checklist of objectives a joy rather than a chore. And there's enough mini-games and side-activities to keep it from feeling stale. Oddly enough, the traditional Sonic levels are just such a mini-game.

The other half of the concoction is the bossfights. They are big - ranging from the size of buildings to skyscrapers. So big that you usually can't reach their weakpoint from ground level, and need to acrobat your way towards it. In some situations, this plays out exactly how you would expect - the bosses create various spring and rail-like objects that you use against them. But in other cases, they don't. Because you are expected to run and jump up their , Shadow of the Colossus-style. This is especially true for the main bossfights of the game - the Titans. Towering machines that won't even begin to fight you properly until you reach the top of their head. Once the fight does start though, you use a set of combo-meter-pumping attacks and a parry to inflict the actual damage. Not quite a spectacle fighter, but somewhere in the ballpark.

And lastly, you just get straight-up Ikaruga gameplay for some of the mini-games, and a major bossfight. Because... why not I guess? The game already is a bizarre amalgamation of things you wouldn't expect to mesh at all. Might as well throw in another. Somehow, it all fits together to make an experience that gets its hooks in you, and keeps you wanting to play more of it. With the assumption, that is, that this is the kind of formula you actually want out of a Sonic game...

But that begs a very important question: Do you? For a lot of people, I can imagine the answer to be ""Yes"". But equally, for a non-trivial amount of players I can imagine it to be a resounding ""No!"". As great as this new gameplay mix is, it's a stark departure from the series' previous games. It eschews a lot of its staples in service of the new approach. So most of your enjoyment will depend on how much, in your mind, this approach outweighs its shortcomings?

And does it ask you to forgive a of shortcomings! Bland artstyle, unimaginative environments, heavy asset re-use, the worst pop-in this side of the Switch, janky physics that sometimes decide to just not work, insta-kill QTE's that force you to restart the whole fight from scratch, and side content that often feels like a phone-in. The litany of problems it has makes the whole package feel makeshift at best, and downright lazy at worst. Depending on how many of them are a hang-up for you, you might want to wait for a heavy discount. Results will vary on whether this will feel like a game worth $60 to you.",,
"It’s like they crossed Sonic with Shadow of the Colossus.

This is by far my favorite Sonic game I have ever played in my entire life. And I know what kind of statement I just made.

Sonic is the only franchise that no matter how many times it disappoints me, I always get excited for the next game. Nonetheless following Kratos advice, I kept my expectations low so as not to be disappointed with this one. I was pleasantly surprised.

Sonic Frontiers just really makes you FEEL like Sonic.

I truly think this game is a must play for Sonic fans. It's a nice love letter to fans of the Adventure series and a good basis for games going forward.

This is an odd case of a game that is more fun than good. Running around islands, collecting stuff, platforming, combat and bosses... It's all so fun. But the game is ridiculously underbudgeted for what fun it provides. Imagine the most awesome B movie. That's Sonic Frontiers. It's phenomenal, it's fun, but it's flawed in some obvious aspects.

Something about it feels so natural and fun though. I loved running in the open world and bumping into different bosses. My only problem is I wish we got actual levels when you unlock the levels instead of 5 different short versions of Sky Sanctuary.

I also liked it a lot for the lore, for making Super Sonic actually powerful again. Not to mention all the character development. Tails wanting to find his own way, Knuckles and Amy wanting to live their own lives, hell even Eggman mentions Maria and how he wanted to meet her yet also envied her by taking attention away from him as a kid, it was all so fascinating to me. It just conveys such a melancholy and beautiful aura.

Game is fun, it has flaws but as an experience, its wonderful, definitely get it if you're a big Sonic fan, most likely you'll enjoy the game. Play it, don't come with the mindset to nitpick and it will be your favorite Sonic game.

8/10, for Sonic fans an 8 feels like a 12 anyhow.",,

"It's hard to start this with a resounding ""yes!"" Off the bat, if you are a Sonic fan you are going to love this game. If not... then you'll be able to pick apart basically anything it has wrong with it. It is really a great Sonic game. Not a great AAA experience. Sometimes the camera is hard to work with, the pop in can be a little annoying, and countless other small things. This is a hard step in the right direction for Sonic team and I really hope they work off of this. Would I recommend it to everyone? No. Sonic fans, and people who are used to fast paced games like this, absolutely yes. On the fence? Wait for a sale and I promise you will be pleasantly surprised. Just get used to the camera controls early.",,
"Sonic Frontiers 100% Completion Review:

After 51.3 hours Sonic Frontiers is 100% completed. This is for Steam Achievements and In-Game progress. I would probably say it was closer to 42-45 hours as I did spend some time AFK due to work or other things going on. This game consists of 5 different open-world islands with a **** ton of collectibles to gather. The fight mechanics are actually pretty cool and it's not the same stale thing over and over again like most games do.

I will say that 100% completing the game wasn't that difficult. I'd consider it moderate just due to the amount of collectibles you need to get. Most of them are pretty straight forward, but at least 15% of the thousands of collectibles take a little brain power to get. Also some of the puzzles were surprisingly difficult.

Overall I really enjoyed the game. This was the first time Sonic went completely Open-World and they did it well. There wasn't really any empty space as there was always a collectible to gather somewhere. Who would have thought that an open-world souls-like Sonic game would work. Also has some of the best music in any Sonic Game! Love the subtle EDM/Metal transition. Easily one of my favorite Sonic the Hedgehog games.",,
"The best 7/10 game you will ever play.

It's got plenty of issues, very noticeable pop-in, the cyberspace controls are pretty bad, and it's just a tad rough around the edges. But it's also got a fun gameplay loop on the overworld, great controls out of cyberspace, tons of options to fine tune the controls, and outstanding writing.",,
"Probably one of the better, if not one of the best 3D Sonic experiences so far in the series. Here is why:

Story

It is undeniable that the story hits a darker, more mature tone. Even though Sonic himself does not lose his identifying character traits, the story tackles serious topics such as fear, family and friends relations and the struggle to survive. As someone who has played all Sonic entries with stories worth mentioning, Frontiers is up there at the top. However, it is not without its obvious, grievous flaws. Somewhat unpolished, somewhat rushed, somehow not thought through til the end. But altogether, the characters play out nicely and a feeling of coherency stands out in the end (if you know you know lol).



Experimental, refreshing, different, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ clunky sometimes. Running around in the open world is a revelation - so much fun and so many things to do, to discover. It actually never got boring and I even loved the different island aspects (despite one, I'll let you guess). But here as well, the gameplay is not without flaws. Cyberspace levels are, well, to be frank, they are nothing more than an existing part of the game. They might add to the lore of the game but gameplay wise, they feel unpolished, Sonic Forces-esque and only a few of them stood out as being fun or engaging in any sense. They are forgettable and quite short, but no deal breaker, honestly.



This might not come as a surprise to anyone who has played a Sonic game before but the music is beyond mind-blowing. It is the existential aspect of the game that elevates it from ""hm-okay-yeah-playable"" to ""cinematic masterpiece"". The island themes are calm, relaxing and never bother or distract, so they are absolutely fine, a nice change regarding past Sonic entries even. But many of the Cyberspace themes and especially, and I emphasise it here once more, ESPECIALLY the boss themes hit the mark so hard that they have not left my personal music mix for several months now. They are not only outstanding songs regarding their quality, but their implementation during the fights and the emotional roller coaster during the scenes close to the ending of the game left a lasting impression and make this game more than simply any other 3D Sonic game, at least for me. The music is a clear vibe, sprouts with passion, and embodies the experimental approach this whole game takes.



If I had to rate this game, I would fluctuate between a 7 and 8. The potential of Sonic Frontiers is inspiring, admiring, and noteworthy. Despite its distinct flaws, the positives outshine the negatives without a doubt. Especially regarding its presentation, this game qualifies itself as a true contender to one of the best Sonic game ever made. Even though the gameplay often appears unpolished (I have not even tackled the fighting system, I'll leave it at that) and the story could have used more time in development, the overall impression left by the game is as the general public has received it - very positive. I have had a great time and I even felt motivated enough to go for all the achievements. If this is the future of Sonic the Hedgehog, then this future is bright, and there is no end in sight (there I go, I did it again).

Enjoy this game and thank you for reading.",,
u go relaly fast,,
Great game. Runs better that Jedi Survivor,,
My bed is in ruins,,
"Wait for a sale!

The game is just a big tech demo. The gameplay loop of running around the world is fun but can get old quickly. There is little variety to the open zones/worlds, all areas just kinda feel empty. Bosses are fun but there are not that many around, some are even just repeated versions of previously defeated. Music on the other hand is amazing, killer soundtrack for most of the game. It is a good step for the franchise but you might be better of waiting for the next one when they take what they learn here and flesh it out. If you are a Sonic fan you probably are having a blast but for people who don't LOVE Sonic this might not be for you.",,
"For clarity i purchased this for $25 during a sale, even with mods i'd not ever recommend you pay full price, especially for the deluxe edition.

Probably haven't enjoyed a 3D sonic title since Adventure 2 on GC back in the day with my GBA and Chao Garden. I started to notice the quality dropping when Heroes came around and just felt so off to me at the time.

Now i'll say this, it doesn't feel as feature filled or in depth with the lore as SA2 did. However thanks to mods from hedgemod launcher and various visual mods you can push the engine to the limit of your gpu and really make this feel like the closest thing to an adventure 3 we've had so far and that's mainly thanks to modders. Insane drawdistances and even a completely revamped lighting and color pallete that feels a lot more vibrant and it's not like some ENB mod either, the shadow improvements don't even effect performance! The mods are easily installed and draggable and most the phyics code is just a checkbox in the launcher!

The next highlight would be the modded physics, You can get this game feeling a ton more like a traditional more polished physics based system with jumps and even rails.

I feel Sega in the Vanilla game play it far too safe to the point i feel i'm literally on rails like a time crisis game where the paths are always predeterminted and for an open world hub of multiple isalnds? It leaves it feeling baren and something you can't resolve with mods. The Cyberspace mode certainly lends to the game along with those physics mods.

I'd have honestly refunded this game after half an hour had i not read a guide mentioning these fixes and improvements. Even having my Sonic look like the old SA2 model fully upgraded with modern textures was a dream along with SA Super sonic. Thanks to the color pallete mod with over 250 changes in each zone and biome it really feels like it has an identity compared to the washed out vanilla pallete.

It's thanks to modders this game got over 30 hours from me. Sega i feel have some obligation to appease sonic fans every year akin to Fifa or WWE games. If this game had about 2 years extra put into it from a talented group? It really could have topped SA2 for me but for sure $25 and 10 minutes of enabling mods and downloading a single launcher? Totally worth it.",,

"I went into this game having heard from some people it was alright, not good but not bad either.

But man, was I blown away. Where can I even start.

What immediatly won me over was the soundtrack with this game. Each and every single boss fight truely had me sitting on the edge of my seat hyping myself up. Because the combat and animations during the fights are amazing. But the music just makes it so perfect.

Do I have any complaints about the game ? No, not really. Every small thing got overshadowed by all the good things this game has to offer.

Would I recommend someone to buy this game for full price ? If they are a GIANT sonic fan, then yes. If you are not but want to experience the game, I'd say wait for a sale.",,
"The fact that we got dlc that fixed all of the issues this game had and on top of that it was all FREE???? Probably one of the greatest sonic games out there.

PROS:
-Fun addicting gameplay
-Plenty of exploration and side content to do
-Time trials, boss rush and free dlc you name it
-Absolute BANGER ost
-Very easy to mod
-Story is pretty good!

CONS:
-Cyberspace movement often too slow and sometimes janky
-Cutscenes are a bit boring
-Final horizons (free alt ending dlc) can be very unfairly difficult at sometimes. It almost seems as if they never play tested anything

Overall. I do recommend, even as a first sonic game!





NOW PORT UNLEASHED TO PC",,
"Sonic Team tried their best with this one, they pulled all the scripted sequences, all the 2D sections, they even dumbed down the boost formula even further, but despite their best effort to make a mediocre-at-best game like Forces was, this is one of the good ones.
So Sonic Frontiers is essentially a collectathon, you wander around open levels, clear platform challenges, solve puzzles and defeat enemies to get McGuffins that allow you to face more of the aforementioned challenges, to get even more McGuffins and so on. The difference this time is that you're Sonic, so you're really fast and, because of that, said open levels have to be really big, more akin to open world (dubbed Open Zone) areas rather then levels from a platformer.
The reason I'm saying that they tried their best to make a mediocre game and failed is that despite the egregious amount of scripting in a game genre about freedom of action, because of the same nature of that genre (and Sonic's insane mobility), said scripting can be easily bypassed. The result is a game that is good for the same reason some of the best 3d platformer are good (please don't read this as if I said that this game is as good as super Mario 64, that's a completely different sentence).What I'm talking about is the freedom of action and the sheer amount of cool stuff you can pull off.
You see, one of the main collectibles needed to progress the story are these ""memory tokens"", you can find these floating above far above your head, supposedly only reachable through really ugly platforms that are just lying around with no artistic cohesion whatsoever, giving this game its signature ""SEGA hired this man"" vibe. This platforming challenges are, per se, fine, but what really sets this game apart is how easy to break this are, yes, you can follow the standard path and run through loops and jump on springs, OR you can boost jump from a grind rail on the other side of the world, gain an insane amount of air and try to aim yourself to get the collectible. And the whole game is like this, you just need a ramp or an enemy and you can do whatever, not unlike super Mario 64's BLJ.
And that's the biggest strength of the game, once you complete a few missions in the map, the (again, very ugly) rails used as fast travel start collecting together, with enough finesse you can chain rails, platforms and attacks on enemies to travel the world without touching the ground, it's a similar feeling to chaining tricks in a Tony hawk game and can get really satisfying, even though it's not the main focus of the game but just a side effect.
And for these reasons my favorite open zone was the third one, despite being the worst design wise (full of 2D sections) simply because it was pushing me to find ways to go around them.I ended up collection ALL memory tokens in the game, and i can't stress enough how much is not needed to do so for finishing the game, you just need a fraction of those (and it's you don't want to get them the intended way you can still farm them for a couple of minutes in the fishing mini game (yeah there's a fishing mini game, it's pretty innocuous, you only have to play it is you want to read Eggman's diary)), you don't even need them to COMPLETE the game, you don't even get bragging rights from them, i just did it because i was having fun doing so.
The story is also an improvement from most Sonic games actually but ESPECIALLY Forces, where, instead of being edgy for the sake of looking important (but ultimately feeling shallow), has a much simpler story with a deeper meaning. We actually have a THEME in the story this time. The story in Frontiers is about facing the inevitable and the game explore how every character reacts to it, most importantly Sage, the series' new entry, who is so sure about what's going to happen that doesn't even bother explaining it to Sonic and instead is openly hostile to him who instead is still hopeful and it's going to fight no matter what. The writing also helps, for the first time in way too long we have actual character development, to the point where even missteps like force have payoff.All secondary characters have their substory connected to the main events of the game. Amy for the first time in the main series menages to feel like Amy, always thinking about love, without being annoying; Knuckles and Sonic's rivalry and friendship is felt through their dialogs and Tails is trying to grow up after Forces.
The rest of the game is fine:
So the game is good, but what worries me is how is SEGA going to evolve the formula, despite how wonky the game physics may be, the biggest problem of the game is that they're not broken ENOUGH, hopefully for the next game Sonic won't abruptly stop every time he jumps, but how i said, since the best aspects of the game happened by accident, I can just hope. EDIT:Jesus Christ i just re-read this, it's like twice as long as I thought, why nobody told me? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ editing the review made it lose the formatting and now it's unreadable, thanks steam",,

This truly was a Sonic Frontier,,
close as we're gonna get to sonic adventure 3,,
"This is truly one of the best 3D sonic games of all time. The graphics are amazing, and the sound design is god tier. The music in this game is by far my favorite part.

However I wished the PC port was a bit better though, having a cap of 60 fps and limited graphic options is upsetting, but not even to kill the vibe of the game.

Edit: Alright. I've taken the time to actually play the game now and it's still pretty good. The writing in the story is great and I can follow through it nicely. The side stories with Sonic and the gang is quite enjoyable, and I'm glad they are in the game. Also, Sage is pretty funny.

The open world part of the game feels gimmicky, it was fun for a while, but it started to get repetitive and boring after. The levels are nice and fun, but I just wished some weren't copy and pasted from past sonic games.

I wanted a challenge so I started my game on the hard difficulty option, however the guardian and titans fights still felt really easy. That's not saying I didn't enjoyed these fights, because I did, but fighting the titan with a couple of quick time events sprinkled into it with a very easy timing window didn't seem ""hard"". The final threat also felt underwhelming so to speak.

The sound design and music is still very good. I enjoy these parts the most during my playthrough of this game. 8/10 video game.

Edit 2: The OST is still fantastic.",,

"This is easily the best Sonic game to come out since Generations IMO. A bunch of stuff to do and the open world doesn't really ruin the experience.

There are a bunch of mini-stage like challenges all around each island, as well as optional full size stages to unlock. You can skip all the stages if you want and just farm baddies or fishing to collect all the things you need but the stages are worth playing if you enjoy Sonic's platforming style. My one gripe is the skateboard mechanic should have been used a lot more!

There are some stats to upgrade adding a sort of RPG feel to the battle system. It's still the same old action combat but with some math factored in. The combat feels smooth and if you find the number of combos overwhelming you can set some or all of them to trigger automatically while you mash attack.

The graphics are nice but the world does seem a tad washed out. Maybe that's just the design they were going for IDK. Where the game falls mostly flat is the audio department, aside from the Super Sonic boss battles I didn't really find any bangers in the playlist, at least not nearly as awesome as Adventure's soundtrack.

Overall I'd say this is well worth your time and dime if you are a platformer fan!",,

"Alright, my first serious review, because this needs to be said.

I'm gonna preface this by saying, i am a longtime, hardcore Sonic fan, i literally could not hate him if i tried, my first game, the very thing the got me playing games, was Sonic Colors for the Wii, and the blue blur has stuck with me ever since.

Despite everything: the flaws with this game, Sonic teams past failures, and Sega rushing them to put out content, this game is still a freaking masterpiece in my opinion. Really, i believe the reason Forces and Lost World were crap was because they were rushed, and not by themselves. Sega Sammy (mostly the latter) are the ones that put sonic team on a short time limit, and the fact they were able to make something playable at all is impressive given the circumstances they had to work within.

Frontiers however, i have heard rumors that reps at sonic team begged and pleaded for more development time, and the game was STILL forcibly rushed by about a year, which is most likely what made the lategame subpar in most peoples opinions, it shows how little Sega cares and how much Sonic Team does.

Still, that extra time paid off, as this game is the most fun I have had with sonic in over 7 years, its not too graphically impressive, but still managed to look and feel unique and beautiful, The gameplay, mostly the combat system, is among some of the best sonic has to offer. Level design is meh (simply because Cyberspace isn't the most fun part of the game to put it simply) but manages to get the job done and not feel unfair constantly. The music? do i even need to say anything? go listen to any of the 3 boss themes or the main theme, the very thing i have on repeat to keep me focused while writing this.

Its literally the same concept that one Circletoons animation about this game had, it being ""mid"" is still a perfect 10, and that is SOLELY becuase of how impressive it is given the working enviroment. Sonic Team wanted to give us something with their passion poured into it. something sonic fans will play and think ""man, they do care about our words"". In my humble opinion, they did it.

""They said we'd break, they said we'd lose, but here we are, what else is new?""
""You and me we're built on trust, thats why we can always get up...""
Two of my favorite lines from One Way Dream, a song in the game that is confirmed to be a message from Sonic team to the sonic community, as a love letter to the fans, and a big fat middle finger to the haters.

He's here, reach far across these new frontiers, and he has the ones he loves in his hands.
Sonic is back.

For those wondering why i returned it, its simply because my computer is nearly 8 years old at this point and lags from watching discord streams, it could never hope to run this game. I did however beat this game on Switch, making this review valid.",,
"When I first started playing Sonic Frontiers, I wasn't sure what to think of it. The game just felt like a game, no impressions, positive nor negative, however when I played past the 3 hour mark I started getting into the addictive gameplay loop and enjoyed it a lot more. It isn't perfect, it should've been delayed, but it is the best Sonic game we got in the past 10 years and finally a game that I would even recommend to non-Sonic fans.

First, let's talk about the open-zone, which is a fancy word for a huge hub world you can explore. There are different islands to see. Traversal on these islands is a lot of fun, because, while it sounds like a gimmick, you simply go fast. Sonic feels really good to control, and it's simply fun to explore the islands at such a speed. Of course, there are a few things to do on these islands. You can do small parkours, challenges, beat enemies, minigames, fishing, or Cyberspace levels, which are the more linear levels. The game is a collectathon, so you get rewarded for most things with collectibles, meaning whatever you do, it is worthwile.

On these islands you find many rails and typical Sonic level elements. When you do them you go on a short trip that feels like a small level with additional alternate paths. These parkours are quite fun, and occasionally even better than the linear levels. It almost feels like a playground. Most of them are in 3D, but some are in 2D, and whenever you're doing the 2D ones you're stuck in the 2nd dimension, which breaks the pace for a bit, since if you don't wanna do them, you have to find a way out. I think the optimal solution would be a simple button to press to get back into the 3D space, luckily though, these 2D sections are mostly reserved for the third island. Furthermore, there are boost pads all over the place, and they're automating Sonic for a few seconds, which is questionable, because the point of the game is the freedom to walk around. Either Sonic Team should remove them, or make them go both ways, because at times it feels like you're fighting the game's mechanics. They should make the rails homing attackable instead, so the player initiates the parkours by choice, not by being thrown in there. It isn't a big annoyance, cause you always get rewarded, but it is unintuitive game design. Also, the parkours don't look nice, they just float and pop-in whenever they're needed, would be cooler to have it look more natural, like having a natural looping and so on.
There are also challenges which are really simple and easy, like doing a quick puzzle or having to go from A to B quick. Despite the lack of difficulty, I feel like they implemented them quite well, since you always keep going, never stopping. It felt like there was always something to do, no matter where you go.

Then, there's combat. First of all, the enemy variety is vast, there are dozens upon dozens of enemies, and minibosses to fight, each being a little different. The combat itself is a bit more style over substance, meaning there are many animations, it's very flashy, and at times button mash-y. There are different attacks, which you do by pressing two buttons at the same time, but you can use most attacks whenever, which is a bit OP, since some attacks deal heavy damage with no build up. That is a bit odd, cause you sometimes end up doing attacks unintentionally. I think it should be fixed by rather starting a combo, by pressing X, for example, a few times, and then you can start dealing heavy damage. As it is now, combat is fun, but for heavier attacks there should be a risk & reward system.

Now let's talk about Cyberspace. It's mediocre, if you never played Sonic it might be fun, but I really feel like it isn't great. Sonic's physics are altered during the levels, and he feels stiff, but also responsive at times, meaning a lack of consistency. His boost is a mere run button, it never fully depletes, which is odd, because the point of the boost is to keep it going by being good at the game. Sonic's moves are also a bit lacking. You don't have a short hop to keep your momentum, lightspeed dash doesn't keep your momentum either, you can't attack enemies from below, his homing attack is very slow and feels more like a combo starter without a combo, and the drop dash is poorly implemented. It's no use! It's the slowest movement option. Sonic overall feels painfully slow.
The levels themselves often feature level sections from older games, and they just make me feel like I wanna play the original level instead. It's good for newcomers, but it's noticeable when parts were made with different physics in mind. The very few original levels we do get are mostly fine, some are even good, but many have questionable level design where the easier paths are the fastest ones, or paths are just ordinary shortcuts.
There are also some small quality of life features missing, like when you pass a checkpoint I'd like to know my previous time to find out if I'm on a better pace than before, additionally dying before the first checkpoint doesn't reset your timer, and I would like to know when I'm in control of Sonic during the beginning of each level, like Sonic Generations' ""Ready? Go!"".

Story-wise, the game is nothing groundbreaking. It answered a few questions, but it honestly answered less than I and many hoped for. They also wasted the climax of the story, which might be because the last half of the game was rushed. However, the writing is finally bearable. Sonic doesn't talk like a socially inept Reddit user who posts daily memes, and they actually gave Tails a short character arc, to address his mistreatment in the past games. For a non-Sonic fan it's nothing groundbreaking, but for a fan they finally nailed Sonic's character. The only issue I had with Sonic was him not even mentioning what happened at the ending, he was just like ""ok let's go home"" and moved on.
Dialogue is good too, but at times they simply let the characters run through an emotion for a second, leading to awkward silence.

I think I should elaborate on the ""the last half of the game is a bit rushed"" statement.
The last two island don't have a lot going for them, they reuse the same assets, and they aren't anything great. They reuse a biome you already explored making it feel like mind numbing repitition, and the final boss, especially the secret final boss were rushed. They both are by far the weakest in the game.

Last, but not least, the game's technical aspects arent great. Sometimes if Sonic walks on a small incline you'll be sent flying, some animations abruptly stop to put you in your default pose, and obviously the pop-in isn't great. Also, I heard of some people having performance issues, for me the game ran buttery smooth, but started having a few more issues when I played the fourth island.

Another thing I would like to add is a critique I already had for Sonic Origins, the missing leaderboards.
It's Sonic, showing off how fast you can go is a given, so obviously online leaderboards would be the way to go.

Sonic Frontiers has a lot of jank, pop-in and unpolish, especially the last island felt rushed, and it's a bit too easy. There are many issues, but most of them I pointed out are rather small nuisances that I just want to address, so Sonic Team hopefully won't do these mistakes again. This game lays a great and unique foundation for what could be the best 3D Sonic game. For the first time in my life I can actually say that I'm looking forward to the future of Sonic. 7/10",,

"When I was 7 I would go to my local Game Stop just to watch the demo of Sonic Adventure, because I had never seen a game where the character could go that fast and it blew my little kid mind. Though that game was awesome it had it's many problems as well, and never fully lived up to what little kid me imagined it would be. This game IS what I imagined and more! It's just a bummer I had to wait this many years to finally get to play it.",,

It isn't often I consider writing reviews but the release of this game is so peculiar to me because I have to really wonder what alternate reality I fell into and if I even played the same game as other people giving near perfect/outright perfect reviews to this title.

+Immediately what stood out to me and what I enjoyed the most out of the game was its soundtrack. While a lot of the music isn't what I would attribute to a Sonic title, I still enjoyed a lot of it on its own merit. My only wish was for more remixes of past, lesser visited themes.
+While the story is extremely basic/lacking, the writing of dialog and the characterization is mostly ok/good. Flynn is good. More story cohesion with the narrative would have been appreciated.
+Movement is more or less decent and serviceable. Some gripes/differences from previous boost games but ultimately it is minor and not the worst part of the game.
+The actual stages are what I enjoyed playing, along with the world bosses. They are pretty much the only content I was playing for, which leads into...

-The absolute tedious, busy work of the overworld. So much padding and collecting things...to just collect more things, repeatedly. Extremely repetitive.
-The overworld itself. Completely uninspired and terrible, there was no love in its crafting or attention to detail or charm. Something that looks like stock assets and then they just salt and peppered random obstacles all over the place and called it complete. The few unique challenges were cute diversions, but only just. They could not justify the free roaming mechanics that borrowed a lot of inspiration from different other games (namely BOTW) without understanding -why- it was designed as such. Just left me wanting for the charm of Unleashed or Colors.
-Horrible UI/menuing. Trying to quickly navigate/do an extremely routine action was made tedious by animation delay/inconvenient order (upgrading, quick restarting of a stage to name my main gripes).
-The extreme pop in is a given. Terrible.
-The pinball minigame is awful.
-Finally, the true end boss was extremely lackluster, underwhelming and anticlimatic. If it was part of a multiphase boss fight, it wouldn't be bad at all, but that isn't the case. Followed by 3 QTEs. That's it. Something I would not expect from a Sonic title.

There's probably some thoughts I'm missing but ultimately these are the biggest sticking points in my mind. It's a really, really rough game and this implementation of open world for Sonic did not work. I only played this to completion because it was bought for me by a friend who wanted me to stream it for our friend group as a source of entertainment. If you really wanted to play this, I would wait for an extremely deep discount.",,

"Sonic franchise fan since 1991 here, and literally nothing has felt more ""Sonic"" for me than taking on bosses with max speed in Sonic Frontiers. There's always something to nitpick in any game, but so far, I find a lot more to enjoy here. Definitely recommend it for anybody else who just gotta go fast! To be honest, the pop-in effect didn't bother me much, and I hardly noticed it.

When I first heard of the open world concept, I thought it was a terrible idea... but now that I've played it, I think a character with the superpower of speed is a natural for open-world exploration. It makes traversing the map feel really really cool. I've never had a game that feels so much like what I imagine Sonic-style action from the comics/movies to be. It threads the needle of paying homage to classic legacy but still exploring some evolving concepts. With all the franchise desecration in the world these days, I'm glad that Sonic is still going strong.

It may not be as accessible as other more straightforward Sonic games (like Colors or Mania) for younger players, and the themes are less whimsical and more dark, but not depressingly so (and more importantly, that ""darker"" tone is not the darkness of a Shadow the Hedgehog edge lord trying to be ""gritty""). It's just the exploration of mystery and the shadowy unknown, rather than the brightness of a space theme park or Green Hill Zone.

And yes, the music is worthy of a Sonic game, too!",,

Gotta go fast!",,
"Get this game when its on sale, its not worth the 60 dollars.
In general, its a mixed bag. The character writing is great, but the story is undercooked. The open zone gameplay is amazing and the Cyber Space linear levels are god awful.
Its certainly better than Forces, but this is no Generations.
Still, I think its a step in the right direction for the Blue Blur. And lord knows, there's a lot to love here, even if its incredibly flawed.",,

I would say with all of the quality of life changes (Especially the spindash) this game is leaps and bounds better than when it launched.

Major respect for the team still putting there all into this game, and doing the changes that only improve and make the game better.

The fact cyberstages arent complete ♥♥♥♥ with the spindash anymore is something worth celebrating in its own right honestly.

Looking forward to update 3!",,

Sega, I love you but you made a stupid idea on having denuvo in this game, Its killing my fun here and I like to have fun!!! why do i need to be online all the time playing this, why am I getting locked out? and also, Why kill your modding support?!?!? They were why i wanted to play this on PC, are you made people are making thing look good or skins that could be dlc or something???

if you dont remove this Dang Denuvo Junk, you will make alot of us sonic fan come after you here and start a war on this.

"This is one of those games where I wish there was a mixed recommendation option on Steam. While I don't hate the game, it's nowhere near as good as most of these reviews make it out to be.

Honestly I was extremely skeptical buying this and I'd be lying if I said the very positive reviews didn't sway me but let's face the facts. This game is in DESPERATE need of a day 1 patch if not multiple patches over a short period of time. The pop ins are embarrassing to say the least and while you don't always notice them, when you do it's pretty jarring.

People saying the graphics are gorgeous? That's a stretch. I'm playing this on the highest settings possible in 2560x1440p with a 2070 Super and an Asus Predator XB271HU monitor yet it still looks like your typical dated Sonic game. It's fuzzy, textures are nowhere near as good as they should be, and the rain looks absolutely horrendous. This game actually looks better using TAA instead of FXAA. But I digress, it's still pretty bad.

Despite that though I will admit people mentioning how great the soundtrack is aren't lying. It's pretty damn good. Maybe that's because I'm still fresh in the game and I haven't grown tired of the music yet but hopefully the game doesn't recycle the same songs after a while and manages to keep things fresh.

Combat wise it's decent. It's definitely interesting but I can see myself getting bored of it after a while. There's not too much going on in terms of the skills and abilities you unlock to keep this aspect of the game flowing. To each their own though, I'm sure some of you will disagree but this is just my take on it.

When it comes to exploration I can't put too much of an opinion on the matter due to the amount of time played before writing this review but maybe I'll update it. That being said it's fun. Despite my complaints I can't seem the put the game down. Though lack of a chao garden is a completely missed feature and I'm sure would have been such a great addition to this open world direction Sonic Team has gone. It's a shame it wasn't included. I just hope exploration doesn't grow stale due to repetition.

Story is alright from what I can tell so far. It's nothing special. I'm on the second island and the pacing is extremely slow. There hasn't been any plot development yet and despite progressing through an entire island I still have no clue what's really going on or why I ended up where I am. Even interacting with Sonic's friends have given me little to no insight on the matter. I'm hoping this changes soon.

Voice acting isn't all that either. Sonic's VA especially just doesn't hit right for me and I can't see myself ever growing to like it. Nothing against him personally, I just feel the tone in his voice does not fit Sonic. But again, this is my personal opinion and I'm sure others will agree or disagree. The other cast itself is definitely a mixed bag.

Anyway in truth this game definitely gives me MIXED feelings. It's not completely awful, but it's also not as amazing as people here have claimed. Is this truly the BEST Sonic game that's ever been released? No, and that's a bold statement to claim. Is it worth full price? Absolutely not. This is easily a wait for sale at $30 or under type of game. Honestly at times it feels like a tech demo for what's to come in future Sonic games.

I'd say it's mediocre at best and while I enjoy it I also think it's missing a whole lot more that could have really made this game shine. But patches are an absolute MUST that need to come within the following weeks because there's plenty of things including the pop ins that I had mentioned earlier that need to be corrected.",,
This is easily one of Best Sonic Games ever Created. Amazing touching Story through all jorney while you can feel sonic journey through past games too. and Ammount of outside platforming is just insane unlike annything i saw before! You can easily lost yourself in them for all hours having absolute blast and fun! Sonic got most amazing combat skills than any other games and boss battles being truely cherry on top being just breath taking with outstand music. Huge freedom maps with total freedom to play however you like it with all costumization you desire. Easy challenges which are easwily satisfying and not at all annoying hard to complete. This wholesome ultimate Package in single Sonic Game is something which could every true sonic fan would dream to experience at least one in life time!,,
"I am not the usual Sonic games player, but when I saw the good reviews, the open world tag and that it alternates 2D and 3D levels, I was sold. I am very happy I got this game. It looks like it is a great entry into the Sonic world for newcomers.

I managed to 100% achievements in around 25 hours, it was starting to feel grindy in the Chaos Island, but I think it is just that this level was the weakest in terms of design in the game. When I reached Ouranos Island, it was fun again and I had a good time finishing it in a few sittings after dropping the game for a few months.

The story of the game is pleasant, I enjoyed discovering the things behind the world bit by bit. It is nothing groundbreaking, but you kinda want to know what happened to those-who-built-everything.

Gameplay itself is fun and with a skill you can just bypass the whole combo and tricks part by making it automatic (though your hits will be weaker), so you can choose how laid back you want to play.

The music is fantastic, I often listen to a few tracks outside of the game. The boss tracks are outstanding and very enjoyable.

Overall, it was a rewarding and pleasant experience and it ended just when I was starting to feel I had enough of it. In the end, one less game in my backlog and I can say that it is a strong member of my game library.",,
"This one is a massively mixed bag. It's the best 3D Sonic game since Generations by far and it's a good direction to take the series, but wow, this game is jank. Still fun (sometimes) though. Sonic Team must be working with a very restrictive development time window or their team is small because there are so many clunky if not broken mechanics to the game. The camera is the real threat here. It's constantly moving on its own and locking itself in useless positions for pointless cinematic angles. Even control is taken away at several points just to further restrict control. If you're gonna sell us on the concept of Sonic having more freedom than ever before, actually give us that then. The pop-in is just the worst. I've never played a game with more egregious pop-in that you CANNOT tweak ever before in my life. The open world is the best part, but it's empty and honestly makes little sense. I'd rather have the hub design of Sonic Adventure since it at least had life to it. Why are there just random grind rails everywhere? Nonetheless, this is the area where you truly have the most freedom and control and the gameplay shines the most here. Nonetheless, the handling of Sonic just still feels off mainly because there's no momentum to speak of. It's clunky and hard to control. I don't know how Sega pulled off semi-realistic physics on the Genesis, but struggle recreating it in 3D. The homing attack feels slow and delayed compared to previous games like Sonic Adventure. The Cyberspace levels unfortunately are terrible. They're extremely short, linear, recycled, completely forgettable stages that can be 3D or 2D. The 2D stages are just the worst. Sonic feels so slow and has little control when in the air. The camera is a massive hindrance in these stages especially. He loses all momentum while jumping. Even if you tweak the acceleration settings, they only apply to the open world and not the Cyberspace levels. They feel like they belong in a different game. The dialogue and voice acting are quite good, but once again, Sonic Team forget how to direct cutscenes with any style. Characters just stand in front of each other talking in the majority of cutscenes with little facial expression or movement of their limbs. Combat is broken. There's an unlockable ability that lets you just spam energy attacks by just holding a single button after jumping and it annihilates most enemies in seconds. The soundtrack is fire. I can't complain here. Mini-bosses are varied and pretty fun as well as the bosses themselves, but they aren't very challenging or memorable. Sonic has rarely ever had good boss fights tbh. The game is a mess overall. Fun, ambitious, and promising, but I can't just ignore these gripes. It needs maintenance ASAP. I think what really hurt my personal enjoyment of the game is the fact that I played Spark The Electric Jester 3 at the same time and comparing the two, Spark has superior level design, control, physics, but it's still flawed unsurprisingly. High speed platformers are hard to make and are rarely made, but Spark does it best in 3D in my personal opinion. I think both games are worth getting, BUT I'd say wait for a sale on this one. 6/10 as of now.",,

"despite some jank, this is just pure dopamine and a fantastic foundation for an exciting future to the series! Plus the recent free update gave the game even more replay value!",,
"Overall I do recommend this game, but much like how Cyber Space levels put an asterisk on your time if you use the Homing Dash, my recommendation comes with an asterisk as well.

The primary gameplay loop is a surprising breath of fresh air. Aside from a forced tutorial section, you're mostly free to explore and progress as you see fit. Don't want to do all the Cyber Space levels (not that I'd blame you for that)? No problem, there are plenty of ways to get the collectibles you need. Don't want to repeatedly fight more progressively time-consuming Guardians? Pay a visit to Big's Fishing Spots or randomly find more Portal Gears while exploring. Don't want to hoover up all the Memory Tokens that litter each map? You get more than enough from exploring the islands, and mercifully there isn't even an achievement attached (though I still did that simply because I could).

So what did I like about this game, you may be asking? Well, boosting and jumping around large open zones, for starters. Especially after tuning Sonic's speed and maneuverability to my liking, I found it such a joy to run around that even after unlocking fast travel options I'd mostly just stick to running around to my heart's content because it's simply more fun to do so.

While most Sonic games tend to not have worthwhile narratives, Frontiers manages to actually have a somewhat compelling narrative centered around a sparser cast of characters exploring the ruins of an ancient civilization. Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Sage, even Dr. Eggman felt like believable characters with actual depth to them. Frontiers as a whole offers a more somber tone, while not being over the top edgy like certain past entries. Every story beat got me even more invested and wanting to see more.

Circling back to gameplay for a moment, this game NAILED the boss fights, by which I mean the Titans that you face at the end of each island. The songs accompanying these fights were an audible treat for my ears, and the actual gameplay of them felt strangely reminiscent of Metal Gear Rising, of all games. If I had to say one negative thing about the Titans, it's that I wish there were more of them.

Comparatively speaking, I wasn't entirely sold on fighting Guardians, essentially minibosses that you find scattered around each island. From the second island onward, most of them were just timesinks that took far longer to even get a chance to hit than they had any right to. It got to the point where after fighting them once for the achievement for fighting all of them, I would go out of my way to avoid them because I had other things to do.

Sonic Frontiers offers a very solid foundation for future entries to build upon. What worries me most is the very real possibility that Sonic Team will fall back into bad habits again. But considering how much I enjoyed this game, I'd prefer to be cautiously optimistic. The future is bright for the Sonic franchise. One can only hope that Sonic Team has truly learned from their past mistakes this time around.",,
"SONIC FRONTIERS is one of the weirdest games I've ever experienced. and, by AAA+ standards in the 2020's, it's EXTREMELY weird. almost unthinkably weird.

and usually when someone says a game is ""weird"" it's to say that it's ""comedic, random, shocking"" etc. this goes right in the other direction, and it's one of the best examples I can think of where piece of popular media's SOUNDTRACK alters and *betters* the emotional experience. and it's a mainline Sega Sonic game. the same character that was once voiced by Steve Urkel in a nutty cartoon show in the '90s.

you start the game and you're almost immediately smacked in the face with this odd, plain, muted menu with this bizarre soft music. and already I'm thinking ""what the hell? what? Sonic??"". but the think is this -- I'm not OFF-PUT by it, I'm sincerely ENGAGED. and I'm going to say the music has at least 60% to do with it.

(the score by - I have to look this name up - TOMOYA OHTANI with others is this game's biggest asset. it's otherworldly and dreamy. it's everything I DON'T think of when I think of Sonic the Hedgehog, and I can't believe they made it this way.)

so I don't care about Sonic the Hedgehog. I loved the games growing up, I played them when they first came out. I still think the second one is a pretty damn good game. I know that a lot of people are . . . . ""oddly enthusiastic"" about this character. I don't know why, it's just the way it is, and even though Mario has starred in at *least* ten all-time masterpiece games that (let's be real) probably no Sonic title will ever, ever touch, nobody gets all stoked and bothered about Mario Lore. it's a weird world we live in, but go do your thing. don't hurt anybody, do your thing, the world goes 'round another time.

so I picked this up because of the good word on it, and I . . . I kind of really dig it. I'll never beat it, I'll never be passionate about it, but it left an impression in me just the same. is it the music? is it the flow? is it the fishing? (it's NOT the fishing) is it the boss battles? (no) is it the . . . what is it? it's got the ""X"" Factor. it's that something else that I'm sure most game companies would castrate their boardroom with live hedgehogs to achieve, yet here we are, and it's a Sonic game. . . . NOT a series famous for it's quality in the last, oh, 30 years or so.

it's just a weird, weird game. and it stuck with me. I'm always on-guard by new AAA games starring old legacy characters because I'm on the ever-vigilant lookout for pandering and obnoxious, bad, instantly-dated humor. so any game that not only DOESN'T do that but also does kind of the exact opposite . . . I applaud. I approve. the gameplay's fine, much better than expected, but it's the MOOD. it's the VIBE. the music, the visuals, the weird basicness of how they name their bosses and style their tech objects.

what can I say? it's just a weird game in a time when ""weird"" and ""AAA budget"" just don't ----ing happen anymore. if they'd worriedly took this thing in to American focus-grouping, it'd have been shouted down quicker than the 45th President at a Mexican Day of the Dead parade. they'd want bad jokes, worse music, political statements about whatever's trendy that week. not because people are DUMB, but because we just so rarely *actually know* what we WANT. often we don't know what we want until we suddenly find it.

so, SONIC FRONTIERS -- one of the moodiest, most tranquil AAA video games I've ever seen. add the solid gameplay that runs and looks great and . . . yeah, it's a winner. I don't know how, I don't really care. it's a happy time for Sonic fans, I guess. which is great. go do your thing.

and the world goes 'round another day.

be well everybody. I recommend this, absolutely. an increasingly-rare AAA hit, done with care and craft and patience. awesome.",,
"For a first attempt at an open world Sonic game, it's a good start for future games to build upon this gameplay style. It's fun to just roam around and the Cyber Space stages are fun to speedrun. The combat, while not the best of all time, is still fun and gives some variety rather than just doing a homing attack. Not a perfect game but the highs are so good, especially with the Super Sonic boss fights.",,
"I think this game deserves two distinct reviews to fully understand why it's so relevant for The Sonic Franchise

*As a regular player: Yeah the game is really fun and charming. Sure it's not perfect as it can be a little repetitive over time and not so challenging at all, but none of this really take the spot when it comes down of playing. Just make sure you're here for a nice and innovative combat game of the Sonic Series and you'll enjoy.

*Now as a Sonic Fan: I must say they really did it. They're really investing on the idea of seriousness of the Franchise once again. Sonic, his friends and even Dr, Eggman are all back on their original characters with consistent dialogues and motivations between them. I really thought that after Sonic Forces, all future games were doomed to be a mediocre experience with super boring jokes and flat characters, since Forces also tried to make a more threatening plot with Infinite and the Eggman War (and ended up as boring and ridiculous as we now). Yeah, dare I say it: I think the franchise has a bright future with Ian Flynn's writing and the wish to make every Sonic game a different and innovative experience with their best efforts.

TL;DR
Yeah, I think it's a fun game that deserves a 7.7/10, but means something way greater for the Sonic Franchise. Good work Sonic Team. Let's see what the future has to offer",,
"Thoughts and observations so far.

Solid / Noteworthy Points:

+ Combat gameplay is much more diverse through the addition of different movesets that distinguish Sonic from previous 3D games, which generally boiled down to boosting and homing attacks to complete enemy encounters.
+ Enemy encounters are pretty varied and can be fun.
+ Boss fights are definite highlights.
+ Soundtrack is great.

What needs work:

- The open world is bland, uninspired and lacks any life and substantial content outside of simplistic mini-games and collectables.
- Gameplay loop and progression is blatantly formulaic/simple as it involves you running around and collecting currencies that eventually enable you to fight the major boss of the relative zone.
- Lacklustre art style/ art direction that doesn't have any coherence and compatibility with Sonic as shown by the abstract enemy designs and bland realistic environments. This becomes apparent when playing through the Cyber Stage levels as they have more appealing designs that really match with what would have been an appropriate style ( even if they're recycled from previous games )
- Constant pop-in as well as a 60 FPS cap.
- An overall lack of polish. This is very apparent through the camera controls, general gameplay, physics as well as animations.
- While combat is more diverse, most encounters can be completed by spamming a single attack button or through the ""Sonic Boom"" move which has no cooldown and allows the player to basically dish out infinite projectiles at the enemy.
- The open world environment is poorly designed as each major zone is jarringly filled with springs, platforms and rails that are randomly placed without any natural or thematic integration.
-Cyber Stage levels seem to follow 4 major aesthetics: city, green hill, sky sanctuary and chemical plant. The core level designs are either original or based on existing sonic levels that are coated under one of these major aesthetics, it'd be nice if they followed more diverse level designs for these instances.

It's still a fun game and is a good step for Sonic but there are still major problems. Going forward this game could serve as a solid foundation/blueprint for future games. Sonic Team classifying this game as an ""Open-Zone"" game rather than open-world is a means to probably isolate it from obvious criticisms but the general approach and design are still technically open-world and criticisms are valid regardless of any blanket terms that are used.",,
"Great Sonic game. Gameplay is great, soundtrack is amazing, and the storyline is fun to follow.",,
"This game said there will be SEXUAL CONTENT in the tags before the game released, yet there was no sonic x knuckles cut scene WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ SEGA",,
"It's very good. Bosses go HARD. Game does have a lot jank however, so your enjoyment may vary.",,
"I'm a very long time Sonic fan, lived all the ups and downs this series and this character had, and I think there's no other better way to start this review other than saying that this game, and its reception as a whole, literally brings tears of joy to my eyes... with that said, I hope you're ready for a whole essay about why you should try this.

Well maybe let's start form the obvious, the open world. There's so much catching your attention on the map, you step into a spring and suddenly find yourself exploring a bunch of new routes you just found. The map is well designed and connected, everything links, leading you to new puzzles collectibles etc, it's honestly hard to go straight to the objective. The freedom you have to make your own route, collect what you want to collect, it's just so great. Sonic's abilities makes it fun to explore, the map uses the most of them to test your reaction times and perception, awaiting you with a fine prize at the end, be it a collectible a new puzzle. Difficulty progression is also very palpable, exploring the first island is a breeze compared to, let's say, facing the challenges and reactions from third island.

Sonic's physics play very smoothly, they were tweaked for better fitting into the open world, and it works pretty well. I do may have to warn you though that the cyberspaces will feel a bit slower and/or stiffer than you might be used to from past games, Sonic's not as nimble to tear through a platforming stage. I'm not saying it's bad, not at all, just a heads up you might want to get a bit used to it.

I really don't think I need to say the soundtrack slaps because Sonic is known for that, but yeah. It has a bit of everything, from calm piano to hard headbanging metal. Just go listen to ""Undefeatable"" on Sonic's official Youtube channel, you'll get a glimpse of how hard it goes.

Combat is extremely simple, to the point you can automate it fully to mash a single button, and while that may sound boring it doesn't kill at all the fun of fighting. Normal world enemies are easy to take care of, but fighting guardians is super fun and gives you a threatening energy whenever you meet a new one for the first time. And I don't even know where to start about the titans, holy moly the battles are just so epic... No elaborating here though, too much spoiler if I do.

By the time I write this I'm not completely done with the story yet, but I believe to be about 80% of it. It has been one of the most elaborate and meaningful stories I can remember of a Sonic game, the amount of depth sentiment and feeling put into Sonic and every other character is so fresh, but yeah of course there's some comedy and silliness, wouldn't be a Sonic game without it, and it directly links to past stories, it's a great step into fixing the loose ropes these games left. Super Sonic and the Chaos Emeralds are all once again important and meaningful to the story, which is something we've been pleading for.

Fishing is the main side activity in Frontiers (which also means Big the Cat is back!), it's calm and simplistic, and rewards you with useful extras for your adventure. I know, you may have nightmares from fishing in SA1 but worry not it's simple enough here.

If you're a Sonic veteran you may find the cyberspace level designs very familiar, you'll definitely recognize a few. You maybe can call that lazy, but I do believe that's all intentional since the cyberspace is connected to memory thingies on the plot, in which I shall not elaborate for no spoilers.

Now, surely there would be a few negatives since this is their first shot at a completely new formula, and I think the first one I can talk about is the performance being unstable. It's not greatly optimized so it may require you an okay PC to run at a satisfactory graphic-FPS rate, I wouldn't trust the minimum requirements too much. Also framerate seem to be a bit inconsistent, at some times it'll tell you like 40FPS but feels like 20. Graphics customization is also lacking, having pretty much only high and low, so you may have less liberty at tweaking your settings if you're searching for a good balance between visuals and performance (even though in my opinion both performance and graphics barely change from low to high)

There's also an issue of environmental pop-ups being constant, suchs as rocks, trees, vegetation as a whole, etc. I can't say it personally bothers me that much, but it's definitely something to improve. I can't say I've noticed important assets not rendering though, such as speed pads, springs, rails etc, this problem sticks to vegetation and environment alone, so it's not really going to break your gameplay only your graphics.",,
amazing game just wish they could re release sonic heroes,,
"idk how to explain the music but, do you remember that feeling you got when you were a kid doing the last boss of adventure, adventure 2, or whatever game you remember fondest? yeah I got a lot of that.

10/10",,
best sonic game in years,,
i like this concept of having a fishing competition against an unknown threat,,
"My favorite 3D Sonic game since Sonic Adventure 2. Make sure you switch to Hard before you get the last few Chaos Emeralds on the fifth island so you can fight the real final boss. Also, do boost jumps off of upward-angled rail grinds for hilarious and fun momentum launches. And if you want insane speed during Cyberspace levels, do a homing attack on an enemy and then do an air dash before actually impacting them. Have fun and go fast!",,
"Sonic Frontiers is not the best Sonic game by any means but its also not the worst too. Best Sonic game since Sonic Generations or Sonic and the Black Knight

+ gameplay himself Open Zone is not to bad (to collect all stuff can be boring if you dont really enjoy the gameplay to much)
+ story is alright (characters are finally normal again not like the 2010s era) not the best sonic story also not the worst i would say its the best story since Sonic and the Black Knight
+ enemies are fun to fight
+ big is back you can go fishing again
+ Guardians are the best thing about this game same for the Titans
+ arcade mode easy to replay the Cybersapce stages
+ some creative puzzle even its almost the same again and again
+ music can be good if it want like World 5 all cyberspace levels/ Guardians(/ open zone music
+ story mini games can be fun
+ cyloop is a fun new abillity for sonic here
+ multi save files (3) make a return after a long time since the original Sonic Colors

- graphics can be look alright like in nightime with rain or mostly Chaos Island and Ouronos Island but overall the graphics are not the greatest in the open zone (the first one in daytime have weird lighting)
- cybperspace phyics are stiff
- more playable characters would be nice like Tails, Knuckles and Amy could play her own Open zone Island would make the game less respective
- cyberspace stage design is worse sometimes it feels like Lost World all over again (also way to short like Sonic Forces)
- mostly puzzles are way to easy for the time limit
- World 1,3 and 5 uses the same assets
- pop in stuff (draw distance is awful here)
- only 4 themes for cyberspace stages Green Hill, Chemical Plant and Sky Santuary again
- stiff cutscenes animations in the open zones you can notice this mostly in Chaos Island and Ouranos Island
- red rings are way to easy to get because of the easy level design
- The End true finally boss is a little boring not a typical Sonic thing
- no intro and lazy/bad menu background

Even with so many negative thing in this game i still could find some fun with this game. Its soild a 7/10",,

No but seriously this game is really fun and definitely worth a try if your interested, A lot of love went into this game.",,
"Most people who played Sonic as children are adults now, and this is a well-made Sonic game both children and adults can enjoy.

Gameplay is very smooth and exactly how i wished playing as Sonic would be, since I didn't particularly enjoy how flat and repetitive his gameplay was before, yet, he was the only playable character in modern games. Boss fights are also never like before, in a good way, and mini bosses too are incredibly fun to fight.

Game is very long if you wish to explore your island completely and upgrade your abilities as much as you can before moving on to the next one. It took me around 40 hours to beat the game by fully exploring islands during main story in hard mode, and I recommend you to do the same because I never got bored or felt the urge to move on to the next island. Exploring is very much fun.

The story isn't overwhelming for adults unlike previous titles where the story about a running blue hedgehog was taken way too serious. But this one is away from reality and aware of it.

10/10",,
"(Spoiler Free, TLDR at the end) After 35h and 100% the game here's what I think:

First thing to know is, even though it wasn't marketed as one, this game is a collectathon, if you go into it expecting something else, you might be disappointed (my case).

Is this a good Sonic game? Absolutely. Is it a good Action/Adventure Open-World game? Not really.
Don't get me wrong, it's fun, but after the first 10h it'll stop being fun to being EXTREMELY repetitive.
The story isn't bad, it has a mature feel to it, which I like, but the actual story sequences and cutscenes are very few and far between, the soundtrack is also really good.

The areas are pretty (although very simple, except for a couple landmarks there's not really anything to write home about), but very empty, there's only some small courses for short platforming sections, items to collect and enemies (which have a decent variety to them to be fair), the game tries to justify this emptiness with some lore but it's really just an excuse, the courses don't feel organic to the areas at all, it's clear they were placed there in a very arbitrary way.

There's also the issue with the Pop-Ups, a lot of time these courses and platforms won't even load until you're right in front of them, which for a game about going fast is a big issue.

The controls feel very good (played with controller) I recommend playing on High-Speed mode with all the speed settings turned up. The combat is fun enough, specially the bosses, which contain some fun mechanics to defeat them.

All of this sounds like I hated the game, but the truth is that it has some charm, and clearly does something right If It kept me engaged for 35h and made feel like I wanted to 100% it.
But it is absolutely not worth 60€, I think a price of 30€ would be much more fair for a game of this quality, ultimately your choice will probably come down to: if you like Sonic you'll probably like this game, if not then you probably won't.

TLDR: Good Sonic Game, Mediocre Game overall",,
"My favorite part was when Sonic said ""It's Frontiers time!"" and Frontier'd all over those Eggman's robots.",,

"Review by Gaming Masterpieces - The greatest games of all time on Steam.

Is this game a masterpiece? YES, it is quite an impressive game with a lot of content. One of gaming's most iconic characters is back. The world's fastest hedgehog delights us with a new adventure. While his last adventure (Sonic Origins) was just a pricey remaster of Sonic's first games, this game brings completely new content, and a lot of it. And it is good stuff. A 3D platformer, highly playable, and especially with one thing that is the trademark of the Sonic franchise: it is FAST. It is not so easy to develop a game that is lightning fast and still very playable, but this one gets it right.

Sonic, Tails and Amy get sucked into a strange, digital world. Their archenemy Dr. Robotnik may have something to do with it, as always. Sonic gets seperated from his friends - and only he can set everything right again. He has to explore the Starfall Islands, which offer a large playing field, kind of an open world although you need to collect keys to unlock new parts. This is something completely new for a Sonic game - exploring multiple large islands, fighting different enemies inclding various bosses, collecting a lot of different stuf, solving puzzles, upgrading Sonic, there is even a story to follow. Actually this part of the game plays more like a classic 3D platformer than a Sonic game, although it is full of typical Sonic parkours with rails to slide on, hoops to jump through, springs to boost him across the world. It is quite easy to control Sonic - run around, double jump or just press RT to boost, and Sonic really speeds away when you do that. Attack with a homing attack to kill enemies and collect skill points - which can be used to learn new abilities. There are a lot of things to collect, like Seeds of Power that make you stronger or Seeds of Defense to make you sturdier. Sonic can dodge and can lock on enemies - but to be really master the game, there are far more special moves to learn. Chain combo attacks, wallrun, jump in the air, boost and attack at the right time, create Medusa rings around nasties... there are quite a bunch of abilities to unlock and moves for the player to master. Just running and jumping is not enough. Complete challenges to unlock new parts of the map. Defeat guardians - especially strong enemies - to get their Portal Gears wich you require to unlock new levels.

Additionally to all the things that you can do on the islands, there are also the signature Sonic levels. Here Sonic has to do what Sonic always does - run fast and collect golden rings. Hit an enemy or a spike and you come to an abrupt stop and all your collected rings scatter. You always have to decide if you want to reach the level exit as fast as possible, or to collect as many rings as you can. There is often more than one route to take and you have to decide - run through a speed booster or slide along a rail? Take a detour to get ab extra bunch of rings? Search for the hidden red rings? Your aim is to stay alive and reach the level end as fast as possible and with as many rings as possible. A result screen at the end shows you exactly how fast you were and how many rings, including the rare red rings, you have been able to collect. These classic Sonic levels can be accessed from the large island maps as soon as you have enough Portal Gears to unlock them.

Current technology with high screen resolutions makes it easier to race around at ultrafast speed and still see your sourroundings before you crash into it. You had to learn the level layout in the older games because it was simply impossible to react fast enough if you were running at full speed. Knowing the level layout is still essential to reach a high score in this game, but at least it is easier now because you can see larger parts of the levels. Sonic comes with two difficulty settings and perfect gamepad support. There are training sequences while loading new levels, you can train as long as you want and continue with the main game as soon as the new level is loaded. I won't say the graphics are extremely beautiful, because, well, I think this is a great game, but certainly not a gorgeous one. The story is told in cutscenes... and there are far more and longer story sequences than I have expected to see in a Sonic game.


A 3D platformer with a large world and a lot of things to explore, a real story(!), and including the trademark Sonic levels to race through as fast as possible.",,

THIS SH*T IS SO FIRE I LOVE IT",,
"It's actually pretty fantastic in a surprising way

If you are expecting Mario Odyssey levels of polished combat OR Breath of the Wild levels of open world content nooked around an open world that looks well realized, well, it's not quite there but it doesn't miss the mark by much at all. (The switch framerate doesn't really help those two titles and it's pretty dang fluid on my 3060.

The boss battles could work more fluidly and have you clambering up their bodies more easily. The vertical wall run panels are a little fidgety. Overall the pacing from moment to moment and gameplay balancing has been commendable. The sky might be filled with rails and jump pads, but scouring the land and collecting things is a joy. Very few interactive parts of the environment feel incongruent with how you want to play and experience the game. Gotta go fast is the name of the game, and they don't hold you back. Combat encounters feel challenging and require some thought, but also demand your reaction times and fast inputs, just like the rails in the sky that hold many collectibles and smaller challenges.

One of the greatest parts of the game are the named levels you will teleport to with really creative aesthetics. Each level presents 4 different goals with a progression key rewarding each objective. Speed (with a gold medal to hit), Rings quota, 5 Red Coins, and Completion I think? These levels are meant to be replayed and shine when doing so. By the fourth one the paths had really gotten complicated and I enjoyed running some speed trials to get the gold medal. It's a nice departure, just like the occasional fishing stop. When the game slows down and isn't showing you prerendered cutscenes it can really look beautiful. The detail and sheen on the character models in particular really sells the look.

I'm looking forward to playing this one out over a couple of months when I feel the need for speed. I was happy to grab it at $60 using profits from my Steam Market sales, but I would say $40 is a fair price. It's not going to be the game of the year, but it is pretty damn fun. I think they really did it here. The concept absolutely works, better than it does for Mario in Odyssey. There isn't much to complain about if you're trying to have fun with this game. If you wanted to be hyper critical of every aspect, you'd find cracks. Truly if the devs have another shot at one of these with a little more time and budget the sequel could be a lot of people's GOTY. This is a solid 7.5/10 if the pacing stays consistent enough.",,

What if Sonic Frontiers Went Full Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance

Sega actually had the balls to try something new with Sonic and it definitely delivered. There were some hiccups like bugs, low key bad controls, camera being wonky at times. But MAN, Haven't had this much fun since Sonic Adventures 2 & Sonic Generations! the positives overwhelmed the few negatives. Gameplay is highly addictive and for The story, atmosphere, and the bosses are stunning. what I loved the most are Cyber Missions, they are mashup between 2D/3D sonic stages and compared to open zones can be slow but still feels good ol' classic Sonic so cant complain much.

Don't even get me started with the bosses. Backed up with the most epic metal music and you'll feel like a god wrecking Titans.

for new and old players! the recent updates gave this game more content to do such as New Game+ (with added new difficulty Extreme), Battle Rush, and Koco Challenges. Also, playable characters as well like Amy, Knuckles, and Tails!

Shoutout to my close friend for gifting this on Christmas, you know who you are ;)",,
"The only real complaint I have with Sonic Frontiers is that there is no option to refight the Titans, which are the sickest and best Super Sonic bosses of the whole franchise.

Sonic Frontiers, after so many years, finally brings back the heart and soul of the pre-Sonic Colors games, and man, it's such a breath of fresh air. I can say without question that this is one of the best Sonic games I've played to date, if not one of the best SEGA games I've played period. The fact this game can go from the most hype vocal tracks in the series and feature lo-fi beats to fish to and have all of it work is proof of this soundtrack's quality, too.

A lot of people compare this game's open-world structure to Breath of the Wild, but as someone who's played BotW, I think that game walked so Frontiers could run. Sonic's speed allows him to traverse these massive landscapes with a quick jog and that's so refreshing and allows for seamless gameplay instead of needing to open a map and fast travel everywhere all the time, though that option does exist if you wish to use it, too! I can say wholeheartedly if you've been unhappy with the direction of the games from the Colors to Forces era, you'll be quite happy with Frontiers. Sonic and his friends are back to being themselves and are better than ever, everyone.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go listen to the Titan boss themes, most notably, Find your Flame, another 500 times.

"The best Sonic game since Generations!

Oh boy, this one might be one of the worst first impressions ever received throughout the entire internet and I'm truly grateful that this game wasn't reviewbombt upon release, even if there are still a lot of problems.

story
It's a platformer, so I don't wanna talk too much about the story. All I can say is, that this one here might be the best story ever written in a sonic game. They tried to tell a more darker story with many serious friendship speeches and...
Yeah, I get it, it's still very edgy, but I think they did a lot better than in it's predecessor, sonic forces. The new character, Sage, might have a bit of a stereotypical design but her character arc was well written imo, even sonics sidekicks since they got a bit more depth, like Amy and Tails and even Eggman (Knuckles was the same es ever tho).
Even Sonic wasn't on a snooze cruise, I guess and didn't throw in too many jokes as a comic relief which would have killed the more serious mood.

gameplay
The game is divided into 2 main parts. The open world and the Cyberspace, which are basically the classic sonic stages.
The ""open zones"" are basically huge level with a lot of different platforming challenges. They are working fine enough even though it's not good to look at (more about that later). It's pretty satisfying being able to perform well timed jumps from high above to skip some of the challenges, but I'm not sure if thats intentional. They removed some shackles from the release version to make the movement customizable and more engaging, but I think they might have broken some aspects here and there and made some of these challenges trivial. But all in all, I had a lot of fun doing 100%.
The cyberspace level on the other hand were very dissapointing. They are all rip offs of old level and it felt tedious to do them due to it's redundance (there are only 4 skins pasted all over them). So yeah, It's the weakest part of the main game for me.

This one has it's ups and downs. Music-wise they are either complete hype or forgetabble. The best ones are no doubt the titan fights and the lyric songs in general. The open zones are average, they tried a calmer approach which doesn't really suit sonic tbh. The cyberspace ones are straight up forgetabble or bad. I think they should have re-used the themes of the stages they are based on, I mean if you already copying the level design, you can do the same for the music, don't you?
The aesthetics are also weird. They put sonic into realistic environments with flying platforms, rails and such, which doesn't align with the cartoony sonic figures. There is also very ugly pop in, which could be easily fixed if there was some kind of fade effect. I mean the main theme is the cyberspace, why aren't the platforms coming in with some kind of pixelisque effect?
I mean it's not as uncanny as sonic '06 but still not good to look at.

Well, since this one was part of some free updates, I don't wanna be too harsh on that, but oh boy some of these challenges are just awful to play.
Now we have 3 more playable characters, but they only differ slightly from sonic. But all of these new moves are either overpowered or debuffs/useless. Tails for example has some kind of move where he's able to fly all over the map without any limits whereas he can skips almost all jumping challenges. Knuckles on the other hand has his iconic glide, but whenever you're starting to do that, there is a long starting animation with terrible controls
But even sonic has his down parts. There are some tower challenges which are straight up impossible to do them normally (on hard difficulty), because you need a very specific strategy which are difficult to come up by yourself. Some other challenges on the other hand are way too easy with more than a whole minute remaining time at the end. So yeah, it's pretty unbalanced with random difficulty spikes (don't wanna talk about the ridiculously insane damage the field bosses can make, since I ignored them as much as possible >_>).

Well, this was a lot of backlash now, I know, but I can still recommend this game if you want a new sonic game. But I would suggest grabbing this on sale, because there are indeed some downer here and there, which can put you off. But most of them are part of the artistic choices, gameplay-wise it's an enjoyable experience with a lot of room for improving in future entries.",,
One of the best 3d platform games I ever played! Well worth the purchase,,
game is so hype i turned into sonic,,
"Every world has its end. I know that's kinda sad, but...That's why we gotta live life to the fullest in the time we have.",,
"Wonky in some places and dips a bit in the middle but raw as hell in all the other places.

Loved it",,
"Running around at high speed and rules of natureing the bosses with amazing soundtracks is pretty sick ngl.

But this game is very very easy even on Hard difficulty, since you can level up insanly fast. For example I was only at the second map and I was already almost maxed out with everything and all I did was exploring and little bit of fishing lol.

Oh and the game is pretty short for a 60€ game imo. Go get it when it's on sale.

Overall 7/10",,
"Finally, a good one",,
Best Sonic game since Sonic Adventures. Really hope they keep this direction in the future.,,
"+ Somewhat mixes Boost/Adventure styles with the open zones, competent execution with potential
+ Plenty of rewarding platforming skips avaible for seasoned platformer enjoyers
+ The story/writing, for the first time in 10 years, has actual writers
+ My boi finally gets some more action besides homing attack spams
+ For a first try at a collectathon, very lineant and open with routes to necessary tings
+ Lots of fanservice; music, canonization and refferences to/from past games
+ My actual daughter Sage is so precious

- The combat skills are annoyingly cutscene-y and automated, even Heroes had smoother combat bro
- FワCK whoever designed Chaos Island, unless you see LITERALLY no other way
- ST just gave up trying to make decent physics (Specially in Cyberspace and 2D), do it yourself idiot
- Cyberspace is past Boost games' levels if they were missing 80% of the length and played like rubbish
- Cyberspace aesthetics get old REALLY quick
- Just Cyberspace in general, literally just play any other Boost game instead bruv
- DENUVO, SEGA u just tanking the perfomance for proper owners wdf r u doing

As long as you keep the minus' in mind, its still; in classic Sonic fashion; overall a good game, just with a lot of room for further improvement",,
"The problem with the people who play Sonic is that they're never happy. No matter what you give them, the find a way to complain loudly and openly about it....even if it's the best game the series has gotten in years.

Is it perfect? Heavens, no. There's a lot here that won't appeal to some people, especially if its your first Sonic game. As a long time fan however, this game brings everything I've wanted and more to the table. From the sense of speed, to the exhilirating soundtrack, to the constant challenges of skill to the bombastic boss fights, the game checks every box I have. On top of it all, the game brings humanity to a villain used primarily for comic relief up to this point and has what is hands down Mike Pollock's best performance as Eggman to date.

Stop reading other peoples' reviews and opinions and experience it for yourself. Don't worry about whether it's ""good"" or not: see if you have FUN with it. I certainly did.",,
"I feel like the game isn't so bad so don't really take my review to heart, but it's just how I generally feel about this.

Just to say some positive things about this game before I actually go into why I can't recommend it, I do think they legitimately listened to the fans and worked on the problems they had with previous games, also, I'd say movement in this game is fun, however...

While they worked on the old problems, they created new ones.
The main problem I have with this game is how empty it feels, I might be wrong because I couldn't bring myself to finish it, but there are only 7 (maybe 8) actual characters in the entire game (not counting the Koco obviously).
You spend most of the game running around in a pretty much empty world solving puzzles with no actual difficulty whatsoever, and please keep in mind that the world is bloody huge. The puzzles are also very repetitive and get tiring real quick.

Combat in this game is dumb honestly, they tried to do something new by adding special moves sonic can do, there are a lot of moves but they mainly just do one thing, and that is damage, therefore, what's the point of so many moves if they basically all do the same thing? no clue... you end up just using the best move over and over, and it doesn't help that most moves trigger a sort of a cutscene that just makes things very slow.

Last thing I wanna mention is the Cyber Space levels (if you don't know, basically they are levels that are separated from the open world taking place in areas from previous games which are mostly just green hill for some reason), they are such a pain in the ass to go through, you have to go through a fairly long loading screen to get there, and pretty much every level can be beat in less than 2 minutes. The levels also feel very slow and heavy compared to moving in the open world (which is probably because they're super short so you can't just breeze through them in seconds).

With everything said, I don't think it's such a horrible game, I would say however that it is not worth the price for what you're getting. It might feel like there's a lot of content to it, but it's just an illusion that's created with all those repetitive puzzles.",,

"A marginal step in the right direction.
Don't play Final Horizon unless you want to rip your hair out.",,
"probably the best sonic game we got in a while

PD: after 100% completing the game i can confirm this game is just full of amazing references for sonic fans and the gameplay even tho it can be slighty janky in some areas, this is by far the best we control we got for sonic in a while this is easily for me a 9.0 sonic game",,
"Seriously, if you're on the fence about this game, just buy it. It's well worth the price. I honestly don't understand some of the negative reviews online about this game - even being heavily critical it's no less than a 7/10. It's good. No, it's GREAT. Personally, I would give Sonic Frontiers a solid 8/10. Here are some of my more in depth thoughts after about 18 hours of game play.

I'd like to start by saying I've enjoyed every second of this game so far, and at 18 hours in, I'm only about 75% finished with the story. No rushing and no completion pursuing - this is just from playing at my own pace on normal difficulty. Sonic Frontiers presents an enjoyable balance of 3d Sonic and 2d Sonic game play as well as a good mix of open zone exploration and typical Sonic style levels. There are even some fun mini game challenges including fishing levels, mini bosses, and other challenges that suit the theme of each chapter of the story. Each open zone functions as a sort of hub world for the more typical Sonic levels. This allows you to approach them at your own pace and in which ever order you decide. In the open zones you'll find collectibles and storyline prompts that loosely guide you through the area. This is all done very well and in a way that swiftly endears you to each of the characters. The story even features some well written character development for the characters and zone exploration features some random dialogue prompts that long time fans of the Sonic Comics may enjoy. Overall it's an enjoyable and fun experience that's well worth the price tag even after only 75% completion. Seriously, the music is phenomenal and the fishing mini game is a good time, try it if you buy!

There are some flaws worth noting. The first of which is that there are only two graphics settings available - low and high. In addition, there is some minor pop in that doesn't really affect game play. As a PC gamer this was a little disappointing, but it's also something that's easily patched or even modded by the community. The controls are perfectly fine in both zones and levels, however there can be some awkward moments that may lead to a mistake or two. I tend to call these ""Sonic what are you doing"" moments as it's often just a good laugh. This wasn't detrimental to the overall experience though and didn't distract from the enjoyment of the game. The open zones are great, beautiful and have some interesting variety, but a little empty in certain spots. These areas aren't horrible but could be a little disappointing when you discover a cool looking location only to find no real point of interest there. It's not a perfect game, but it's an excellent start to a new direction for the Sonic franchise. Not only is Sonic Frontiers a game worth buying as is but it's also laying the groundwork for something truly excellent which is exciting to see after several Sonic games that fell flat.

I've seen a lot of people attempting to compare this to LoZ Breath of the Wild. If you're looking for BoTW 2 then wait for Nintendo to release it. This isn't that. The open zone format is more aptly compared to something like Pokemon Arceus and the world/enemy design is much more similar to the first Xenoblade Chronicles - with one boss so closely resembling a Mechon that it's kind of uncanny.

I can't wait to see where the Sonic Franchise goes from here, but why are you still reading this? Buy it already! Or if you already have then go play it! Just don't be surprised when you surface hours later only to realize you've just sunk 6 hours into a Sonic game in one go. A SONIC game? Yeah, that's right, it's that good.",,
"No one reads the reviews, so I will write that I am gay.",,
game doesnt open after latest update,,
"This is an *extremely* unpolished step in the right direction. It feels like a significant amount of testing and focus group feedback went into the first area, as it felt /amazing/. As the game progresses, that sense continues to wane with some jankiness that ends up preventing proper mobility. If the game could feel like it did in the first area, this would be an easy 8.5/10. However, as it is, this is closer to a 6/10. What it does good, feels freaking amazing. When the new mechanics don't feel good, it can be enough to make you want to put down your controller.

Sonic has four stats, which must be leveled up as you progress through the game. Strength, defense, speed and ring cap. The first two level up at a fairly decent rate by finding items out in the field, primarily dopped either within boxes or by enemies that you encounter naturally on your way. The latter two are raised by collecting a single resource (some not-quite-chao lifeforms) and deciding which stat you wish to turn it into. Unlike the first two, this is not a 1:1 ratio. Starting into the third map, my first two stats are just under 50 while the latter are at 25 and 5 respectively. As a result, I have to question if it's this comparitively low level of speed that makes it feel as though the boost mechanic isn't doing much of anything unless I'm on a rail.

On note of the boost mechanic, I feel like I'm actively getting punished for using it more than half the time as it will either send me flying off the map, or a rail, or launch me into a mechanic to make me traverse backwards. This feels like a major disconnect for a franchise revolving around ""gotta go fast.""

The writing is... Surprisingly decent. While there are some obvious repetitive cutscenes to skip (entering/leaving a stage, depositing resources, collecting an emerald), I'd recommend /not/ skipping the story cutscenes.

The music is great, and harkens back to some of the pre-Crush40 days with a more modern feel. The overall soundtrack has somewhere around 150+ songs, so there's plenty of decent variety.

Amidst the open-world areas, are stages that can't seem to decide if they want to be more like it was in Generations; some feel more 'Classic', some feel more 'Modern', some are... A strange hybridization between both. Completing objectives in these levels unlocks vault keys, which you need to gain emeralds. However, the weight of the objectives feels slightly off. Each stage has a rank based on nothing but your time to get through it, all other objectives be damned. While there is one objective to get a high rank, and stages can be repeated without penalty to get the other objectives, it just feels bad when you've gone out of your way to get the other objectives completed and feel like you're being punished for it with an otherwise low rank because you had to spend a few seconds here and there doing something. Additionally, there doesn't seem to be a wide variety of stage themes. Mostly I'm seeing references to Green Hill Zone and Sky Sanctuary (in the case of 90% of these so far), but there are occasionally other references thrown in such as Chemical Plant Zone.

Big the Cat is back, and so is fishing, but it actually feels like it has some amount of use. Sonic's the one fishing, and you can use this to /drastically/ reduce the amount of resource farming on your current map. It's also used to unlock a fast travel mechanic between resource deposit sites, so it's best not to ignore.

The graphics are gorgeous. There's also a large sense of scale making it feel somewhere between Breath of the Wild and Shadow of the Colossus.

The camera locking is excessive and will lead to your death, if not a sense that you have none of the freedom they've tried to give you. The third island in particular seems to be the biggest culprit of this so far.

Grab it for the story, the graphics, and those moments where they've truly done something right. Just be prepared to take breaks.",,
"With each new gameplay video and trailer that came out to the public, I became more and more excited for Frontiers, even stating that it could be the best 3D Sonic game since Generations. And after completing the whole game, I can confirm that Sonic Frontiers is the best 3D game in years. The open zone formula works whilst still retaining the boost mechanic that's been around since 2008 in Unleashed. Being able to do platforming and grinding on rails on the islands is a lot of fun and creative on how you can traverse instead of just boosting around. The combat is fun to perform and its cool to pull sweet combos on enemies. Whilst the attacks you can learn are not as expansive as I expected, it gives enough variety to use instead of just using the same attack over and over again. Enemy variety is great, allowing you to explore new ways to attack each enemy, especially when you face stronger types and have to change your approach of engagement. The Titan Bosses you face as Super Sonic are some of the best the franchise has had in so long, some even better than previous Final Bosses in previous games. And the music choice for them are amazing.

The soundtrack is a banger, ranging from different genres of music. Quite possibly, this is Ohtani's best work as the main composer for the franchise, and it has paid off so well. Dare I say, it is one of, if not the best soundtrack of the franchise, up against Jun Senoue's SA2 soundtrack. The optional Cyberspace Levels (yes, they are OPTIONAL, but let's face it, its the quickest way to progress through the game) are fun and can add replayability, since some are short and encourage you to improve your times. Majority of them are reused level design from previous games (split into 3D and 2D only sections, depending on if you like to see them again or not), but they are also original level design Cyberspace Stages which are, in my opinion, the best levels in the game, alongside a few of the SA2 Cyberspace stages, which work incredibly well, and wished there were more of them.

The story is a nice fresh breath of air, thanks to Ian Flynn as the writer. There is way less corny lines and bad jokes and more focus on characterisation, which is great to see, showing off character's past adventures and motivations, including connections to previous games, and not in a forced ""easter egg"" way, which feels natural and flows very well. I will admit that the game as a whole is not perfect, as Frontiers does have a few issues that can drag it down for some players and hardcore fans, such as the sudden pop in with the many platforms and rails in the sky, and how the process of leveling up can be super tedious (looking at your Elder Koco). Majority of the puzzles are very easy to complete, especially how very forgiving the timer allows you to complete them.

Despite that, the pros outweigh the cons for me and I enjoyed the hell out of this game. Sonic Frontiers is now my favourite Sonic game of all time, just beating Sonic Unleashed (PC port of Unleashed WHEN?). This is a very different kind of Sonic game that we've had in the past and Frontiers is the start of a new direction for the blue blur, and I'm all in for it. I look forward to what Sonic Team does with this formula and see what gets improved on.",,
"the soundtrack is god tier.............
the gameplay, REFRESHING
the bosses are super unique and grab the player attention all the time.
did i mention my favorite song of all time is from this game. ONE WAY DREAM",,
"It's a very good step in the right direction and does a lot right but also does a lot wrong.
In the open zone controls are really really good, the best Sonic has felt in many years, only problem i have with it is that sonic does not carry forward momentum when he jumps.
Cyberspace takes a bit of getting used to because it is a bit too stiff and sonic is slowed, especially in 2d.
On the note of 2d too many locked 2d sections were placed all over chaos island.
The combat is really fun but attacks are hindered by the cinematic camera, large hitstun and because of how powerful Sonic is in addition to how weak enemies are fights are wrapped up way too quickly.

Every issue i have mentioned thus far has already been addressed by mods so this is the correct version of the game to buy.
One issue the devteam will have to address though is Rhea island and its lack of content, being a long chain of cutscenes broken up by a few 2d rail sections.

oh and tails is in it so its awesome i love tails",,
"Sonic Frontiers can be up and down at times, but most of the game is ups. Sometimes it can feel a bit wonky, but overall, Sonic Frontiers is an incredibly enjoyable experience. Spoilers In terms of the story, this is the first time in a while that these characters actually felt like real characters instead of the Flanderizations they have been before. Sonic isn't just the snarky quipping guy, Tails isn't just the smart one, Amy isn't just the girl who likes Sonic, and Knuckles isn't just a big idiot. They feel like they're actual fleshed out instead of just one note characters. It's one of the best 3D Sonic games I've ever played and I highly recommend it.",,
"Sonic Frontiers has its issues that kinda hampered my experience with it, but I had a fun time overall. With the main game, at least.

I wasn't too big on the story reusing the same structure of 'Sonic loses the emeralds, Sonic has to explore the island to find them again, turn Super Sonic for the big boss battle', but I did like the moments he shares with his friends trapped in cyberspace. Tails is my favourite Sonic character, so I especially enjoyed seeing the writers course-correct his character, especially after how he was treated in Forces.

It was cool to explore my surroundings and see what I could find, although the occasional pop-in can make getting some collectables tricky, especially in the later islands. When completing challenges that open the map, the game doesn't unveil whole chunks at a time but rather smaller scattered tiles that aren't even next to each other most of the time, which I thought was a bit messy.

The combat can be fun and flashy, but don't go into this game expecting something like Devil May Cry. One thing to note is that the parry is very busted in the main game because you can hold it for as long as you want and any attack that connects will be parried. This would change in Final Horizon and I think I do prefer it that way because it actually feels like a proper parry that needs to be timed! Another minor thing is that you can't open the map while in combat. I understand that you can just run away until the game no longer considers you as part of combat, but it was still an odd decision that bothered me when in the moment I just wanted to plot a course to leave for somewhere else when I couldn't be arsed to fight.

I thought the main game was a bit on the easy side even on the Hard mode, but Final Horizon changes this significantly. Unfortunately I don't think it was for the better. Some of the challenges that Final Horizon throws at the player made the sometimes janky physics and camera angles even worse, especially the dreaded tower climbs when you get to play as Sonic again. Those sections in particular had my palms all sweaty the entire time!

The Titan boss battles are often considered a highlight of this game for their spectacle and killer music, though my favourite would be Knight because there's a bit more going on mechanically than the other three Titans. The final boss of the main game sees a genre shift that I found to be a bit jarring but still playable. Unfortunately as much as I wanted to like the Final Horizon final boss, I just found it unintuitive and poorly designed at points. Those trees really get in the way too! What were they thinking?

I came out of the main game pretty satisfied with my experience, and that's why I'm still giving Sonic Frontiers a recommendation. I would later come out of Final Horizon kinda frustrated but also relieved that the whole thing was finished. It is optional content, but tread carefully if you're at all curious about it.",,
"It's kinda like a bigger, modern gen Sonic Adventure/2 game with some Sonic Generations mixed in. At first I wasn't sure if I liked it but I can say now that it's pretty fun and one of the better Sonic games I've played in a long time, as someone that played the 16-bit versions as a kid. I actually on play mouse and keyboard, which surprisingly works pretty well despite the traditionally bad camera that comes with all 3d Sonic games. Soundtrack is dope, especially the mission/zone tracks. I got this as a gift and I'd recommend buying it on sale if you're interested.",,

"has a considerable amount of jank, and lacks polish in some areas, but overall feels great to play. the open zone platforming challenges, for as unnatural as they look in the photo-realistic environments, feel extremely natural in practice and allow for satisfying exploration and traversal. the more traditional cyberspace levels have a nice bite-size feel to them, the longest they take is maybe 2 mins and you're back in the overworld. the super sonic boss battles are incredible and i wish there were more. frontiers' story is also the best i've seen in a sonic game and the characters feel alive. overall my only real complaint with the game is the pop-in. it will only load small sections of long platforming bits and it can be tough to find where they begin at times, kinda hope it gets fixed in a patch or something because it's pretty jarring when running around the world. looking forward to the story dlc later this year!",,
"A step in the right direction with lots of janky moments, but good overall
I am biased towards the boost formula, but I do have to complain about the cyber stages, way too short, Sonic controls are weirder than in the overworld, the red rings are far too easy to collect, and worst of all
Sonic feels slow, not just in cyberspace, but in the entire game, add that to the recicled levels and how repetitive the game is, and this can become a pretty boring experience

But even so, the game is still just fun to play, it still is cool to repeat cyber stages for better runs, the controls in the overworld are pretty good, and this is one of the best sonic stories

With a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending",,
"This one definitely tried something new for Sonic, and I think it did a decent job. It's pretty fun zooming around an open world, and the combat is simple but has depth and fun to it. The worlds are small enough that they don't feel too cluttered nor too empty.

Pros:

- BEST Bosses in a Sonic game I've ever seen. The Titans may be easy and cinematic, but man are they a fun time, and the music is top notch as always.
- Good sized open world that feels fun to move around in and not be too overwhelmed.
- Simple but fun combat, with a good variety of moves and enemies, including special mini-boss enemies.

Cons:

- The story-forced minigames are all pretty bad, especially the extremely janky pinball game. Some people find it easy, some don't, but I think we can all agree it's trash.
- The Cyberspace levels are the actual linear stages in the game. It doesn't really feel good to go fast in them, and they're more awkward than anything. They're mostly just stages vaguely resembling themes from past Sonic games. Idk but they're not the main attraction here if you're here for standard 3D Sonic levels.

It's weird to put the combat and exploration over the speed/platforming in a Sonic game, but that's what Sonic Frontiers is. A departure of sorts from previous games, but PLEASE just play it for the story/bosses even.",,
"!!WARNING!! THERE BE SPOILERS AHEAD.
Total Score: 9/10

Story: 9.5/10
Gameplay: 8.5/10
Sound/Music: 9.0/10





So; Let's start this out with that I've been a fan of Sonic the Hedgehog since Sonic 2, when I first got into the series back when I was only 5 Year old. Truth be told; I have above and beyond been disappointed in the Sonic series since 06's Release, There were some okay games, and then there was Generations which was really solid. But outside of those the series has been in a downward spiral..

Then I learned of Sonic Frontiers. Ian Flynn was set to write for the game. For those of you who do not know, Ian Flynn is one of the greatest Sonic the Hedgehog writers of all time, having written extensively for the Archie Comic Series, and currently for the IDW Comic Series, both showing his immense understanding of the characters and work. So needless to say, this drove me to have a bit of a higher bar for this game and while the game isn't perfect, hardly any game is, I can say without a doubt that it flew over that bar to the highest point.

I strongly believe this is one of the best stories written in Sonic's game history, the story focuses on the damage done by the previous games to the characters we know and love, allowing us to see them rebuild from the deep dive the last 16 years have done to Sonic and his Friends. It even deep dives into Robotnik, without going into spoiler territory that is practically all I can say about the story. But I loved every moment and was captivated, the only problem I have is that at the very end of the game it strongly feels like the ending is missing a lot and was generally rushed. But that doesn't ruin the rest of the game for me. Sage is a fantastic new character that I can't wait for them to do more with in the coming future.

In terms of gameplay, I think outside of the 2D Sections, the movement is fantastic, the control is phenomenal, and the introduction of the Stat System was a worry, but implemented it very well and negated all worry I had. The games open world is fantastically done, It's not massive, but it's also not empty, like BOTW was. Combat was a little rudimentary, but honestly it didn't detract from the game and I believe that they will improve it more going forward. My biggest issue with the Gameplay is the Stage Selection, while I get the point, the fact that all the stages of the islands are just repeats of Green Hill, Chemical Plant, Sky Sanctuary and City Escape was a little disappointing. But the Open World definitely makes up for that.

Finally; let's discuss the Music and Sound design, First and foremost I am NOT a fan of the Voice Acting in this game, it honestly feels like the VA's were forced to do one take and then go with that take. Roger Craig Smith's new sonic voice was such a shock, it's not BAD, but it's not Sonic. It sounds like he's just doing his normal voice for Sonic. At times you can hear the true Sonic behind his voice, but generally it isn't the Sonic voice we've all come to love. This is generally the same for everyone except for Knuckles and Tails, both of their VAs hit the A+ Mark for their Voices. Now, we'll move into the Music...The Music was pretty hit or miss for the first part of the game, but as you progress in the game the music takes a massive upturn in quality, and I definitely started loving the beats and the Lyrics told a story in and of itself. So generally I can't be to annoyed by the Music.

So I can say happily, that this game is above and beyond the best Sonic game I have ever played, and I want you to know I've played a lot. They stated that this game was intended to work like Sonic Adventure in that they will set the tone and format of the upcoming sonic games for the next decade, and I can say without a doubt that I hold high hopes for everything coming forward. This game has rekindled my love for the Sonic Franchise, and with Ian Flynn heading the writing and development of these characters I can say they are in good hands as long as SEGA doesn't find a way to fudge it up.

Thank you for reading my review, please be sure to buy this game so that SEGA can know this is the quality we want, not the crappy games for the last 16 years (Generations Excluded).",,

"IMO best Sonic game of all time. A blast. It's not perfect, a bit too many unnecessary cutscenes and such, can't get out of the 2D paths when you enter them in the open world, but those are all just minor things. It's not challenging but it's very fun. A refreshing game that actually dares to have fun mechanics in the sea of boring, samey, mediocre AAA releases.",,

"To be honest, I kinda' regret buying this game. Don't get me wrong, it is the BEST Sonic game in recent memory. The world is interesting and beautiful, the plot is alright, gameplay is pretty good. I'd give it an 7.5-8/10. But for 60$, I really don't feel like I got my money's worth. I played through the story, got the secret ending by playing on the highest difficulty, and did pretty much everything I deemed ""Worth doing"", There's just not enough here to justify a 60$ price-point. If it went on sale for like.. 20-30, I'd recommend it then. Otherwise, save your money. There are much better games on Steam. Maybe when they add more content in the near future? For now it's just kinda' meh.",,

"(Revised review, due to me having finished the game.)

If Open Zone is the future of the Sonic series, then I have pretty much not much more interest in this series. Sonic Frontiers is basically a shell of something that could be very good, but it's technical and gameplay problems hold it back for me from truly finding enjoyment out of the game.

The most striking aspect of this game other than the genre shift is the writing, which is leagues ahead of what Ken Pontac and Warren Graff were able to achieve. After decades of bad writing and dialogue, Sonic and his so-called ""stupid friends"" finally feel like themselves again, not only do they patch up some of the rough spots that the previous two writers had left, but also open the doors to many other ideas that could be explored in the series. For the writing alone my opinion of this game is much higher.

However! The actual gameplay is not fun! I don't like open world games to begin with, and I will concede that their solution to it is way more interactive than the usual Ubisoft sludge that gets churned out. Sonic's control in the Open Zone segments of the game is nearly something that I would consider to be enjoyable, but the minute you enter a Cyberspace level it all falls apart. The 2D ones especially feel awful to play.

A lot of the issues I've had seem to stem from how Sonic seems to stick to the ground in the worst situations, and also happens to love to launch himself when you aren't trying to. My Cyloop being interrupted by him flying off of world geometry happened enough that I feel the need to mention it. Pop-in and graphical glitches were also things that annoyed me, I ran into a particular bug that would black my screen completely and I had to reload a previous save to get rid of it.

I will also concede that this review has mainly been positive towards the game, but the issues that I have brought up make it incredibly difficult for me to actually enjoy this game. Pick it up on a sale if you're curious.",,
"It's not the best Sonic game. It's not a good Sonic game. It's not even a good game by almost any standard. This isn't to be contrarian - It's an open world game with no exploration. It's a platformer that does that platforming for you. It's a game that forces you to wait for it to play itself and punishes you if you try to chime in. I love Sonic, but once you get over the spectacle of it, the game itself is painfully lacking.

100% completion took about 22 hours. Of those 22 hours, I'd say maybe 8 are actually physically playing the game.
You will constantly be (literally) railroaded into flashy, quick-cut sections of launching from zipper to spring to homing sequence to rail back to another zipper. It's all meant to be scripted sequences rather than gameplay. But the real problem is that if you even think about touching the joystick, or boosting, or do anything more than that maybe one head-empty input the game wants you to for the duration of it then you are flung wildly off course.
The boss fights are no better. Wait, Parry. Wait. Quick time event. Watch hilariously anime cutscene (can't lie though, they are kinda cool).
The fishing is probably the most fun thing in the game just for how absurd it is, and it is also pressing a single button and waiting.

So far this has all just been spectacle disguised as gameplay, but consider how many outright cinematics you have to sit through - chatting with your friends and the aforementioned DBZ-esque boss scenes. Worse, in order to level up your rings and (ironically) speed you have to spend almost 2 hours of actively waiting and pressing one button to level all the way up after you've collected enough Zelda misfit toys.

Moreover, for being considered an ""open world"" game, 4/5 of the worlds you visit are just clones of each other. You just go from waypoint to waypoint opening up the map that shows you exactly where to go for the other points of interest. There's no sense of wonder - nothing that grabs the eye and rewards your curiosity. You get three monochromatic flavors of worlds: green, orange, and grey, with only the 4th world being unique; and it's the shortest, most narrow one.
Sure, there are beacons indicating where a chaos emerald but they don't serve as visual intrigue, as you're told (via short cutscene) when you're able to retrieve them. Nor do they serve as a guide because again, the waypoints fill out your map for you. The open world aspect is completely oversold and under-delivered. If the only requisite for the genre is ""big map"" then alright, but I'd say that's about as misleading as calling Megaman a third person shooter.
And this is all to say nothing of the mismatched art styles, the half baked story, the brainless combat mechanics.",,
"Genuinely love this game, could probably be one of my favourite sonic games.
Its so close to being an amazing game. But I'm conflicted about the game.

While yes it is jank, the jank is kind of the charm of sonic games. Flinging of the smallest rock, going of the platforms to do platforming, is so fun, which is really where my main enjoyment comes from.

But There is definitely a tone wrong with this game;
- A lot of obstacles are basically just automated
- The story doesnt feel fully baked.
- Amy's character just feels, wrong
- Pop-in is awful
- obstacles are just kind of floating their, which I would be fine with, if they suited their environments
- The combat feels stiff, no move stalling, and sonic locking onto an enemy doesn't flow well.

I'm happy this game exists, because It will hopefully be the pushing point that the series needs to get back to where it was, where everything was crazy awesome bs.",,
"Honorable Members of British Parliament,

I write to you with a report on the recently released video game ""Sonic Frontier,"" a production that I am sorry to say is deeply troubling and potentially dangerous to our cause.

At its core, ""Sonic Frontier"" is a game that glorifies rebellion and insurrection, presenting the player with a protagonist who openly defies authority and seeks to overthrow the established order. The game's graphics and sound design are undoubtedly impressive, but the content of the game itself is highly subversive and should be cause for alarm.

Moreover, I fear that ""Sonic Frontier"" may serve as a rallying cry for those who seek to undermine our efforts and destabilize the region. The game's themes of rebellion and resistance may embolden those who would seek to rise up against the crown, potentially leading to widespread unrest and conflict.

I urge the members of Parliament to take swift action to address this issue, and to consider measures to restrict the circulation of this game among the general populace. It is our duty to protect the interests of the crown and maintain order and stability in the colonies, and ""Sonic Frontier"" is a clear and present danger to these objectives.

Yours most obediently,

Benedict Arnold",,
"what the ♥♥♥♥ happened in update 3?

The Base game, while getting a bit flawed torwards the end was a fun experience. The missfires such as the 4th Islands towers, while annoying, atleast gave you checkpoints letting you overlook it for the most part. The combat was never something outstanding about the game, but i believe it did its job good enough to give the game its own identity,

Now having said that, imagine if they took all those flaws, exaggerated them and then removed the few things making you overlook said flaws. The Tower climbing? its back, but this time with no checkpoints and f the player design sprinkled in to be ""dificult"".

But ok you get over that, what now? Some of the worst challanges thats what. The Trials Sonic goes trough are honestly baffling. The solution for each felt more like cheating than actual intended behaviour. Though I stopped playing on the 5th trial. The Boss rush is actually a joke. I simply cant believe this was playtested at all.

But what about the new characters? In concept theyre great. Each has their own distinct feature, however, due to what i assume can only be lack of playtesting, youre essentially left on your own to figure out what skills are required to actually progress in the story, leading to potentially wasting experience points you grinded for a few 20 minutes if not more. If the required skills were unlocked from the start and the wind up animations werent there id say its a great starting point for future games including these same gameplay styles. Oh and a sidenote, you cant use the jukebox in update 3. Have fun hearing the same song on loop 40 times because you just cant find out what on earth this game expects you to do.

In short, while its great to see more playable characters come back in 3d, the flaws of game design in update 3 honestly bring the experience down a lot. I didnt finish it. I refuse to do that joke of a boss rush.",,

"This game was seriously fun to 100%. If I had to put this, it's right under Sonic Adventure 2 Battle for me. It's my second favorite Sonic 3D game of all-time.

The game has a weird story, but for some reason it's also good. The janky terrain and all the things you can do leads this game into being a chef's kiss from SEGA. I know a ton of people despise this new ""attempt"" they did, but it felt like an alpha/beta type game format testout. Beating the game for 100% was 1 thing, but clearing it at 100% was really a long task that I didn't get bored with.

Can't wait for the next 3D title.",,
"A phenomenal evolution of 3D Sonic's gameplay, with a love-able soundtrack as usual. I'm consistently impressed by the depth of combat, the creativity of the mini-boss encounters, and the over the top spectacle of the boss battles.

Also, for the first time in years, the plot is compelling and well written to make the main story worth paying attention to.

The freeing feeling of running in large open worlds with Sonic is a dream finally realized in this game, and the beautiful visuals of this new place makes every moment a treat. The open zone puzzles and platforming are constantly engaging, making sure there's never a dull moment.

I loved this game from start to finish, with few issues with any of the content at all. Easily one of my favourite Sonic games of all time.",,
"One of the worst games I have ever played. Not really worth talking about, so I am not gonna waste my time. They wanted to create a BOTW Sonic, instead they came up with a school project, so my criticisms wouldn't help this one. It's such a shame how low standards Sonic fans have to like this one. If you want to play a good Sonic game, play Spark the Electric Jester instead. It's a game made by one person that is way better than all Sonic games. Dear SEGA, just delete this franchise because you definitely are not making the effort the Sonic brand deserves.

If you are a Sonic fan you owe it to yourself to play this game, even if you haven't touched the franchise in a while, this is the one to try. This game cemented why Sonic is one of my favorite video game characters/franchises and gives me incredible hope for the direction of the series going forward. The amount of passion and love the devs have for the entire series is clear and on display in this game and it makes me so so so happy to see.

"I have contraversial feelings about this game. Sonic Adventure DX was first my own game 21 years ago on Sega Dreamcast. Sonic Adventure 2 gave me amazing vibes when I played it (around 10 times in my life). I love Sonic, I waited this game like little child waiting for Christmas.

I have made all achievements, finished all levels on S and this makes me happy too

So, what did I get?
[+]Pros
- This is still Sonic the way it should be (character)
- I love other characters and happy they are in the game
- Game lore is amazing, if you didn't know some things about Sonic, it could be hard to understand.
- High speeds, casual combat
- Grind is not annoying
- Easy but very nice puzzles

[-]Cons
- Controls sometimes awful, in open world it is good (not always, look next), but in levels controls feels like Need For Speed, when you rotating character
- Game is not so bright as you can wish, Sonic always was very colorful, but this game most of time feels gray.
- Too many places where you can't change camera from 2d view back to 3d. This was very annoying and you need to run forward or run back to exit this 2.5d view to return to exploration
- UI is very slow, you always need to wait a second or two to continue playing after dialogues, even this thing is in menu. It's okay because there is not so much dialogues, but check next point....
- UPGRADES. Upgrades okay, when you collect seeds, but when you upgrading your RING and SPEED with collected Koco..... You just suffer.

Maybe I forgot something, but I think this is most important things.

I will mark game to recommend, but play if you're really Sonic fan. If you just want to try game for gameplay - this is not the best way..",,
"Mario Odessy formula but with sonic, which is awesome, can't get enough of this one.",,
"Product refunded

Denuvo makes this game run terribly on my PC. Ended up returning it. Remove Denuvo and I'll reconsider buying this.",,
"First off, wow. This game is the best we've gotten in a long time and there is so many amazing things in this game. The story is amazing with sonic and the rest of the characters showing a lot of personality in cutscenes which I haven't really felt since sonic unleashed. The open world has a lot of amazing challenges and theres a lot to do in it, also for those who prefer the more traditional style boost games you have cyberspace which although the stages are old stages instead of new ones, they are still very fun to go through and complete. Also, sonic controls incredibly well in this game and although this game doesn't have much momentum when running around, the trick skill does help with that and adds more to it. There's also a lot to do in the open world with loads of challenges that always give you something to do. And I can't stress this enough, PLEASE Sega make sure the characters keep this personality and care that they have in this game for future games because it really does add a lot to how the game feels. And star fall during the night is a very interesting idea that works very well for how the game is designed and was something I personally loved a lot. And the boss fights, oh. my. lord. the boss fights. these are the best, most hype sonic boss fights we've gotten EVER, and while originally the final boss fight seemed a little anticlimactic, they fixed that with the 3rd update making the coolest sonic boss fight I have ever seen. And I also quite enjoyed a lot of the mini bosses on the island as they all had their own unique parts to them. Overall this game is really amazing and is definitely going to keep me coming back for future sonic games. Now some negatives, while I personally didn't experience this a lot during my playthrough, there were a few points where the 2d segments of the open world felt very hard to move around in and would sometimes shift in and out of being 3d leading to me having to restart it. Also if you enter into some of these 2d sections it's hard to leave some of them and you will have to finish that section to move on. And one more thing, for anyone playing this game for the first time, remember this is a long game and that to really love and enjoy this game you have to stop and smell the flowers, take things slow and actually explore the island. I rushed through the first two and it first felt very boring just because of that, but then I replayed it and fully imersed myself and I enjoyed the game SO much more. Anyways my final score of this game is a very solid 9.5/10 with not a lot of problems after the three updates and I would definitely recommend this game to others.",,
fast,,
"It's still a little rough around the edges but at least for me the good ideas outweigh all the nitpicks, leading to one of the more enjoyable Sonic games, especially compared to the previous mainline installment.",,
"My favorite Sonic game ever. Yes, I do understand that this game has flaws, but I can look past them because this game have so many good things about it that I can overlook the flaws. If you like collect-a-thons, you'll like this game.

The gameplay is just so addicting, and it's very fun to run around the Starfall Islands. This is the number 1 reason as to why I always come back to this game. I can go to this game and have fun with the gameplay, even with the jank. I do wish that there was more to do in Sonic Frontiers like side quests, more collectibles aside from the main ones (vault keys, memory tokens, etc.), and switching characters outside of the ""Another Story"" save file, more costumes for Sonic and his friends, but I can live without it because of the addicting gameplay.

The story isn't bad, but nothing special. I think the best part of the story is the character arcs that Sonic's friends go through.

The combat in my opinion is pretty decent. Sonic has a ton of moves that can take out his enemies. Now, the enemies are REALLY easy to take out on hard mode, so if you want more of a challenge, I suggest the Hedgehog May Cry mod. But hey, combat is flashy and satisfying to me at least.

The Starfall Islands, despite the atrocious pop-in, are fun to explore. I would describe it as a VERY huge sonic level. Speaking of levels... I'll get Cyberspace out of the way! Yeah, Cyberspace is more like the traditional 3d/2d Sonic levels you can play but have 3 returning themes and the levels themselves... well... a lot of old Sonic levels return. Now, despite the returning level themes and design, the thing that brings down Cyberspace are the controls. OMG THE CONTROLS ARE SO GARBAGE!! I would get the Tracker's Physics mod, they make Cyberspace so much better. Btw, Tracker's Physics and Hedgehog May Cry conflict, so either choose one or merge them.

Lastly, the OST is top 3 in the Sonic Franchise. Whatever flaws this game has, you cannot say this game's ost is bad. YOU CAN'T!!! For me, Sonic Frontiers' ost is my favorite. I always listen to it whenever I wanna just jam.

SLIGHT SPOILER IN THIS PARAGRAPH
Sonic Frontiers has a special place in my heart. I was there when it was first announced. It felt great being hyped for a Sonic game. Through its ups and downs during the promotion, it was still a cool experience. This game got me through a tough time during winter 2022, and now I keep coming back to it as it's my comfort game. I played it again tonight on the day before I turn 18 years old, and I finally stopped when I was at Chaos Island, and Sonic said, ""It's going to take some getting used to, but here's to you reaching new heights--partner."" I felt a bit emotional after he said that because I felt like Sonic was talking directly at me. It'll take a bit of time getting used to my life actually beginning and starting to experience new things, but here's to me reaching new heights. I love this game so much.


Ok, so my rating? 8/10. Buy it on sale though, not worth 60$.",,
"This is a fun game, but it's not great and does not deserve the overwhelmingly positive score it currently has. Even from a technical standpoint, the 60 fps cap is terrible and the pop in should be made better with updates, but probably won't be.

If they fixed / enhanced the graphical settings that would go a long way towards improving the game.",,
Why am I doing anything else when I could be playing something actually good like Sonic Frontiers,,
"While this isn't a very hard metric to beat this is without a doubt the best 3D Sonic title in a decade.

The open zone formula is really fun to explore with a new unique combat system for the series and within the zones are cyber-space levels that play more akin to a traditional level you'd expect out of a Sonic game.

But, that is just the icing on the cake ontop of all of this controlling Sonic feels really good and is the best it has felt in a long time, if you're a fan of Sonic i'd absolutely recommend playing this, maybe even if you're not give it a shot?

8/10.",,
"It's a good sonic game, there are some issues but overall it's pretty fun and the world is fun to explore.",,
The best game since SA2 in my opinion,,
This is in the debate for the best Sonic game.,,
"Best Sonic game in years.

Boss-fights are mid, open-world enemies are mid, but the movement is a dream.

The open world stages tap into what made Adventure fun back in the day.
The cyberspace levels are ""run as fast as you can to the exit"" sections from the more recent games.
Not a werehog nor a gun in sight.

You can collect music from old games around the world to dial up the nostalgia to 11.",,
"It's okay. But there isn't a system for reviewing a game as ""okay"".

There is a clear lack of polish and playtesting in pretty much every area of the game. Between the lack of polish and the massive reuse of assets and stage layouts it seems like Sonic Team has gotten good at squeezing the max amount of content out of the minimum amount of budget SEGA will provide them.

On launch day we had mods coming out that fixed some basic issues, and added mechanics people have been begging for for years.

I'm largely skewing this towards negative because of the amount of ""game good"" positive reviews there are.

SEGA keeps getting away with forcing out lackluster products and people just eat it up. I suppose I'm no different by buying it launch day, but the least I can do is post a negative review to balance out the scales.",,
"This game for me so far is amazing, feels so good to play. The open world is a mysterious and filled with puzzles, obstacles, cool enemies and mini bosses, etc. The tone is...somber...and the music matching and I really dig it.

The cyber levels are so great, with *amazing music* and I wish they were a bit longer as they're so fun.

Controlling Sonic feels perfect in this game, just make sure to go into options and crank all the speed and turning options to max.

Visually it looks fantastic to me, I have everything maxed out @ 1440p and runs smooth as butter on my Amd RX 6800 16gb GPU. There is some pop in on the obstacles but it's not annoying in any way.

I'm so impressed with this game, if you like Sonic even a little bit I'm sure you'll love this game. I mostly like the old 2d Sonic games, and I like Adventure 1 & 2...but this game is on a whole different level.

It honestly feels like Sega's answer to Mario Odyssey, the quality of the visuals, the animation, the character control, etc reminds me of Mario Odyssey very much.",,
"Denuvo Anti-Piracy hinders this game immensely and it makes me quite sad. I was looking forward to playing this game a lot, but the screen tearing and performance issues I am having that are CAUSED directly by denuvo anti-piracy make this game unplayable.

I'd say I hope the devs remove it but I don't think that will happen so uh just beware Denuvo if you plan on getting this game and do your research before hand.",,
"the ""open zones"" are like sonic playgrounds, while the more ""traditional"" one-off stages in between are like tests of your skill and make you want to push it to the limit...

it's fun. the game is fun.

and the fact they have some ""development roadmap"" ahead to top off an already complete experience?

awesome. cheers to an amazing sonic game.",,
"30 hours to finish the game, and 4 of the 5 Islands are only at 50% so there's at least another 10 hours to 100% the game, which makes this game the longest Sonic game ever made, and man that time flew by. Never was there a moment when I was bored, or frustrated at the mechanics, not once did I cringe to bad writing or level design. I can easily say this is the best 3D Sonic game and the best Sonic game hands down.

The game consists of 4 HUGE island Biomes that represent ancient versions of familiar settings. In these massive open zones you defeat enemies, complete puzzles, and minigame challenges, so open up towers. In these towers are Cyberspace levels, short 3D and 2D sonic platforming levels, do well in these levels and you get keys. keys unlock towers to get choas emeralds, the more you do the more of the map is opened up, and new rails and boosters to get to new places open up.
Once all of the emerald have been collected you go super sonic and fight a massive titan IN EVERY ISLAND (So you get like 5 Super Sonic Fights), and it's incredible.

Speaking of incredible...That soundtrack! Every Cyberspace level has its own theme song, and every one is a drum and bass banger, the open zones have this lowfi melancholy mysterious music that really highlights the mystery around the story and just what happened to you and your friends. The voice acting is really well done, as is the overall writing, characters get some real development, and we even see a more humanized Eggman.

Visually I think the game is absolutely gorgeous! Some say it looks like asset flips...but they are stupid, and haven't seen actual asset flips. This game is gorgeous, the Open Zones pair well with the music to give you a truly mysterious vibe to everything. The day night cycle is neat, but not really useful other than the starlight jackpot thing that happens, but it sure is colorful. The Cyberspace levels (classic 2D and 3D linear sonic levels) looks great, most are based on 4 levels from Sonics past, Green Hill, Angel Island, The City, and Chemical plant. They are not the main focus in the game...they are simply a way to get more Vault Keys to unlock the emeralds, which can be done in a variety of ways.

Which leads me to fishing! BIG IS BACK BABY! Yup collect purple coins in the open zones and find the fishing tower, and instead of a cyber space level, it takes you to big, and he gives you a rod, and you fish, for more than fish. You get fish, tires, springs, maps, treasures...all of this gives you coin that you can give to big and lets you trade for any other item in the game other than the Emeralds. ANYTHING! Eggman voice notes, story items, rings, XP, and Skill Points.

Sonics combat is like bayonetta or devil may cry, but with that sonic flair, so homing attacks, spinning cyclones etc. Its REALLY fun, the combat is incredible, and you have a skill tree to level sonic up. You level sonic up by defeating enemies, finding kokos (they are kinda like little chao beings), and doing the world challenges, you can then trade those in to get new abilities, and raise your speed and ring count.

The game is a joy to play, and I never wanted to put it down. I nominated it as my game of the year.",,
"Edit: Finally, just go watch VideoGameDunkey's Video on this game. Thank you Dunkey for showing how ""Good"" this game really is.

I have to wonder if I'm witnessing Mass Stockholm Syndrome with the reaction to this Sonic Game. How badly has Sega hurt Sonic fans that THIS is considered a step in the right direction?!

I'm genuinely flabbergasted that people are as accepting of this and that the justifications I've heard that it's ""Good for a Sonic game"" is how people are swallowing this horse sized pill. Big Ooof.

I've only completed the first Island thus far but I have to say, everything about this feels wrong. I swear, there doesn't seem to be any actual DESIGN when it comes to the world building, the pop in for the floating rails and platforms that don't exist until you are already committed to the movement is a travesty. This game clearly did not start as a Sonic game during initial development and feels like it was pitched as something else and Sonic was bolted onto it. This is further evidenced by how the cyber zones seem to be using the old sonic control styles as if ripped from those respective games.

And the Story, oh man, the story is one hot piece of mess that gives nothing to you as the player for thus far the first 5 hours. (Not that I truly expect a good story from a Sonic Game besides, HEY LOOK, IT'S TAILS AND AMY, MEMBER THEM?!? WE GOT GREEN HILL ZONE!) The mini-games and little ""puzzles"", if you can call them that, are just cheap button prompt style mindmelters.

This is a hot mess and I plan on finishing it, if only to see if it ""gets better"". But I have to say I don't recommend this, if only to show a little dissension in this ""But it's a GOOD game"" mentality


Here's the update now that I'm on Island 3:

I get it, you get something that is way more passable then Forces and you wanna praise it and give it all your monies. That's your right. But lambasting about it being GOOD and letting all the things slide that make it NOT GOOD, is just laughable. How many times did you get forced to watch sonic get blue lightning before you wanted to rip your hair out? Or the cutting grass minigame to get a Chaos emerald to watch Sonic.....Dance? (The first time I saw this cutscene was enjoyable even if I hated the minigame, but then they kept using it, pretty much like all the reused cutscenes.) Seriously, I gotta be crazy if I'm the only one pointing out this ♥♥♥♥.

This game does so many different things instead of focusing on a more core gameplay that the bad outweighs the good at this point. Are you telling me that the boss fights are FUN? Did the J-Rockesque music drop and you just couldn't help but be hyped and miss that actual gameplay of the fights,ya know, that you just have to hold the two shoulder buttons and then press the Button prompts on the screen after you auto parried?

My gripe with the characters being used as plot devices wasn't clear before but atleast they aren't as grating as they have been in the past Sonic games. I still find their involvement simply a nostalgia nod to past sonic. (Hey! Dat's Sonic and Knuckles da game in that dialogue!)

Did you like going to Chemical Plant zone during the cyber space missions 6 separate times? All ripped from previous Sonic games? Did you like that the ""stats"" you were getting in one section of the game were literally removed for the other segments of the game?

There is NO cohesion to this game, just a lot of little ""gameplay"" things to tie into one big game.

Sonic Generations WAS a love letter to Sonic Fans....this is just them trying to be 5 other games at once, doing none of those games well enough to stand on it's own.",,

They fixed his arms. Now CWC will never play this one.,,
It's Sonic Adventure 3 without being Sonic Adventure 3. But I do hope for some sort of Chao Garden in the future. 10/10 either way.,,
very awesome and fun. best game since Shadow The Hedgehog 2005,,
"Hey, still beats FRONTIER airlines, am I right~

Better than Sonic Forces!",,
"It's the best Sonic has felt is years. You really ""feel"" like Sonic (ha). It's flawed and some parts feel like they were held together by sticks and glue (probably because only 60 people worked on the game and the budget wasn't as high as other games), but it's a really enjoyable game and could be the start of a new era of great Sonic games. I am really loving this game as a Sonic fan but I also hope the next entry blows this one out of the water. Give it a try for sure.",,
"In my personal opinion, Sonic Frontiers is one of the best Sonic games we have received in recent years. Modern Sonic has always felt like he was built for an Open World game, and Frontiers proves that point perfectly.

Sonic's controls feel incredibly responsive and fluent, easily giving past games like Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Adventure a run for their money. The animations for Sonic, taken from Sonic Forces with some minor improvements made, were one of the few things that I admired about the game when it first released in 2017, so to see them make a return for Frontiers was enjoyable and a good decision on behalf of Sega.

The only negative thing that I have to say about this game is how Sonic's speed during the Cyber Space levels will sometimes feel incredibly off, with it feeling slower than it has in any past Sonic game during certain levels, causing me to get myself killed at times.

Overall, Sonic Frontiers has a bright year ahead, with three updates planned to release throughout 2023 that will add a plethora of new features and gameplay mechanics, which will improve this already astounding game.

I give Sonic Frontiers a 10/10, and would most certainly recommend it to anyone who is thinking of buying it.",,
"this would be super fun for 30 dollars. requested refund after an hour, will pick this up again on sale once a decent amount of mods or updates release that make this not a terrible pc port. capped at 60fps with almost no graphical options at all? things just spawning in when they are 2 feet away from me when im on a 3080 and 5950x is insane, and the camera is almost unbearable, it just tears it away to focus on anything new in the world for 5 seconds lol",,
"I’m hanging on to the other side

I won’t give up ’til the end of me

Welcome to the mind of a different kind

Where we’ve been growing slowly

Think I’m on eleven, but I’m on a nine

Guess you don’t really know me

Running from the past is a losing game

It never brings you glory

Been down this road before

Already know this story

Face your fear

Face your fear

It’s time to face your fear

Cause when your time has come and gone

I’ll be the one to carry on

You can throw me to the wolves",,
"I'm officially addicted to frontiers, the combat is amazing and feels satisfying, the story is great, the soundtrack is a ABSOLUTE banger, The Titan Battles are fun as hell and never get boring or repetitive!

But i have some little issues about the game, some quests get a little repetitive, and sudden game choppiness/lag issues, and that's about it, for a longtime sonic fan, i HIGHLY recommend this game for every sonic fan out there!",,
"i lost my chaos emerald pls help






still gud game",,
"I started playing at 9 PM, when I looked at the clock again it was 3 AM, that's how good this game is.",,
"The fact that a game this terrible is sitting at overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam is insane. It is one of the worst games to ever come from the Sonic franchise, and that is saying a lot.

Sonic controls well (only in the open world, though), but there's nothing to make use of that control with. The world is big and empty, populated exclusively by a tiny handful of """"""puzzles"""""" copy-pasted to no end, and traversal just comes down to automated grinding across the millions of rails randomly floating everywhere. The cyberspace sections, the actual levels, are designed much better, but they come at the cost of Sonic no longer controlling well. It's baffling that in the empty, automated open world you have super tight controls, but once you enter the actual linear platforming levels suddenly your movement physics become so awful they make you never want to play these levels anymore.

The game also encourages or forces combat a lot, which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful. It's completely braindead and all of the different moves you unlock are almost functionally identical just with different visual flairs. There's no challenge to it either, as the only real defensive maneuver you ever need to do is parrying, which has no element of timing at all in this game as you can just hold the input for as long as you want. Just parry -> mash on repeat, sometimes mixing things up just to preserve your own sanity.

This game is terrible. This game does practically nothing right.",,
"I really had an expectation to at least go out of this game thinking it was a good turning point for sonic, the game peaks 3 hours in and does the exact same thing it did in those 3 hours in a worse way for the next 15.

Boost - Boost is still an over-centralizing mechanic and the game is worse for it as much as its been said. Boost attempts to fill in the gaps of bad level design by restoring your momentum constantly but not allowing you to really feel like youre a master of the momentum system in the game, because you dont need to be, to some people this isnt a big issue but a fast paced action platformer that barely rewards your momentum is awful game design, not because boost doesnt have any positives, but because the positives of boost can be obtained with better level design. Boost is a crutch the Sonic Team has leaned on for way too long and it is definitely the case here once again. Also, the springs not resetting your air boosts feels incredibly bad in some of the levels. So many of the bosses and mini bosses are designed so that you just hold boost at them for like 30 seconds - 3 minutes, no reward for good gameplay execution when the game expects you to already be going the maximum speed 24/7. This being said I don't even believe that boost is the worst part of this game, but a large contributing factor.

Open World - The open world felt hollow, the activities to do in the open world were easy and not very engaging at all, felt mostly like a time sink with no real depth to it. The game that comes to my mind the most in terms of such a throwaway open world design is Dragon Age: Inquisition, where so much of it is just meaningless gameplay fluff, but the awful part about this is that most of the game is this gameplay fluff, about 95% of it actually. The most unique thing Sonic: Frontiers open world did was add the Sonic The Hedgehog platforming to it, and its execution is neutered by boost and too heavily designed around it, also the inclusion of 2D sections is maddening because sometimes if you run into a boost mat(? dont remember what theyre called) or a spring it can force you into a 2d section where you are quite literally locked into it and forced to either complete this sequence (anywhere from 5 seconds to 1 minute) or break out of it by failing it to some capacity (going under a platform, missing a spring, etc). It is also worth saying that the 2D assets cannot be often targeted when in 3D as if they dont exist. Fishing with Big The Cat is a nice break but also feels like it is just sorta there to fill in the gaps for the flaws in the open world (good luck hitting 99 all stats just by being rewarded from the open world) that being said i did like the idea of it being an alternative to doing the open world content when i was getting tired of it.

Movement - I'd say the movement in this game feels okay at best and extremely awful in a lot of moments, some levels feel like they punish you randomly for not knowing whats going to happen off screen for doing the things the game has been teaching you to do the entire time, randomly punishing the habbits the game has taught you with some masochistic stage design. The best i got this game to feel was when i mastered spin dashing up a slope and getting Sonic to be in the trick state which is like the only way to keep momentum for a good while in the game. Lots of animation locking which feels like it removes a lot of fun execution that could be there. The second stage (1-2) taught me so much to get that S Rank just for the rest of the stages in the game to let me get S ranks with 10-45 seconds to spare on my first attempts. The tech that stage taught me mostly just helped me not get owned as much by the jank down the line and i was thankful for that (not a jank hater Sonic Adventure 2 is my favorite, mastering jank can be fun).

Story - Definitely cheeks and feels like an afterthought on how theyd work in the open world design into a story which is just, restoring all ur friends by doing all the tasks in the open world and gathering memory tokens. The little rock fellas are super cute though shouts out to them they kept me going. Voice acting and dialogue was pretty whatever as well.

Boss Fights - The first Super Sonic fight was a lot of fun to me and got me very hooked! I thought to myself ""if this is just the beginning im excited to see whats next"" unfortunately the fights following were just not that great, and because I decided i loooooove fishing with Big The Cat after the first area was cleared, I was one shotting most everything and while i could say that maybe you shouldn't level your power up so fast early, i feel like i would have preferred if the game stopped me cause... why wouldnt i see how far i can push the game early on for fun? Even though i was insanely overpowered early that didnt stop me from having to wait 1-3 minutes on very easy fights because they relied on making me hold boost for 3 minutes to be able to attack, some of them are okay and definitely cool to look at but didn't do anything for me gameplay wise.

Stages: - Stages in this game are mostly just references to old games with about 4 different themes, some of them were okay and kinda just let you get through them, some others really just arbitrarily punished habbits the game taught you for the sake of difficulty or whatever, in general there wasnt a single stage that felt like an ""iconic"" Sonic stage to me, very lazily put together and didnt reward you very much for any sort of mastery, didnt go back to any of them after getting the 4/4 completion. I hope we get more unique stages and new things instead of what feels like referencing old sonic material over and over and over. I could die happy never seeing the Green Hill Zone map theme again in my life.

Combat - Starts off sorta fun, very quickly you're given abilities that are priority use over everything else save for a few situations, its very obvious. This wouldn't be that big of a deal and you could still have some free form fun if almost every fight in the game and smaller enemies included were Mechanic > Vulnerability Phase, basically not doing the easy optimal cyclone dashes or whatever they're called just means that you may be fighting some mini bosses for 5-8 minutes instead of 1-3, which after you do it the first time you definitely will not want to take it slow. The Immune Mechanic > Vulnerability phase gets tiring really easily, the parrying mechanic requires nothing out of you and the reward is very good often, you don't even have to time the parry you just have to hold it until you get hit as you can sit in the parry state infinitely. All the fights in the game degrade in quality as the stats and broken cutscene moves become more relevant.

Closing Words - This game feels like it entirely just takes inspiration from other games better than it, and tries to execute what they have but fails in almost every single way. The positive response to this game has been very shocking to me but i was sold until after about the first 3-4 hours, after which the game took a massive dive in quality and its cracks started to show immediately and only get bigger and bigger. I was just passionate about a new Sonic game and getting to have it be the first game to break in my new PC! Hoping it would turn the series around for the better, and i think because of the reception of this game we are probably doomed to having generic open world sonic games for the next few years at least, i hope not.. but that will probably be the case. I was debating writing a review on this but I feel very strongly in the opposite direction of many people and want to make sure that maybe others who feel the way I do have a review to take a peak at that validates the idea that the love for this game may just be a giant psy-op. :3

Also sorry for the bad grammar but if you can digest this game you can digest this review x",,
I feel like I'm welcoming an old friend home. the crazy bastards actually did it. they made a good 3D sonic game,,
"At the time of writing I haven't gotten through half of what the game has offered, but I can safely place my bets in this being a genuinely well done game. Though, it's not without it's cons, the pros are outweighing them all in my book.

Pros-
Fluid Gameplay
Descriptive Tutorials
Loading screens are brush ups for abilities
Exploration is well rewarded
Game doesn't feel like it punishes mediocre play while still pushing for more

There may be a few things I'm overlooking, but without delving into the nuances I find that a good place to leave the pros,

For the cons however-
Single button press quicktime events
Occasionally overbearing hint popups
Sometimes it feels like you can go TOO fast
Medal hunting can get a little tedious
Camera locking can be a little weird, especially if it locks onto certain enemies

Overall, the good things the game brings to the table, visuals included, all manage to culminate together into a pretty nice package. It's a nice spin, a breath of fresh air. While a few people might nitpick I would highly recommend picking the game up if you've been on the fence from either trailers or minor gameplay reviews. The game isn't without it's 3D sonic jank, but it's few and far between. As of writing, I haven't encountered any major gameplay altering bugs or experienced anything particularly wacky that wasn't a result of either my own lack of skill or having gone TOO fast. The game gives obvious signs when it's time to put the pedal to the metal, but if you find yourself missing the occasional rail hop or falling into an abyss, it's likely due to your own pacing.

Overall 8/10. Good, fresh Sonic.

Post game finishing update-

Honestly, I think despite some of the inherent flaws the game still manages to shine bright. It remains fresh, the visuals are still really amazing when you stop to take in the view. Despite the magnetic gravity keeping you toned down it still manages to pull of it's goal really well.

Overall 9/10. Amazing experience I hope I get memory loss for so I can experience it again.",,
"I'm gonna preface this review with this: if you're a Sonic fan, this game is worth the asking price. Hell, you probably already got the game. For everyone else, I wouldn't say this game is worth the $60 asking price.

This game shows a lot of potential for the franchise. Visually, it's pretty good. The music is really good. The story returns to the Adventure style, which has been sorely missed. The open-zone formula is very entertaining to blast around on, zipping past a bunch of ruins. I did not expect the combat to work out as well, but it can be satisfying. And the game achieves an atmosphere at is nice to immerse yourself in. This game can be pretty fun and worth your time.

*However*, this game has critical flaws that holds me back from endorsing a $60 price tag. The open world may be fun to run around, but it's filled with lackluster puzzles and grind rails, which gets worse halfway through the game. Not only that, but jumping can be a crap shoot as it is very difficult to control. I can also count in the double digits the times I accidentally launched Sonic into the air because I boosted off of a pebble. While the combat may be fine, at best it's a mindless button masher. I'd also like to play a 3d sonic game, not be forced into multiple 2d sections placed throughout the island. Again, all these issues become worse halfway through the game.

As for the Sonic levels themselves, they all blur together. They're either ripped from other games or just bland. They can play pretty differently, meaning no consistent gameplay. Sonic will feel slow, unresponsive, and unwieldy in most of them. They're very much a mixed bag that you may or may not enjoy. personally, the ones I enjoyed the most were the ones I could beat in under a minute.

Lastly, the story is held back by how... off everything is. It's told through in-game cut-scenes, meaning the characters can't really emote much or even do much (which can lead to some pretty hilarious results).

All in all, there's enough in this game to recommend, just not enough to warrant $60. Maybe $40. Certainly wait for a sale.",,
"It's a fine Sonic game. 7/10

The addition of open world and collectibles is a fine idea, and very enjoyable, but the novelty wears off halfway through the game. When it works, it works, but you start to notice how jank some of the mechanics are and after a while, you just don't want to deal with it, but sometimes you're even trapped into doing it when you accidentally touch an object that send you into a 2D section (In a 3D open world) you have to struggle to find an exit out of. The physic of this game are also sometimes really good, and sometimes really bad (I'm looking at you walls and rails).

The combat is also a little jank, but once you get used to it, it's so satisfying melting enemies. But some of the enemies don't like when you do that, so they become an annoying hindrance to fight, rather than a challenge that's fun to do. The BOSSES though are a really fun sequence once you get it down, but it really just feels like a sequence rather than an actual fight. Epic nonetheless. Keep in mind I did play on normal, perhaps hard difficulty is just better since they did get an extra bit for the ending boss, which I feel sucks cause I feel like I missed out on something just for not playing a harder difficulty, which shouldn't exist for games.

The mini cyberspace levels are really good though, just a solid minute of peak SANIC

Fishing is fishing. A bit broken once you get enough purple coins, can just fish for a few minutes, and buy all the collectibles you need to finish the area.

The Cyloop is also peak spam. Thanks to it, you'll never have to go out of your way to collect rings, just spin around in a circle a bit. Down a few character tokens? Spin to win.

The minigames you run into are cute, but sometimes their purpose confuses me, as well as the balancing of difficulty.

The writing and story is alright. Some jokes were +2, some -2. I guess I was just oversold on this part cause I felt it wasn't really something to write home about. They were really building up to something but the ending fell pretty flat for me.

The music is amazing. Bangers all round. Even my cringe middle school self was giddy with the Sleeping with Sirens and Skrillex vibes with some of them. I am cringe, but I am free.

Best Sonic game we've had in a while, but not THE best Sonic game.",,
"This game is not worth the full price in the slightest. If you find it on sale, you may then read this review.

The game underdelivers at everything new it advertises, and has a few small annoying things inbetween. It's not a worthless experience though, especially if you like digging for the fun in 3D platformers. Let me elaborate.

Open Zones
The open zones were clearly not built with sonic's movement in mind but were instead polluted with mind numbing, automated set pieces, homing attack chains, and annoying activities undeserving of being regarded as “puzzles”. That’s not to say the open zones are devoid of any fun, though, as the game is weirdly true to the series’ roots in the way that once you have a good grasp on sonic’s—thoroughly customizable—physics you will find many creative ways in which to blast through these floating platforms and make the process of collecting items much more fun. That is if you can remember where those floating platforms are before they pop in a few meters ahead of you. This game has serious pop-in issues. This is not a polished experience whatsoever. I use the HedgeModManager to deal with a lot of gameplay and presentation issues. It's incredibly easy to install. Here’s a list of the mods and codes I use that change subtle things that go a long, long way to improve the game. Like seriously. Do yourself the favor of playing with these over vanilla.

Mods:
Tracker’s Physics
Island Tweaker
Reimagined Platforms

Codes
Disable Decelerate Collision
Reduced Homing Delay
Homing Attack Trick Animations
Disable Running Fall
Disable Jellyfish Camera Lock-On
Always Start with Max Rings for Bosses

The combat encounters are as flashy as they are mindless and repetitive. There is simply not a system here. You just play a selection of cutscenes that deal damage. It sucks. The bosses are cool and filled with spectacle and kickass music but they’re super(haha) shallow in gameplay and were clearly not meant to be replayed multiple times despite what the post-game content would have you believe.

One of the stronger parts of the game is, ironically, its traditional stages, most of which lazily steal level designs from previous games, but do offer a relatively new and engaging experience thanks to the difference in sonic's controls. With that said, these controls are weirdly limited in comparison to their open zone counterparts, especially in the 2D stages. This is an issue that was mostly addressed with an update that let players customize sonic’s jump deceleration along with a few other properties that affect both open zone and cyberspace gameplay (The Tracker's Tweaks mod pretty much fixes cyberspace gameplay in its entirety)

The free Final Horizon DLC shows that the team behind the game did pay attention to fan feedback, and delivered a set of cyberspace levels that show a significant improvement in level design, offering much more open, experimental and—most impressively—platforming focused stages that allow for broader creative movement. Just don’t use the spindash to fly over all of it.
Oh Also They Added Three Whole Ass Playable Characters For The Final Island They Are Fun I Guess.

I like the story on paper, and the ideas and setting it presents, but the dialogue is just not good. At least it’s trying something, unlike the past decade of games, but this is not how sonic stories should be written. Holy ♥♥♥♥ does it feel like a fanfic with the way these characters talk to each other. Ian Flynn needs to dial down on the “telling” of his stories and start focusing on the “showing”. This is infinitely more apparent now that he wrote for a game instead of a comic.





TLDR: The game is mostly mindless, janky and has severe presentation issues, but offers a fair amount of depth for those who want to make the best out of sonic’s movement. Don’t look at my playtime I just like messing with mods a lot. The game is roughly 20 hours long. I shouldn’t have said that. Goodbye.",,
"Game pretty good, 7/10.

Now if you want to the extra details and my opinions then you can keep reading.

Open Zone:
Running around the islands was enjoyable though I would say that there is far too much automation still with random boost panels and boost rings. They did do one good thing with boosters and that is that some rail boosters can go both ways depending on which way you approach them from, however, that is only relegated to the long stretches of rail meant for fast travel. Controls are pretty responsive and fun to use although there is little to no momentum sadly so the dropdash does feel a little stiff sometimes. The render distance for platforms and rails isn't very good but for me it was tolerable and (yes i know this is a very weak defence) you can get mods to fix this. Overall I think the open zone idea is a decent compromise for the massive difficulty of designing levels to allow sonic to feel fast without finishing the levels in 1 minute or less.

Cyberspace:
I can agree that cyberspace is pretty weak. There are definitely some fun levels, but in reality cyberspace kinda peaks at level 1-2. Sonic feels pretty stiff throughout most cyberspace levels, especially during the 2D sections. The challenges are also not really much of a, well challenge, other than getting an S rank in level 1-2. The level design here also isn't great sometimes, especially when they re-use level design from generations as the boost is no longer a weapon and can no longer kill enemies. Furthermore, the homing attack now has a lot of end lag, though I could still enjoy them. I have seen some comments that the loading screens into these is really long but personally I never thought the loading screens were too long. At least I can say that the music is pretty fun in the levels but that was never really a concern. Overall, I'd say just play Generations or Unleashed if you want this kind of gameplay.

Combat:
I actually really enjoyed it. It starts fairly slow but by the end I'd say that the moves flow really seamlessly into each other. The combat is flashy but not too thought provoking. But I don't think it needs to be much more. My biggest complaint is with the parry mechanic as I would prefer it to be based on timing rather than just holding the bumpers until something hits you but it's mostly fine. The guardians are pretty fun to fight mostly and the Titans are especially fun. Again they're nothing too difficult or thought provoking but they're extremely flashy and are definitely the highlights of the game.

Writing:
This is the best part of the game in my opinion. All of the characters are well done if you ask me. The interactions between the characters feel genuine and they all feel like themselves, at least in my opinion. I won't say much here to not give you any specific expectations and so that you can go in as blind as possible. All I will say is that there are lots of references to past games and events, likely because of a sudden much larger attempt at building an interconnected world and to avoid retconning things they decided to course correct too much by lots of references and name drops, but if you're like me you'll just let the monkey brain turn on and go ""tHe ThING, tHEy SaiD thE THinG"".

Voice cast:
First I should probably state that I played with the english voice cast and always do so for sonic games. I thought the voices were great. To me this is Roger's best performance for Sonic so far and I'd say the same about pretty much everyone. I'd even say Pollock outdid himself as Eggman as he actually shows more emotions rather than just brimming with ego all the time, but Pollock's performances have always been stellar. So yeah, the voices really did it for me.

Overall, the game is good in my opinion. And I feel like I should really stress that this is my opinion. Too many people online nowadays forget that it's ok to have different opinions. If you dislike this game, that's perfectly fine. I can honestly see why you would dislike it. Even I'd agree that this game doesn't reach the highs of Unleashed or the Adventure titles. I would also definitely agree that it's clear that the second half of the game had to be rushed. But in the end, after what we've gone through as a community for the past decade, I can accept this as the first steps of a return to the more cinematic and dramatic style of sonic from the late 90s and the 2000s. The game isn't overly buggy and I really enjoyed my time with it. And with how small the team was, and the constant nuisance that SEGA seems to be when it comes to how it handles its development teams, I'm just happy that the game is mostly good. Sonic means a lot to me, as he likely does to you too. And whilst I'm happy with this game right now, I do genuinely hope that the next game can actually improve more, be more ambitious with its story, do more with its gameplay, etc. But I also have to be careful as I think we can all agree that the last decade has scarred us beyond repair. In the end, I love Frontiers and I hope you can too. But if you don't, I can definitely see why.

Well, that's all. Take care, and have a nice day! :)",,
Locked out of the game I paid for for 24 hour (after playing for only 3) because of some DRM issue. What a terrible way to treat a paying customer.,,
Pretty good game. You get to go fast and fight giant robots. 8.5/10,,
Sonic,,
you can demoknight trimp in it,,
They finally did it,,
"Replayed the game after getting it on the autumn sale (i got it on switch at launch). I honestly like it even more than before. I played all the updates as they came out on switch, and now playing the game with the new qol changes and ofc the new story added as a whole, it made it so much better.

Edit: ofc the day i make this review they randomly drop a new update lmao",,
"Loved that this game was a departure from past games, the combat was pretty easy but i kinda expected it from a platformer, the animations were really well done though.
The music as usual was fantastic and i feel it hits harder if you hear them for the first time while playing, definitely advise you not listen to the vocal tracks before playing!",,
"My opinion of this game so far is a little hard to explain... but im gonna try.

Mario has Super Mario Odyssey
Link has Breath Of The Wild
Sonic now has Sonic Frontiers

All three of these games are good games, however Sonic is very different from the other two. Sonic is a fast character and you are basically meant to speed run levels. Because of this it can become a little complicated to actually make an open 3D world for him to explore.

Link has an endless amount of tools and weapons, and Mario gets different abilities in most of his games, but because Sonic is always about moving fast its necessary to make levels flat and very empty to actually allow for speed. Thats what this game is. A flat playground with some very basic puzzles and enemies to show off the ""new"" Sonic the Hedgehog.

I was hoping this game was going to click with me the way the Sonic Adventure series did, and from some promotional videos i thought it was going to. But it did not.

the Adventure series was goofy and it had its bugs. but it had heart, and it wasn't always a cakewalk to play. on top of that they were not afraid to change things up when they wanted to.

this just has none of those positives at all. At least i dont see it.

that doesn't make this a bad game, but its easy to see that Sonic's target audience is getting younger and younger with every game that comes out.

if you want something that actually has heart that will keep you interested, You may have to look somewhere else.

long story short... it might just be me, but the game just seems soulless. They upgraded the looks, and removed its soul.",,
"Is this the best 3D Sonic game of the last decade or so? Yes, absolutely.

Does that make this a good game, though?

Honestly, I don't even think the game is awful. Adequate is, I think, the best descriptor here. But at the price point they're selling this, ""adequate"" is just not good enough.

Frontiers is a 3D platformer that consists of a free-roam open world on the one hand, and separate levels on the other. The open world is everything it appears to be in the trailers. A jumbled mess of random assets for you to run, jump and grind through. While it makes for some interesting platform segments, it also makes sure that the world around you feels lifeless and flat. Remember Sonic in the 90s? The epitome of the 'tude era? Every single thing in those games just oozed personality and charm. None of that is here. Not in Sonic, not in the world he runs around in. Even the enemies are just boring grey robots. One of the first minibosses you fight is a tower with a spinning disc around it. You know what they named it? ""Tower"". That is the level of creativity they put into this.

The separate levels have a little bit more love put into them in terms of personality. Not a whole lot, mind you, but you can tell that these levels were the focus of the creative team behind this game. Which would be great if these levels lasted for more than literally one to two minutes each.

Graphics, controls, sound, they all follow the same theme: they work, it's there, it's . But there is no love put into any of it, bar maybe some of the music tracks.

And that's my main gripe with this game. This is a Sonic game, and I feel the overwhelming amount of positive reviews on this game are simply because it's a Sonic game that isn't . ""Adequate"" in a 3D Sonic game gets translated to ""Game of the Year"" status simply because the bar has been set so unbelievably low in the past. But take away the Sonic franchise from this game, and you're left with a subpar dime-a-dozen 3D platformer that would sell for 15 to 20 bucks max, rather than the staggering 60 bucks they're asking.",,
"One of the most aggravatingly boring and unrewarding games ever.

The game takes place on a bunch of islands that look like they were ripped right out of Unreal Engine 4 with props for Sonic to use just floating in the sky with no rhyme or reason. They don't feel like actual places Sonic goes to and interacts with naturally; they feel like playgrounds disguised as places designed for Sonic to run around in.

The gameplay loop revolves around talking to a character and finding tokens and then watching a cutscene of Sonic and one of his friends talking about whatever. They have this tendancy to reference older games for some odd reason, which feel like references so the player goes ""omg they referenced my favorite game!!!!""

music is pretty good though",,
"I can tell just from the fact that I couldn't put this down for 6hrs despite some visual and technical flaws like bad AA, camera stickiness, and awful pop-in that Sonic has found his stride once again. Nothing beats the fast paced platforming of a smooth, action-packed 3D Sonic game when done right. And I only just reached the 3rd (of 5) chapter.

Ever wondered what it would be like if the overworlds in games like Super Mario Bros were actually open worlds packed full of wacky stuff to do and fun platforming bits? This is it. SEGA has also managed to put enjoyable action combat in a Sonic game that feels appropriate. Quick, bombastic, stylish, simple. You still have some basic one-shotting with homing attack, but there's a lot of really smart boss and enemy design to enjoy that allows you to take advantage of new mechanics.

I will say, the visual design is nothing impressive when it comes to enemies and environments, but they functionally play very well. Individual stages, unfortunately, are largely recycled assets from Generations/Forces, but laid out intelligently with an actual challenge and incentive to complete it. There's some jank around the camera when navigating in and out of scripted platforming segments. But I can't help but overlook these flaws with how much fun I'm having.

Give this one a shot. It deserves it. Sonic Team's doing it right for a change, and there's a lot of potential in this formula going forward. If you're not a Sonic fan, you might want to wait for some patching, or for a sale, but if you're like me and grew up on the Adventure games, you'll enjoy it.",,
Finally a good sonic game after years,,
its better than forces,,
"I really wanted to like this game, but I just couldn't get invested no matter how hard I tried. There are countless things for you to do, but hardly any actual direction. The world is vast but weirdly empty. I had a hard time following the story, and the overall experience just felt like I was playing a big demo, rather than a AAA game. I definitely think that if this game had been delayed and worked on for a while longer, it would fix most of my issues with it. The music and the characterization is really good, but that pretty much comes with the territory of most Sonic games. At the end of the day, I wouldn't say this game is bad... it's just very mediocre.",,
"Worst final boss ever. Just turn the game off after the fight with Supreme.
Do you expect the finall boss to be the true test of your skills? To allow you to use all the abilities you opened in the skill tree? To be classic race against time in Super Sonic mode, while the rings burns with every second?

Forget it. Remember that annoying bullet hell minigame you had to complete twice to open certain areas? Light-dark projectiles? That one? That's the final boss. No, seriously. That's the mechanic of final boss. You shoot with dark and light bullets, just like before. It completely ruined everything great I've felt about the game. It's just heartbreaking.",,

"This game is a bit of an uncomfortable start to what could be an awesome formula idea and what could be an awesome experience. As it stands now, it's held back by way too much for me to personally consider it a good sonic game. It's a decent experience, and somewhat fun, much moreso probably if you're new to sonic, just... man the game NOT impressive. The vast majority of the open zone sequences either are just glorified roller-coasters or a 2 second platforming challenge, its fun that sonic finally has some space to really spread his legs, but beyond that everything else is just not that engaging. The cyber space levels are overwhelmingly awful, with the occasional, actually decently designed stage that is relatively fun to perfect. Story also is seemingly ambitious yet at the same time super on the nose and primitive in its writing? I'm not expecting peak dialogue from a sonic game but arcs characters go through are so cookie cutter I'm pretty sure I've seen deeper themes in the mainline mario games. Tails' arc is literally just ""I'm sad im so useless"" Sonic goes ""ur not useless silly!"" And then tails goes ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ YOU'RE RIGHT.""

idk, fun game, id wait for a deal, its not worth 60 dollars.",,
"It’s been a long time since I had anything good to say about a 3D Sonic game. Sonic Frontiers gets it right! The game world is a joy to explore. The physics don’t feel floaty anymore. The story is gradually revealed. The dialogue is good. The mystery of what this place is and what happened here is gripping, and it delivers by the end.

Though it is as if someone at Sega said “What if Breath of the Wild, but with Sonic,” the team pulled it off. I do wish the cyberspace levels had been original instead of calling back to zones from 2D games. I’m so tired of callbacks; please just move on.

Even so, the exploration more than makes up for it. There should have been more to find from exploring besides platforming challenges. To make up for that, minibosses roam the land, and you must fight them to progress, and each one is intimidating and requires the player to do something unique to defeat.

And then we have the big boss battles at the end of each island. They are intense. Epic. Sonic Team made Super Sonic feel incredible. Each island feels like a triumph to conquer, and the cutscenes do a good job advancing a moving story. (Only complaint is that if you turn subtitles off, you will miss translated dialogue in an extraterrestrial language, so be sure to turn them back on before the end of the third island.)

Sonic Frontiers does just about everything right, and I hope this is a sign of things to come. New directions for the series and the characters. I can’t say enough good about Frontiers. The team succeeded in making me look forward to coming home and playing a Sonic game, and I haven’t felt that since I was a kid.

[supplementary:

A 6-hour soundtrack that costs more than the game, and it’s gorgeous.

Combat is still basically one button with combos possible hitting one or two others. That’s kind of how Sonic has always worked. This could be the start of Sonic Team adding more variety. Thankfully, the enemies have combo-breaker moves, so you must be alert, and you must do something different to defeat each enemy type, so combat never feels routine or boring.

The open world format could have been used to discover more stories around the maps. Other NPCs to interact with. The “side-story” segments are merely more pieces of dialogue adding to the main story. They are good character interaction moments between the main cast, but so much more was possible.

The only reward for exploration is platforming challenges to collect items needed to advance the main story. Once the player knows the story, the player has little reason to replay the game. So while it’s an open-world format, I wouldn’t call it open world because other than discovering the main story, there is nothing else to see or do. This hurts the game’s replay value for me, even to get more achievements.

Still, what we have is well-done and a huge step up from previous games.

My main problem with the 3D Sonic games is that they fail (consistently, as if deliberately) to characterize their villains. Since Sonic Adventure 1, Eggman uncovers some ancient /thing/ and tries to use it for his own purpose, only for that thing to be an even bigger evil than Eggman ever was, but the games don’t give much of a reason for this thing to exist, or establish motivation for why this newly discovered/resurrected badguy is around doing bad things and Sonic must defeat it. (Sonic Adventure 2 and Sonic Heroes are exceptions.) Sonic Frontiers does characterize its villain, albeit on a surface level. It’s not a memorable motivation, but wow the gameplay makes up for it. The writing this go-round is a step up from previous Sonic games in that the reason for the villain is clear, the villain’s motivation is clear, the reason for Eggman’s tapping into “cyberspace” is also clear, and the purpose for the Guardians also becomes clear.

Sonic Team clearly went for broke on gameplay, but this time they did not leave the writing as an afterthought. Though all of it could have been stronger, what we have is hopefully a sign of the future of Sonic games.

Final Frontier DLC update:

Sonic Frontiers is about as perfect as it can be, but the Final Frontier DLC makes it weird. The DLC is just aggravating for the sake thereof. Maybe next time it will be better integrated into the story. You can skip the DLC and miss nothing, though it does make it easier to max out your stats and get the final achievements. The base game is nearly perfect. Stick to that.

"There sure is some jank and I hope the sequel has more sonic-esque environments. But the underlying game is still a great time and a fantastic baseline for the series going forward. If it means anything, this is the first game by Sonic Team to actually make me feel something since Generations. It's wild to say that the blue dude might actually be in good hands but I'm feeling pretty optimistic after this.

"holy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥.

an actual, good, 3D Sonic game since Generations. I'm stunned, but this game is really a lot i could hope for and more and i could not be happier about it.

BACK TO FIND THE LAST FEW CHAOS EMERALDS

11/20 edit: Finally beat the game, and hole lee shi its, this is a very good game marred by stupid bugs or design decisions. It could have been a 10/10 were it not for the technical issues. There's my TL;DR.

Personally, this is my favorite Sonic game since Mania, and favorite 3D one since Sonic Adventure. The gameplay, and the variety of such gameplay, is absolutely incredible. Sonic Team genuinely knocked this one out of the park. The story is very well done too...hell, had me tearing up a bit towards the end 🥹. Haven't felt a shiver down my spine from a Sonic game since Sonic Adventure or Sonic 3.

That being said...I think the incredibly ambitious nature of the game has lead to incredibly stupid and annoying bugs, or really stupid design decisions. Bugs are to be expected, but sometimes it's egregious enough to irritate me or make me put the game down for a little bit.

Some I encountered: times I'm platforming, and Sonic will just twitch off a platform? The draw distance is also absolutely *terrible*, and for a game like this really should be extended, dunno if this is a bug or design decision.

Dumb design decisions: The camera should be adjustable, personally I found it was too close to Sonic a lot of the time and wished I could back the camera by just a few feet. When running by in a certain level, Sonic's camera will automatically point and lock onto one particular enemy. You can't move the camera or look in any other direction until the enemy finishes its unloading animation. Incredibly annoying. This one is tricky but, getting caught in the 2.5D portions of the open world map, when you're trying to run across to a certain location, is also very annoying. Fishing is kind of broken too, you can just fish forever and then get enough Chaos Emerald tokens or whatever else you need to where you don't even need to play the Cyberspace levels.

I know that's a lot of complaints...however, god ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ damn this is a good game, just marred by stupid bugs and design decisions.

I look forward to the next one :)",,
"A brand new chapter for Sonic games. It has a lot of things to offer, combat, cyber space and as well as the open zone.

While there's a lot of polarizing thoughts about this game, you can't deny it's a huge major step up from the past titles, and I'm speaking as someone who likes Sonic Forces. This game brought Sonic to the right track.

On the other hand, there's some glaring issues like pop-ins? which can be a bit annoying but not game breaking, it's just feels weird to see things just appear out of sudden, unless it's my PC configuration not optimized.

Contrary to people's majority opinions, i tend to like speedrunning the Cyber Space stages more, and the Fishing minigame is also a great break time killer as well.

Also, fret not there will be new DLCs like the Monster Hunter collab. Heard Sonic's be cookin there!",,
"I haven't gotten through the entire game yet, but from what I've played so far it's definitely a step up from the past few Sonic games. I wouldn't say it's a perfect, or the best Sonic game by far, but it's a refreshing experience from the more recent 3D entries in the series. I find the gameplay to be somewhat confusing at times, but not to the point where I have to look up a guide. I like the open-zone style enough, although I think the seemingly randomly placed objects throughout them interrupt the flow of flying through them. The soundtrack is fine enough, it seems a bit bland for my tastes (I prefer Jun Senoue's type of sound), so I usually keep the jukebox playing when I can. Overall, Sonic Frontiers is a pretty good game, and a step in the right direction for once.

8/10",,
"Bear in mind that this is taken from me rambling on Discord so it may be a bit jumbled. This was my thoughts AFTER beating the main game;

Well, that was Sonic Frontiers. I thought it'd be another boring, buggy, pre-beta mess that insulted the player with asinine writing. And honestly, I'm so glad I was proven wrong by Sega and Sonic Team. Frontiers is just a wonderful breath of fresh air.

But it's clear Sonic Team's still teething on this new direction. The Cyber Stages are pretty weak, the padding is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ intense and VAGUE SPOILERS but the ending feels rushed. But we still got proper Open World gameplay, a really fluid combat system and the first three bosses were absolutely fantastic.

Writing is...eh, it's certainly BETTER but tbh that's not a major step up. There's still some glaring issues with pacing and really explaining stuff. You get spoonfed info on the last island and I STILL don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ was going on.

But the character interactions? [chefs kiss] Flawless. The main team finally feel like characters now. Even the voice work is leagues beyond what it used to be. And it took a while for Sage to grow on me, but grow on me she did. I really hope she sticks around, becomes the Bowser Jr of the franchise. She has so much potential as a character, someone for Eggman to bounce off of.

Overall, a very flawed whole, but to ignore the good parts and smarm that ""sanic can't have good stories he's a small cartoon animal"" like Dunkey and Yhatzee is being disingenuous at best and flat out ♥♥♥♥-ish at worst. People are always going to clown on Sonic for views but those two just genuinely hate him, I'm sure. Frontiers signals the end of the Meta Era for me. A lot of the restrictions of the past feel lifted. I can see clearly now the rain has gone...and it's beautiful.",,

"Be aware of all the positive feedback that people seem to be giving, I must be missing something because whilst I think the game is enjoyable, looks alright and has a 'collectathon' element which I like in games, with some incredible music, the game is let down by being far too easy.

I thought maybe it was just because it was the first island, but progressing further i've not felt any sort of difficulty increase despite playing on 'hard' the entire time. The combat seems far too easy and simplistic, and the timed challenges, aside from a single stage, are way too forgiving. I think that's fine overall if that were on both Easy and even Normal difficulties, but the idea of 'hard' should be to offer some sort of challenge, and it's kind of killing the excitement that the game is trying to offer. I can't tell whether there was an issue with the game difficulty levels being bugged, which I figure would've been found and fixed already, or if overall the game was just made substantially easier despite not needing it. Especially taking 'Parrying' into account, the puzzles seem to imply a timing requirement but you can simply hold the buttons the entire time and just... parry everything.

Overall, if you want a simple exploration and story experience, by all means go for it. But if you were looking for something with a bit of a challenge, i'd avoid altogether unless it's otherwise changed or fixed. (Despite saying this, i'm voting no to recommendations just so my review stands out a bit more in the 'overwhelming positivity'.",,

"SPOILER FREE REVIEW

When this game was announced at the Sonic Central presentation, I was very hyped for a new mainline sonic game, but also very sceptical because of how forces crushed my soul with pure deception. But with all the pre-release development we got, Sonic Frontiers is now available in all major platforms, and let me tell you people still questioning yourselves of you should give it a chance: ITS WORTH EVERY PENNY I SPENT.

Sonic Frontiers is, in my opinion, THE BEST Sonic game ever (yep I said it, even better than SA2). Now that I have your attention, lets talk about this piece of art, shall we ?

The gameplay is pure Sonic platforming and intense Hack n Slash action: Sonic feels so great to control in these wide open zones (HOLY GUACAMOLE THESE MAPS ARE HUGE) where he fits right in, its perfect. His movements are clean and very fluid, and the skill tree (which you can unlock fairly easily) is a fun and very welcomed novelty in the series. The moves you unlock opens you to a wide range of insane combos you can do, its just amazingly fun I cant get enough of it.

Second of all are the enemies: WHAT A BREATH OF FRESH AIR THESE ARE! Finally, challenging npcs that actually want to kill you, all they want is you to suffer and they deliver it (well not Dark Souls level of suffering but you get it lol). Theres the small fries that show up alone or in groups, they die in 1 hit usually, the average enemies, again, alone or in groups, but they require some quick combos to get rid of, and the minibosses, which are comparable to actual bosses in previous sonic games (theyre even better in most cases). And then theres the actual Bosses, this is a spoiler free review so all I can say is you better have a few extra pairs of underwear ready, especially for the DMC and Bayonetta fans out there (wink lmao). So yea, enemies, badass designs, hella fun, ggwp.

Third of all, the Music, I mean, do I really have to say it? Its Sonic Team Sound were talking about, NAME ONE SONIC GAME WITH NO BANGERS, EVEN FORCES HAD SLAPPING OSTS. Music enjoyers, your ears are in for the best treat.

And last but not least, the story. Again, this is a Spoiler free review so ill give you a glimpse of whats going on here. As from all we got from the pre-release trailer, we understand that the plot involves sonic and his friends looking for the chaos emeralds in the starfall Islands, and there is Sage, who is trying to stop sonic from messing around the place, but it goes even beyond this, like the tip of an iceberg vs the actual size of it. It really feel like it came from the prime sonic era, with adventure, heroes, etc. They gave us back this shonen type of story and it truly is what Sonic is: a shonen hero. Also one more thing, for everyone, especially the veteran sonic fans, you guys are in for one heck of a ride (TRYING TO HOLD MY HYPE)!!!


All in all, Sonic Frontiers is a SMASH HIT and Sonic Team should be really proud of what they just accomplished. Their hard work really paid off, and it shows how they have this special passion for the blue blur, even after some failed attempts over the past decade. I hope they keep working on this track, its a winning one. This game is literally the ""Super Mario Odyssey"" treatment given to Sonic: there are no low points here, its a new direction in the series full of easter eggs from all the series and Im glad that we live in a timeline where we can experience it.

10/10, CHEF KISS",,
"While it has the blueprints for something that could be great, it's an absolute mess. Perhaps not as bad as Sonic Forces, but still just not a very good game overall.

The ""open zones"" are relatively empty with very little to do besides platforming with relatively poor physics, forced 2D segments, and just questionable jank all around. Granted this is a game aimed more at a younger audience, the puzzles are relatively insulting with how easy they are. The upgrades for Ring Capacity and Speed are a pain to get since for some reason you can't have the NPC do upgrades in bulk, you have to do each individual upgrade one at a time. The gameplay becomes very dull and repetitive very quickly.

As you go through the story, there are some mini games that are required for progression. They are generally very unenjoyable.

The Cyber Space levels are where you really get to see how bad the physics are, especially in the 2D Cyber Space levels. These levels would be enjoyable if the physics were corrected. It's just baffling how they can mess this up again despite having made games like Unleashed and Generations in the past. Also, they're only based on four different locations: Green Hill Zone, Chemical Plant Zone, Sky Sanctuary Zone, and some city highway area. They could have done more with this.

The mini-bosses across the open-zones are frankly not great. Many felt outright tedious and janky, such as the Squid, while others were brain dead easy. There was no real in between.

The boss battles are... okay? Sometimes? QTEs are not fun though, I wish the developers would realize this. Spoilers for final boss:

Combat seems to have some depth to it at first, but then you realize that you can just do two different types of moves and still be rewarded with a ton of damage. Also, why can you hold the Parry command in the air and just freeze in the air? It's very awkward.

The OST is largely forgettable. Some may try to argue against this and only cite the vocal boss themes, the final boss theme, and maybe a single Cyber Space theme (usually 1-2). The problem is that those make up only a mere fraction of the OST. The overworld tracks are relatively okay, though really just background noise to forget when you go to the next island. All 30 of the Cyber Space levels have their own tracks and that's cool, except the majority of them are extremely generic and forgettable.

The one thing I will give credit for is the writing. It's surprisingly competent for a Sonic game and the added lore is relatively interesting. Though I will say that every time an event from a previous game was mentioned, it felt like it was done just for the sake of doing so. It got to the point where I was ready for it to do a Family Guy cutaway gag.

The most fun I had with this game was the fishing and that's not a good thing.

This is a 5/10, maybe a 6/10 at best. If you really need to play through this, wait for a sale.",,
they better keep this formula and keep the amount of over the top action and spectacle again i don't know what i'll do if i don't get the hit of very over the top sonic stuff again,,
"DLC 3 is either untested or purposefully a letter of hate to the fans.

I was very excited to get to play as Amy Rose, Tails, and Knuckles but the difficulty curve is all over the place as if no one tested the game at all. It's not even ""good"" difficulty as it mostly comes from cheep shots, very shoddily programmed puzzles, and constantly fighting against the controls and camera. Some puzzles are fine but then some are an absolute nightmare where you are fighting to get the game to control the way you want.

While I would suggest anyone play the base game, only a masochist should play the DLC. What a major loss for fans of the side characters who had been waiting for this for a long time only to get shafted because the difficulty is so high compared to the base game in random spikes that it makes you hate the game.

Actually really upset because I was looking forward to this for so long and they have failed the general player base. Things should have been tuned better and a harder difficulty mode should have been added for those who want that.

Total loss for Sonic Frontiers and after 4 hours of playing the DLC3 content, having put 44 hours into the original game, I can safely say DLC3 is terrible for how much hype it had over the past year. Very let down.",,
"My ♥♥♥♥ was hard the whole time
Best Sonic game ever",,
"Terrible game in more than just the technical aspects. Lazy, boring world where assets feels randomly placed. Was an overall tedious experience which is never good.",,
"I got this game slightly more than 60% off and im glad i did, this game is very mid at best, the title says ""Experience Sonic like never before!"" yet i feel like i already have experienced this before and as a 3d sonic game its nothing new, the movement is hardly what i would describe as fast given a vast open world sonic feels slower than ever with a boost button that you'll hit over and over again thinking is this is it? is this sonic's top speed?

The gameplay consists of run here make a circle around this thing hit the attack button to bounce off an enemy multiple times until its dead, collect some orb, some key, some ring yadayadayada unlock some gated level, try to beat the S ranking time on a level then go back and collect the random tokens and as much rings to count as a pass then go back out into the open and do a bunch of random run around side activities that don't bring much meaning to the experience.

The Story was such a yawnfest that i felt the need to skip what cutscenes i could then there's others that don't even let you skip, just looks like Sonic is trapped in a simulator and his friends are strewn about behind ai robots and generic code, Sonic's voice actor doesn't feel like traditional sonic to me i've played quite a few 3d sonic games prior to this one and this dude literally sounds bored.

I will finish this once and never touch it again, its average for a 3d sonic game, the graphics aren't that great and the pop in of the scenery despite running this on top tier 4090 rtx looks like xbox 360 garbage not to mention a capped framerate of 60fps, even the colors in Sonic Heroes had more liveliness to it than this game's constant switch between rainy England theme and casual monday sun.

This is definitely a 4.5/10 rating for sure, below average.",,
"My distracted internet addict brain enjoyed this more than BotW, don't @ me",,
where were you when Sonic was good again?,,
"I really wanted to like this game, and I went in with pretty high expectations due to how positive reviews were. Even if I didn't however, I still would have been let down and I genuinely do not understand the praise for this game. It does some things VERY right, and is a good sign for the franchise going forward, but it's still a buggy, unpolished, poorly thought out mess of a game.

To begin with, the combat and exploration do not flow well together at all and both on their own merits are poorly done.

Sonic controls fairly well, but the open zone areas are hurt by a lack of verticality and railroading. Many sections will see you being bounced around between springs and dash pads with minimal input required other than timing jumps, homing attacks and the odd boost. There are also sections where the camera becomes locked and you're forced to go through a section of obstacles in order to return it to normal, literally locking you into a small part of the map until you complete a small platforming challenge. The game also will simply not let you interact with some parts of the map until you meet a certain objective. The pop-in makes exploring frustrating as you can't tell where certain things are until you're close enough, and the rewards for going along with the exploration are also bad, with the vast majority of ""puzzles"" barely even counting as such and the game mainly just giving you stat boosts in return.

The cyberspace stages aren't much better, being a total mixed bag of level design. This is because the majority of them were ripped from previous games in the series, and between that and 3 of the 4 settings for cyberspace mostly just being re-used assets from previous games they are extremely recycled. Sonic controlling well makes the well designed stages fairly enjoyable, but overall they feel like padding.

As for the combat, it's not bad but is far from what it could be. The basic combo works well enough, but many of the combat systems are poorly done. All of Sonic's various attacks are just various animations that do slightly more or less damage than each other, aside from dodging a few attacks with the stomp there is basically no reason to use most of the skills as opposed to the one that has the highest DPS. The combat quickly devolves to mashing with no reward for experimenting or trying to be stylish. Parrying is not satisfying because it doesn't take effort and is more akin to blocking, limiting the designs of enemies and bosses, and quite a few mini-bosses are glorified mini-games.

The bosses also just feel unfinished, especially past the first one, with awkward transitions between cutscenes of counter-attacks and the normal gameplay, low attack variety and aspects of the bosses' designs going unused. Knight is the most egregious as the second phase is nothing but parrying the shield into it and then whaling on it despite the previous cutscene showing it firing laser barrages out of its shoulders. The final boss is also awful, being an incredibly lazy re-color of the first boss and having confusing barriers to beating it that require either looking it up or bashing your head against a brick wall until you figure it out. The true final boss on Hard mode of the main story is also one of the worst the series has ever had, being a reskin of a hacking mini-game and not using the game's main combat system at all.

The game looks decent enough on the ground but the actual environments lack the stylization present in games like Sonic Adventure 1 & 2 or Unleashed. Between that, the aforementioned pop-in and floating metal platforms lend to the game feeling very unfinished and like you're playing a test build. Very little of the game outside Cyberspace looks like it takes place in Sonic's setting. The game also still has the issue of Sega re-using very old models with minor tweaks for all the characters, which lack expressiveness and lead to awkward faces when the animators try to make them emote.

That isn't to say the game is all bad. For starters the animations and effects look pretty good, though I would argue Unleashed is still the better looking game which is sad since it's well over a decade old. The spectacle of the boss fights is one of the best parts of the game. The cutscenes are also generally well done, with a fair amount happening during the major story beats as opposed to some of the previous games like Forces where the vast majority is just characters standing around talking.

The music is also great, most notably the boss tracks with excellent vocals and strong melodies and instrumentation. They're some of the best music in the series. The rest of the music isn't quite as good, but there are still some good tracks for the mini-bosses. The overworld music is definitely the weakest, being pretty generic orchestral music. It isn't inherently bad, but it's another factor that makes it feel less like an open-ended Sonic game and more like Sonic getting dropped into an Unreal demo.

The story and voice acting are the last part of the game that deserve praise, even if they're far from perfect. For starters the characters are more in-character than they have been in a long time. Sonic shows clear care for others and has a proper range of emotion rather than being a cocky jokester all the time, Tails wants to prove himself, Knuckles is shown to be thoughtful and contemplative even if he's naive to the world outside Angel Island as opposed to a complete meathead and having a friendly rivalry with Sonic, and Amy is now more than just a Sonic fangirl being strong-willed and having goals besides just getting with Sonic. The voice actors also all did a great job, with Sonic and Eggman being the highlights giving the right tones to show their personality. Unfortunately they aren't always used the best as there are awkward moments in some cutscenes or parts where it seems like they should've been talking or grunting but didn't vocalize at all, but for the most part it's great. The story also takes a more serious tone and makes the whole series feel connected, giving more explanation on the origin of the emeralds and with characters referencing characters and events from previous games. It has issues, with the overall plot being quite generic and not a lot happening outside of Sonic finding his friends, interacting with Sage and fighting the titans, but it's probably the best story the series has had since Unleashed or even Sonic Adventure 2.

Where it fumbles is with Sage, with the emotional beats she's supposed to have not landing at all due to a lack of interaction with her and this being the first game she's in. One part plays sad music to a montage of her interacting with Eggman from earlier parts of the game, and it ends up laughable when it's meant to be sad. The ending of the game also drops the ball, with a complete lack of resolution between Sonic, Eggman and Sage and no sign of Sage feeling conflict with Eggman due to her coming to understand Sonic's perspective but still being totally loyal to Eggman in the end.

I wish this game was good, but I just can't say it is. It's the most burned I've felt from any game purchase since Paper Mario Sticker Star, which is saying a lot. I don't completely hate it because in some areas it's a big improvement and I'm excited to see where they'll take the games with a heavier focus on combat that's actually fun as opposed to Sonic Heroes' homing attack spam, but it has far too many issues. I realize this can largely be attributed to Sonic Team lacking staff and funding, but even then indie game developers are able to do more with less and the game was in development for 5 years, plus 1 more for all the updates. It feels like they got far too ambitious for their own good and ended up not being able to put enough time or thought into the game, with the end result being most of it is sub-par at best and unfixable in the end.

"We've been waiting a long, long time for there to be another good fully 3D Sonic game and Frontiers doesn't disappoint. This port is okayish. The game's locked at 30 or 60 fps. You can apparently use cheat engine to get it uncapped, which is pretty annoying. It doesn't apepar to have actual fullscreen, as borderless and fullscreen appear to be identical. The LODs also aren't what they should be. It's a pretty decent-looking game, but it's obvious that there wasn't any intention of allowing PC gamers to get the most out of its visuals.

As for the game itself, it's a lot of fun. Sonic and company are trapped on a series of islands. The islands themselves are several open maps where you have to explore to find collectibles that allow you to progress the story. You'll also need to find the Chaos Emeralds in each map in order to fight a giant boss. To get the Chaos Emeralds, you have to play some stages that are akin to Sonic Colors in order to get keys to unlock the emeralds. These levels are enjoyable, as are the open maps. They're densely packed with lots of things to find, including the main collectible, small Korok-like creatures that allow you to increase Sonic's speed or ring capacity, and blue and red collectibles that increase his defense and attack respectively.

The controls on gamepad are surprisingly good. Controlling Sonic in 3D has never felt better, as he's fast when boosting and easy to control when not. The camera does a good job of focusing on the action without feeling overly unwieldy. I don't know how, but Sonic Team actually pulled it off. The story isn't all that interesting so far, but it's not bad or overly cringey or anything. This is easily the best 3D Sonic game. I'm sure there are people that'll argue that the Adventure Trilogy are better, but the controls and camera here blow them out of the water by a fairly wide margin. I'm sure fans will make this port a more impressive prospect within the week.",,

i'm tired of being a sonic fan",,
"Only with the first island 100% completed i can already say they nailed it , sonic came back and came back stronger than ever! i'll edit my review once i complete the game but i doubt it gonna change any time soon!

"I love this game, and I've sunk enough time into it to come to the conclusion that this has been one of the most meaningful experiences with a game that I've ever had.
Much of this comes down to personal reasons, and that this game came out at the perfect time for me to find escape in a whole new journey.

This is... a tricky game to talk about. Yes, it's very flawed in aspects, and yes, it's certainly lacking in some of the more traditional aspects.
But good god, the time I've had playing this game has just been a blast.
The open zone I always find enjoyable to traverse and it's seriously an incredible feeling to mess with the game's mechanics and see how far you can push it.
Janky? Yeah, but in a way that leads to some really fun and fluid movement that you have such control and freedom over. And nonetheless - you can literally adjust the tightness and controls for Sonic yourself in the settings.

The combat is gonna be hit or miss for everyone, but I love it. One issue? Weaker enemies can be a bit repetitive to fight at times, and the skill tree is a little chaotic and automated at points.
The fights are also mostly quite easy, even on hard mode (which you should absolutely be playing on for this game, as it nabs you the best ending) .

Cyberspace is something I was very sceptical of, but upon playing them, I've come to adore their pace-breaking placement in the game, and controls and movement that you can really use to your advantage and blaze through the stages. I really like them, purely for a speedrunning perspective too.

This game also happens to have one of my favourite OSTs in anything of recent memory. God. It's incredible. I couldn't find a single bad track.
Go listen.

Story-wise... I really adore this game.
The immediate plot isn't hugely fascinating in the grand scheme of things, but holy god. What it lacks in that, it makes up for a hundredfold in it's character writing and dynamics.
It feels like it's been over a decade and a half since we've seen the cast this well realized in the games, and seeing them brought to life again just... means more to me than I can express, as someone who's adored this franchise their whole life.
It's essentially a big apology for a lot of the controversial writing choices in the games within the past over 10 years, and for that, I have so much respect and gratitude to this game.

One thing though. Am I glad that there is now more continuity and acknowledgement of past events in this series now? Yes.
But so many of these referenced feel very forced and hamfisted, like they're nudging and winking at you so we can pat them on the back and tell them we're proud.
Eh. Small blemish for me. Some may think differently.

And uh.
The bosses.
Wow. I avoided spoilers, and thank god I did. Totally worth every second.

I love this game despite it's many, many shortcomings. Adore it, even.
It won't be for everyone, and that's okay.

Sonic frontiers is by Far The most unique game From the series Widely due to the new open world synthetic Properties As well as The new Skill tree variances, action base combat system, & Collectibles As for the level themselves they're mostly the same with some additional Alternate paths to take and the controls are fairy responsive And smooth I strongly believe that sonic frontiers will be enjoyed by casual and sonic fans alike.

"After seeing awful looking footage of what is probably the jankiest looking open world game to come out in the last 5 years, I decided hey, why not, it's on sale, I'll give it a go!

Big mistake, it's sooooo ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dry. It's SOOOOOOO dry. Everything feels like a slog, all the fast feeling parts are automated spring hops, or rails that literally guide you into collectibles. Open world challenges are toddler level ""make a ring around this!"" or ""climb this tower that's filled with objects that play the game for you!"" or ""herd these ♥♥♥♥-rocks into a thing!"", just filled with bland open world objectives that repeat themselves within the first 30 minutes.

It's not even good for a Sonic game, Sonic Mania was good, why the ♥♥♥♥ are people praising this garbage?

Further proof that Sonic fans have no standards. I mean that with 100%. With 1000%.",,

Hear me out. IS This game perfect? No. Almost no game is.

IS IT CLOSE ENOUGH? YES. Here's why.

The pro's outweigh the cons any day. It's Fresh, It's new, it's WAY better than Generations, and that game's a DECADE Old (If memory serves) Better than TSR, SASRT, Forces, name a Sonic game, it beats it. The skills set is amazing, PERIOD. The story, REALLY good to me and I love how everyone's still a part of this game.

NOW the bads... sometimes the camera is a bit annoying and doesn't hit that exact place you want, and while rotating isn't bad at all, sometimes it can cost you. Also, no multiplayer that I've found, and it's a bit sad that Sonic is steering away from multiplayer unless it's a racing game. I for one, really miss mulitplayer, but it is what it is.

Still, it's a load of fun, HECK of amazing graphics, and though VERY Expensive, it's still worth it. Though... my advice, save your money until it hits a steam sale, trust me.",,
"These 2 updates have been nothing but a headache update 3 and this recent one. Crashes after crashes and finally after finally beating master koko trial and loading back into the open zone. The save icon is stuck on screen, I then open the menu and the text is gone. I try to save the game and I can't. I navigate to the return to title screen then my game just locks up it's stuck on a black screen. This game is garbage, it was enjoyable, but these crashes and lack of reliable auto saving just ruin this game.",,
"Sonic Frontiers let's us see Sega has learned from mistakes with past 3D Sonic games. It emphasizes Sonic's strengths, giving you a huge hub area as a playground, with tons of secrets to discover. Between these discoveries, you'll find thrones you need to activate to access more traditional Sonic levels. These levels are great so far, and they usually have a time to beat of around 1:30 minutes, which is very achievable and makes them a joy to retry to get better times. They have great music too! This game loop got me instantly hooked, and while I have only cleared the first island, I can say confidently that this is a right step forward for the franchise. It very obviously copied a lot of things from Breath of the Wild's world design, but I think Sonic fits perfectly, and being able to zoom across the map in seconds feels very rewarding.

The story tries to explore characters more in depth than other games in the past. It gives you several cut scenes of Sonic interacting with their friends and a lot of the story ones are animated really good, and are great for character development. I wouldn't call the story good, but it's serviceable.

Talking about bad points: The combat can feel very wonky, the dash can sometimes just send you flying off levels (as usual), and the camera can be sometimes atrocious. The pop in of objects in the map is insane, it can be very distracting at times. And while the voices are better than they were in the past, they can sometimes sound like a 4Kids 90's dub.

Having all these things considered, it's still a strong recommendation, and a great game so far. I can't wait to see how this new formula develops in the future.",,
"This is more of a thoughts dump coming from someone who grew up with older Sonic games (Shadow the Hedgehog and older)

Negatives:
- The overworld is extremely bland looking and especially ugly with the random floating rails and platforms. Also had lots of pop-in.
- The puzzles were all extremely easy and quick to do aside from the night only ones because you couldn't do anything but WAIT FOR NIGHT TIME to do them (no timeskip option).
- Was fun to run around but a huge annoyance was the fact the slightest bump in the terrain would just send you flying, which was especially annoying when fighting mini-bosses that need you to circle around them.
- The overworld has these sections where you get put in a 2D gameplay section until you get out of said section, and I would sometimes enter these on complete accident just to struggle to find a spot to exit that space. Which was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying when I'm just trying to get from point A to point B. This only happens rarely except on the 3rd island where it's a huge problem IMO
- The game constantly takes camera control away from you which is good in part when you're running really fast or moving in a certain way, but when you get somewhat close to an enemy or a mini-boss in the open world and the camera pans to them to show their nameplate, it's really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying lmao, at least they don't respawn quickly
- Menus are clunky AF. Like for example, when you pause, you have to click once to ""Select"" the Options menu so you can resume/restart/quit. Why? There's no other submenu, it's just Options, but you have to select it first to do anything. If you're restarting a cyberspace level, you have to press start, press A to select Option, then scroll down, and press A again to restart. Upgrading Strength and Defense are like ""just turn them in all at once"" but Speed and Ring Capacity are like. ""Hey what do you wanna upgrade? (Nothing/Speed/Rings) *long animation* Your speed has been upgraded. Anything else? *repeats*"". You do this for every single level and both go up to 99. Huge waste of time lmfao, glad there's already a mod making that slightly faster.

Positive:
- The new combat is fun and snappy, combos were cool, kinda wish the parry wasn't just a ""hold L+R until someone attacks you"" but it was still satisfying to pull off.
- Enemies and mini-bosses were varied and all had different ways of dealing with them. It's a huge upgrade from the usual ""use homing attack on them X times to kill"" that all the other sonic games boiled down to.
- Bosses were REALLY cool, all of them have you go Super Sonic, have banger songs and sick animations. They weren't necessarily hard but not completely braindead either.
- Even with all the negatives I said about the overworld, it was really fun to just run around, ride the rails, climb ♥♥♥♥, etc, when everything worked well.
- Cyberspace levels, which are just regular boost levels, were really fun, only some outliers were unfun (maybe 3-4 of them). I LOVED them loosely referencing past sonic levels, like Chemical Plant Zone from Sonic 2, and a handful of levels from Sonic Adventure 2. Like for example they had one based on Sky Rail from SA2, even though it was on the Green Hill tileset, it was instantly recognizeable. Think my only gripes are that they reused like 4 tilesets for all 28 of the levels, and that completing all missions on them were kinda easy (aside from 2-3 levels that gave me trouble).
- The OST is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing, the overworld/cutscene songs were eh, but the mini-boss, boss and cyberspace themes were 10/10. Legit would throw them all in my big Spotify playlist if they were on there (please SEGA)

Also for the story I'm split 50/50, it feels super simple like nothing much happened, but at the same time we got some lore on a certain character from Sonic Adventure which appeals to me directly. I do love how they reference the older games more too. Another neutral I would add is the fishing minigame, it was fun and inoffensive but made overworld ♥♥♥♥ kinda irrelevant in a way? Like if I was missing collectables to progress the story or upgrade my stats, I could just tap into the 999 fishing tokens I have and get more than I ever needed.

Overall, 7/10 game, had a lot of fun with it, excited to see what they'll do with this cause they have a solid gameplay base, just needs polish. I probably wouldn't buy this full price unless you're a big Sonic fan though, maybe wait for a sale and/or for DLC to come out.",,
"Salvo por la tercera isla y su maldito pinball que es una reverenda poronga, el juego está copado. Más allá de algún bug o problema técnico, o algunas secciones en 2D con los controles horribles, el juego ES DIVERTIDO y sumamente ADICTIVO. Vas a querer terminarlo al 100% agarrando todo y dejando el mapa limpito. En resumen, un juego con problemas pero que entretiene un montón. Eso sí, la historia es cualquier cosa (pero a nadie le importa).",,

"They finally made a good sonic game after the atrocity that Sonic Forces was. What I found very endearing about the game is how it protrays it characters like Tails, Amy and Knuckles. In past games, they mostly sticked to their tropes and never really expanded on them (e.g. Knuckles being the dumb one, Amy only being able to talk about Sonic e.t.c). Gameplay was an improvement as well and the story is pretty decent. Overall a fantastic sonic game. Definintely one of my favorites in the series. PS: THAT FINAL BOSS WAS ASS THO",,
"I haven't even gotten this for long and I've wanted to play it so bad, I finally get a copy and this, is the one game with DENUVO on it, causing performance issues for me!

You devs and your anti-piracy fears an shiz like that.

I can run all these damn games, I got but this one working right, I'd rather play Sonic 06 on a samsung galaxy! The Frame rate drops, nearby objects and foliage vanish, controls stagger, couldn't even perform a boss fight like a champ, absolutely stressful.

Denuvo, ya suck, and ya got blindfolds covering blindfolds preventing you from seeing that. No, don't ignore it, you actually straight up suck, and cannot optimize your garbage correctly for the consumers and fan-bases all over the world involving games you put a curse on, you just ASSUME it will work smoothly, like any money snatching company would do, without truly testing product on other types of machines that isn't only yours at base!

"Sonic The Last Frontier is the much anticipated sequel to hit racing game Sonic All Stars Racing Transformed which you may know as the philosophical game that asked you the internal questions of what Fast really is beating out such games as Last of Us for Game of the Year somehow five years in a row causing the developer to seethe so hard he decided to make a sequel hoping finally to take that golden prize but look out when he storms through because SEGA decided to one up DuckMan again.

Unlike its predecessor the cast of racers has been shrunk greatly, and fan favorite and top tier Destroyer of Race Tracks And Friends Metal Sonic is missing until the eventual You Hate Your Friends DLC. To compensate for this cast loss SEGA has decided to innovate the racing genre and pit Sonic on an isekai adventure to the land of single monster goo girls to find hearts that he can then give to little girls that live in his mind and can be anywhere anytime at once and that's a good thing. At some point Sonic goes fishing for sailors, I don't know why but it's symbolic for exiting the work force or something.

I have no idea what all of this has to do with racing, but I like it.

I give this game 5 My Youtuber Opinion Is Better Than Other Youtuber Opinions out of 4.5 A must buy for anyone who likes the Metal Sonic series or certain sassy lost characters. I look forward to the planned already announced sequel HYENAMAN and its Season Pass DLC SEGAHASBANKRUPTITSELFAGAIN and DREAMCASTTOOCANCELLED",,

"This isn't the best 3D platformer I've ever played, and doesn't even compare to a game like Mario Odyssey, but is a significant step up from the 3D sonic games of previous years. For the first time since Sonic 06, Sonic is truly taken off the rails and allowed to just run on his own terms - I just wish the open area itself was more engaging. All-in-all I had an enjoyable experience but I can't fault anyone who didn't.",,
"The best Sonic game in years, and a new personal favorite game. If you're interested at all, go for it. Sonic Frontiers is such a great time. May be a little janky when starting out, but once I adapted to it, it was a blast.",,
"This is a really interesting game to review. This is a bizarre way to phrase it, but my least favorite part of the game is the best part, and my favorite part is the worst part. Let me explain:

First off, the positives. The decision to bring Ian Flynn in on the writing was ABSOLUTELY the correct call. Lots of the dialogue and characterization is really great. Lots of the puzzles and challenges in the overworld are fun, and the overworld enemies GENERALLY make good use of the game's significantly expanded combat system. Once you understand the mechanics of how it works, it does have some general good ideas going on, even if they're a bit unrefined (I'll get in to this more later).

However, I find myself being frustrated and bored with the game more than I'm being entertained. While some of the platforming is fun, much of it is (and I know this accusation gets lobbed at every Sonic game, but I usually don't feel this issue) ""hold boost and forward and you'll get free stuff,"" as opposed to an actual platforming challenge. This ""some good, some bad"" issue extends to the enemies as well. While some of them can be eliminated very quickly if you know what you're doing, others (such as the Shark, which requires an enormous, boring QTE between each chance it gives you to deal damage) are incredibly boring and don't allow the (genuinely fun) combat system to shine. And then there's the ""cyberspace missions.""

So when I said earlier that my least favorite part of the game was the best and my favorite part was the worst, I meant the overworld vs the ""cyberspace missions,"" which are the more traditional sonic stages. Now, in my opinion, a good overworld would be a nice change of pace that you can run through and find goodies in for a few minutes between the actual stages in a game. Unfortunately, the overworld takes up the vast, VAST majority of playtime, and the actual stages are, in a word, awful. The stages (cyberspace missions) rarely last more than a minute to a minute and a half, and the stages that they have you running through are recycled from past sonic games, both in terms of visuals and layout. Perhaps most frustratingly, the physics in the cyberspace missions are MUCH worse than the overworld, and the difference is really jarring. Even the moment that I discovered a stage with a layout that was a replica of had the joy ruined by the fact that the physics made it a much less fun version of that stage to play than the original. And that remains true for most levels - any nostalgia factor is killed by the fact that the game plays worse than the title it's lifting from, and eventually you play a Green Hill or Chemical Plant themed level for the nth time and realize you're playing a game Frankensteined together from better games and the whole thing just falls apart.

My last gripe is the technical issues - While the game runs fine, there a ton of minor things that combine to just make a frustrating experience. Menus have elaborate animations that have to play out before you interact with them, which makes the upgrades you have to select one-at-a-time an insanely tedious process. The draw distance in the overworld is terrible and forces you to have to check your map for challenges instead of just looking around. Setting the game to fullscreen causes it to bump the resolution down by one item on the resolution options list, with the only workaround being to set your game to borderless windowed. Like I said, nothing game-breaking or truly awful, but enough small things to make for a tedious experience.

In a nutshell, there are some good ideas here. Some of the overworld platforming could be used to make a decent level, and the combat systems could absolutely be used to make things like boss fights more interesting. But as a whole it feels wildly unbalanced, and the most ""Sonic"" parts of the game are the worst simply due to a lack of development attention and creativity.",,

"Despite me being very sceptical when first announced and revealed, an extremely enjoyable fresh new take on the series. Much needed and honestly welcomed direction change after Sonic Forces basically looked at everything Sonic Generations did well, took it out back and murdered it

Nice blend of the linear style levels that you're long used to as well as the new open world free exploration format which oddly (and I never thought I'd say this), works pretty damn well and is a joy to navigate

Gameplay feels smooth and fluid, runs really well too (although a small gripe, I do wish you could uncap the FPS from 60)
Soundtrack is arguably one of the best in the entire series.

Only minor issue I've had is a couple of weird graphics problems mainly around rain looking like white dots when hitting Sonic, I imagine that'll be fixed soon enough though and it's nothing major in the grand scheme of things

If this is the direction we're going in for the future then honestly I'm all for it. Well done SEGA!",,
"Starting off, not very far into the game but I genuinely have enjoyed just testing out the new control systems. Now the movement takes some getting used to, but so far it is incredibly enjoyable. The atmosphere of the game, from the enemy designs to the lighting and sound design are truly superb. This is a more than solid experience, I'd say even fantastic, but not perfect (but nothing truly is perfect in the video game world, and that's alright to me).",,
"This game has so many strange design choices, but I could forgive all of that if the world design was more interesting and the gameplay loop didn't become tedious so quickly. I'll just throw down a pros/cons list:

Pros:
- The best 3D controls a Sonic game has ever had while in the open zone environments.
- Nice soundtrack
- The combat is...pretty good! Probably the most ""complete"" feeling piece of the game, although it is very simple.

Cons:
- Probably the worst 2D controls ever in a Sonic game, whenever the game decides to switch perspectives.
- Puzzles/Tasks scattered throughout the environment are low effort busywork. There is no cleverness to the design of these.
- The majority of the platforming is only a matter of hitting QTE prompts. Imagine if Mario Odyssey kept asking you to just tap ""X"" instead of properly spacing and controlling your jumps & abilities. It's shallow and unsatisfying.
- The environments really do look like stock Unreal Engine 4 landscapes with a bunch of metal rails tossed around. I expect Sonic games to have more unique and appealing aesthetics in world design.
- There are A LOT of cutscenes. It's the best character writing a Sonic game has ever had, for whatever that's worth, but it's not compelling enough to justify the frequency.
- The game is too long for how little variety it offers. It should take 6 hours max, but it feels padded out to be closer to 15 to 20 hours.

Given another year to bake, this could be a pretty cool, fresh game. The repetition wouldn't be such a problem if the design was stronger. As it is, I expect many enthusiastic players will become bored long before it ends.",,
Good clean fun. 110%,,
"Good game. Although it has some problems its a HUGE step up from previous games specially the meta era, and can be a great foundation for future games.",,
"Screw the haters, this game is SO MUCH FUN.

I mostly agree with the whole 7/10, but the reason I'm loving it is because

1) Incredibly fun to control
2) Having a blast going through the world & just f*ing around
3) Cyberstages are fun challenges (wish all of them were as hard as 1-2 though!)
4) Despite kinda being a 7/10, there are many moments of 10/10 brilliance. Haven't felt those exhilarating moments in Sonic games since... Adventure on the Dreamcast?

For the next game:

- Assign a bigger dev team to the game! Give 'em more budget & time! They're obviously skilled, but need more resources.
- More interesting cyberspaces would be neat. Level design was great, visuals... too familiar
- Make Every S-rank as difficult to get as 1-2. Maybe give the vault keys out at A so people can progress, but the challengers can have fun with it
- Fix the pop-ins...
- Reduce the cringe a little bit (one-two places in the story were painful.) Rest was really good though, looking forward to more from this new writing team for Sonic.

Love this new formula though, hope Sonic Team keeps it up and iterates on it.

100% recommended if the game looks fun to you. You'll be in for a great time.",,
"As a die hard Sonic fan this is one of the strongest games in the modern Sonic era! The speed, combat, bosses and music all come together to give you a high speed rush of super Sonic goodness that is hard to find these days. I can't gush all day about how hard the boss fights go with the OST but the Final Horizon update really was the cream on this perfect cake! It'll be a while before Sega really perfects modern Sonic but this game is a damn fine start to giving him and his friends their own stories and personalities besides follow behind Sonic. I also gotta scream about the HUGE amount of callbacks and even mentions of IDW characters! Tangle and Whisper are mentioned and gives me hope will see them someday!

(Only thing that really sucks is Silver and Shadow have been benched for too long at this point.)",,
"If you can finish this game and still be unmoved, your opinion doesn't matter.",,

"it's not perfect but it's great and it's best 3d sonic game i played it so far
really enjoyed it",,
"I mean, for 60 dollars... No.
For 30 dollars... Maybe.
Its an open world game, taken just about everything you'd expect from other open world games.. Ubisoft map reveal, ""Korok seed collection"" , enemies you can straight up ignore, combat feels really easy to cheese... The list goes on.

There is some monkey-level enjoyment in running around, collecting stuff, but that's about where the fun starts & stops.
The voice acting is awful, Sonic & Amy's voices do not feel like the characters I know at all.

5/10",,
"SONIC IS BACK!!!

Man, Frontiers was such an amazing experience. It was so fun to run around the island doing different challenges and playing the Cyberspace levels. The combat, although a bit shallow, was fun and it was always cool to see the different attacks Sonic can make. The character interactions and callbacks to other games really made me smile. And of course, the bosses where peak fiction. This is why videogames were invented

Does it has its problems? Yeah. Pop in can really be annoying sometimes and the final boss really didn't live up to the hype. The islands could have been a bit more charming and unique. Also, what was with that many 2D sections in the 3rd island?

Even after all those negatives, i still had a blast playing this game from start to finish. This is definitely the right direction to go on and i can't wait to see how they improved things next game",,
"This is the best 3D Sonic Game since Sonic Adventure 2.

Everything about this game is excellent; movement, combat, exploration, bossfights, sound design, stability, settings. Words can not express how glad I am there's finally a modern Sonic game I can recommend to people.

When I first saw the gameplay trailers I was worried about the objects popping in the distance, but when actually playing the game I was so distracted having FUN battling the enemies and traversing across the map that I never actually noticed it. The maps are full of much more content to see, NPCs to talk to, enemies to fight and things to do than it initally seems, it really does just feel like navigating a 2D Sonic game but in a 3D space.

I also really enjoyed all the references to Evangelion and aesthetic resemblance to Death Stranding, I want to see Sonic Team reference things they like more as it really did make the game feel much more personal... or should I say... ""soulful""...

Hopefully Sonic Team takes note of everything that went well with this game and they expand upon it with a sequel! I'd love to see a return to urban environments since I feel they really do go hand to hand with Sonic's gameplay and they're always an aesthetic delight whenever they show up.",,
"Game is good but it's not without its issues. This is a big step up from Forces but that's not really saying much. Open Area gameplay is fun and the game genuinely feels good to control. The game's biggest downfall is probably cyberspace, the movement from the open areas does not carry over to cyberspace levels and it can honestly feel really sluggish to go through. Visually this game is really nice to look at, however the pop-in can really break the immersion. It'd be nice if there were a setting to increase draw distance or something of the sort, but the graphics settings are very basic. There are no medium settings, it's only high or low. The game is also capped at 60 FPS which is a bit of a bummer since it would be nice to see a game like this run at higher refresh rates. I'd say waiting for a sale is probably the best choice. I'm sure modders can do a good job at tinkering with the game to better suit my liking.

Side Note: The OST ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ slaps. First boss of the game literally has final boss music.",,
this is a good game,,
"Best Sonic ever... period..

I just want a chao garden and other playable characters.

:)",,
"A swing and not a complete miss, Sonic Frontiers is a step above the previous 3D titles we've been getting since late 2013. The open-world formula of this game is an absolute step in the right direction and with enough refinement, could definitely serve as the key to how a Sonic game should play in this day and age. The game is at its best when you're traversing the open world and navigating through the numerous setups that they've placed around the hub and knocking into collectibles that you can use to amp Sonic up in different ways. The combat isn't anything you're going to gawk and be amazed at, but it functions well enough that it can be fun when you're pairing it with all the Cyloop interactions, and the boss battles are great.

Now, with all that being said, there are numerous issues that this game suffers.

There is a lot of awful jank. Sometimes you'll be doing a homing dash into something you thought you had targeted, and Sonic just blasts past it, or you'll try to do one of the combo moves and it just doesn't crank out. In the cyberspace worlds, the rules with boost dash changes and it can be incredibly frustrating when you take in the fact that hitting boost in the air doesn't come out, which makes it annoying. 2D Levels in these 3D games are just awful, and they should've been removed from these games for a long time, and hopefully they will be going forward, because they serve no purpose other than people nostalgia tripping.

The dialogue is cringe as all hell, and the story is /alright/. The game takes itself /way/ too seriously and makes normally colorful characters a bit disconnected from their inherent idea on where they fit in the cast. The graphics of this game aren't bad I'd say, and I don't exactly share the same sentiment of it being behind, but what I DO think the issue is the lack of art direction. There could be a lot more in every place that just makes the person think that they're playing a Sonic game, and I'm not talking about Green Hill Zone, and a newer and more up-to-date engine could've been explored during the making of this game.

All-in-all, the game is fun for what it is. I don't think it's worth the asking price currently, sixty bucks seems steep for a game a lot of people had a lot of issues with pre-release, but it was a pleasant surprise after almost half a decade of mostly garbage from Sonic Team. +1",,

better than every single sonic game within 10 years.
the fast combat and quick paced cyberspace levels are perfect for this character.
overall theres a little jank here and there but this is the greatest foundation for a sonic game the future could have going forward. i normally dont enjoy breath of the wild-esque open world games but the quickness and interactivity of this one, from the fast combat to all the collectables or the unique minigames are very enjoyable to me. it doesnt feel like too much of a slog either though i heard theres a bit of padding at the end which i dont look forward to. the game speed and progression is perfect for a sonic game for sure. it all does the character wonderful justice.
ian flynn writing is as good as it is in IDW comics (which are amazing)
the voice actors do great and the cutscenes are pleasantly nice.
graphics are either not good or beautiful with barely any inbetween. pop in is pretty bad too.
enemies are fun to fight and as you get stronger are more satisfying to fight as well in both time to beat and moves you have mastered.
the music is as top tier as any sonic game, which is to be expected. spent 35 minutes trying to get S rank timer on one level and did not get tired of the bop soundtrack the whole time.

i am not done with this game yet but i can confidently say it has been worth the time and as a sonic fan i am not disappointed.

shout out to my friend who knew i liked sonic and bought this for me and the other friend who bought me the metal sonic thmeed controller. you are loved.",,
"I love this game so much. I'd personally give it a 8.5/10. It's got a lot going for it, and it's very fun from start to finish. It's got loads of jank don't get me wrong, but this games highs outweigh any lows imo. Just take your time with the story, and explore to your hearts content. It's Sonic in an Open World. What more do I have to tell ya? I just hope Sega and Sonic Team see this, and roll further with it in the future. This game was definitely worth the wait <3",,
"The best 3D Sonic game to release since Generations. Ignore the reviews saying Sonic feels slow, he is very quick especially if you level up his speed stat to 99. Yeah the cyberspace levels are short and sweet, but they're not meant to be long 20 minute levels.
I think people forget how Sonic started out with levels that you ran through in under 2 minutes and just got too into the longer drawn out levels of games like Sonic Boom or Sonic Adventure 1. You have to think even in games like Sonic Generations, Sonic Colors, or even Sonic Unleashed most levels where you actually play as Sonic are finished in less than 2 minutes, the same applies here.
They're not any shorter or any longer that what we've had in the past, just the short and sweet Sonic levels as we've come to know and love them.
These cyberspace levels (or all the ones I've played so far) are designed off of the Sonic Generations maps, such as the Green Hill ones and the City Escape ones, but it's a nice throwback and it switches it up by separating the 3D and 2D segments from them.
The open world here consists of five medium size islands you can traverse. These are filled to the brim with puzzles, obstacles, and items to collect by utilizing various platforms, springs, and rails throughout. Despite being randomly floating in the air without any real explanation for them, it makes up for it by feeling very fun and natural to the play around with as Sonic.
The biggest issue I have with the game is the pop-in of these platforms and rails. They'll appear out of nowhere about 100 yards out for seemingly no reason even on max graphic settings. Though this really doesn't bother me much and won't hinder gameplay at all, I can see how it can be jarring for some. Hopefully modders can come in and force them to always stay rendered in.
As is expected with any Sonic games, even the bad ones (looking at you 06), the music is fantastic through and through. Especially the tracks for the main story boss fights.
Ultimately this is a surprisingly great Sonic experience, and the transition into a more open world that lets you choose what to do and when, ends up working incredibly well. It still feels like a Sonic game and you get that sense of speed and coolness as you dash around these intricately thought out maps with all the playground devices spread throughout.
If you're a Sonic fan, I highly recommend giving this game a shot.",,

As someone who has never been a fan of 3D Sonic games...this actually ended up being a really fun game overall!

Sure Sega threw everything at the wall to see what would stick which makes the game itself kinda a massive mess but overall it's the most fun I have had playing a 3D Sonic game.

(Full Review Later)",,
"This game is fun for the first hour or two. Getting to learn the ropes offers the satisfaction that decent 3D Sonic should. However, everything past that is as empty as it comes. Expect to be doing the same one of three objectives over and over again throughout the whole game:
1.) Get keys from levels.
2.) Collect tokens from around the map to unlock the next cutscene.
3.) Collect a chaos emerald.
I'm not kidding you when I say that the game essentially ends in the first four/five hours, but is then soft restarted, and it proceeds to do this same thing with the same loop for the same amount of time five times.
The levels you play to obtain keys are often fantastic. The sad part is that they don't represent the whole game.
Empty open-world, shallow gameplay loop, nonsensical story, and jank as hell open-world/boss gameplay weigh this game down way too much for me to recommend it.",,

"I've 100% the game in ~25 hours and as a fan of Sonic games I enjoyed it a lot. It's not perfect, pop-in is mildly annoying, some physics could have been better (there's no reason for the drop dash and regular jump to kill all your m******m), and it's especially lacking in aesthetic variety (cyberspace and the last two open zones). Overall though, it's a big step in the right direction for the series. The story and character writing was a highlight, I got used to Roger's toned down Sonic voice faster than I thought I would.",,
"If you want my quick overall thoughts, skip to the last paragraph.

Growing up, Sonic was right up there with Pokémon as one of my favorite game series. The Genesis games, Adventure and Adventure 2, Heroes, Shadow, '06– you name it, I played it. As time went on, the series' quality wavered, and many people wondered if Sonic Team had it in them to deliver a great 3D Sonic game again, especially after Forces. Sonic Frontiers is proof that they absolutely do.

The open world gameplay takes an approach that reminds me of Mirror Edge: Catalyst, in that it's one big platforming playground. Exploring the world is fun, because the simple act of playing the game - jumping from platform to platform, rail to rail, shooting high in the air from springs, boosting, etc. - is fun, and each of the environments have these Sonic-y segments sprinkled all over them, making them engaging to zip through. You're incentivized with items that grant stat upgrades (speed, attack, etc.), while you will also need to collect certain items to unlock new conversations with characters (which you will want to do— more on that in a bit), and I feel that between the two, you're given plenty of reason to explore— but again, it really helps that the gameplay is just so darn fun.

If you want a more traditional Sonic experience though, you'll get that here too. The game has thirty different ""cyberspace"" stages that you unlock over the course of the game, and each one plays like a traditional 3D Sonic level. In fact, most (if not all) of them are taken from other Sonic games, albeit with different visuals. You've got the usual suspects - Green Hill, Chemical Plant, Sky Sanctuary, and so on - but there are also some fairly deep cuts here that, once I realized what level I was playing, made me smile like an idiot. My only major complaint with them is that despite each level coming from a different past stage, most of them are themed after the three zones I just mentioned, so you won't see much variety from a visual standpoint. That said, the most important thing is that these are fun to play, which they are: each stage lasts around 2-3 minutes on average, never outstaying its welcome, and going back to replay them and complete missions or just whittle your time down is a lot of fun. And just like the open zone, you're incentivized to perfect these stages— completing missions nets you extra keys to unlock Chaos Emeralds for the story.

The soundtrack, as expected, is fantastic. Tomoya Ohtani's team have delivered another great soundtrack with a decent but of variety in it— while many of the open zone themes are subdued and reminiscent of games like Breath of the Wild with how piano-driven they are, the cyberspace stages are often full-on techno and trance, while the game's boss battles consist of the sort of vocal-led rock themes that feel straight out of Sonic Adventure 2 or Sonic '06. All throughout, the music stays catchy and enjoyable to listen to, and the rock tracks in particular really help elevate the boss encounters and get you pumped.

Narratively, this is Sonic at its best since the Dreamcast days. While the overarching story may not be anything unique, there are some very big lore revelations here that longtime fans will appreciate, as well as a lot of calbacks to previous games (even somewhat obscure ones) that feel meaningful rather than simply being nostalgia bait. But the thing that truly makes the story great, for me, is the characterization.

In most modern Sonic games, Sonic and friends have largely been written as if they were Saturday morning cartoon characters: all jokes, little depth, etc., but Frontiers changes that and reminds me of how they used to be written before Colors and Generations. Characters still made jokes and quips - it wouldn't be a Sonic game without them - but they also show moments of doubt, playful teasing with one another and getting under each other's skin, regret over things they did in previous stories, and genuine character development. And in all of this, each character still feels like themselves— Sonic is still your arrogant-with-a-heart-of-gold protagonist, Tails is the younger brother trying to find his own way out of Sonic's shadow, Knuckles is still the hot-headed rival, and so on. This game has Sonic's crew written the best they have been in a very long time, largely thanks to Sonic comic writer Ian Flynn's involvement, and it's a large part of why I enjoyed this game so much.

Overall, this is hands-down my favorite Sonic game since the Dreamcast era, and more than that, I think it may end up being my favorite one *period* after I think on it some more— maybe it won't be, but the fact that I'm even considering it should tell you how much I loved this game. As a longtime Sonic fan, this game is almost exactly what I've wanted from the series for a long time, and it feels like a true return to form for a gaming icon that has often fallen by the wayside. If you like (or liked) Sonic and are debating getting this game… Just do it. I have a feeling you won't be disappointed.",,

"Game is very fun the movement in this game for sonic is very fluent and it makes you want to run everywhere. The combat is good but could be worked on better. And the physics sometimes just want to send you to space.

Now for the reason im writing this review. The levels!!!
The levels you do in cyberspace tend to have a skin over them but are just older sonic levels reskinned. I am not gonna complain as the levels are still fantastic and are so enjoyable. BUT other than that they are so fun to revisit and play again after a more modern update to them.

The soundtrack is on a whole nother level it hits hard especially the boss themes. I say keep yourself spoiler free from the bosses and just enjoy it when you get to that point.

The only bad thing i can really say about this game and it hurts me to say this. The pop in for objects loading in is awful. You can see them pop into existence. But thats the only real thing i think i can complain about.

From what i have played so far (at time of writing im on island 3) This is one of the most fun sonic games i have played in awhile and it makes me so happy to say this <3 I highly recommend this game.",,

I think it won't be for everyone, but that's ok, I'm having a blast and think it's worth a shot, especially on sale.",,
"I really want to enjoy this game, but I just can't. This game has promise, but it has promise as a work in progress as opposed to a $80 CAD + tax finished, one year old game.

The controls themselves aren't BAD, I quite enjoyed running around the overworld, but the levels themselves were absolutely NOT made with the controls in mind. You are told you can run up walls, but then there is never any indicator for which walls, and majority of the walls and cliffs you would expect to be able to run up simply do not allow that.

The audio and animations do not sync up, whenever Sonic speaks to the Elder and Hermit Kocos in the overworld, it's only subtitles, no actual dialogue. It feels unfinished.

Many paths and solutions are unclear, and even once you do figure it out, more often than not the actual means to do so are broken. The bounce pads, for example, the chains of bounces in the air, I cannot tell you how many times I soared over the second bounce pad, only to throw myself at it again and again to try and force it to work, finally manage to homing attack the second one, only to soar over the third one. The amount of times I have been sent flying off the edge with no way to save myself, only to end up back BEFORE square one. It's a constant loop of throwing yourself at it again and again and again until you can force it into working, only to have next to no idea what to do next in order to, quite literally, progress the story.

There is little room for creative solutions. I have found that many of the minigames in the over world are difficult to follow with the instruction given, or lack of, and some you either are far too slow to properly complete, or are lacking the mobility and control to complete if you decide to boost through it.

I had fun doing very few things in this game. One of those, ironically, was fishing. I enjoyed that. Another was just running around at top speed in the overworld, not doing any minigames, not trying to get collectables, just running. The final thing was a single level. The only level I had fun playing was 1-7. To me, that level didn't feel bad for the most part, and it was the only level I was able to get a good time in (1:02.69 when the S rank time was 1:25. That felt GOOD.) 1-7 was the only level I felt wasn't distressing or frustrating to play.

All in all, I would not recommend buying this game. MAYBE if it was more like $15-20 CAD? Truthfully, I would love to see this game do well. But it simply isn't FINISHED. It needs a lot of work to be done before it's an enjoyable experience. I do hope they can nail this open world gameplay, it would be so much fun to run around an open world as Sonic with polished controls and levels actually designed around the controls.

Edit: Unfortunately, I've played the game for too long to receive a refund, so this was quite the expensive blunder. This being said, I might as well get my money's worth out of this game and keep playing it. I hope I will grow to enjoy this game, but it doesn't change the difficulties and frustrations I have experienced. I'll edit my review again if my view on it changes, though I cannot recommend this game at its current price and state, and I don't believe that will be changing.",,
"I have often contemplated how to put what I'm about to say into words. I have thought a long time about this game, and my feelings on it. It has been over a year, at the time of writing, since the game initially released. And my opinion towards it has shifted over time.

""It's not a great game but it has some brights spots and I hope for improvement.""

This is arguably the most popular cope of the average Sonic fan. And I initially possessed it myself when looking at Frontiers. However, as time went on, both the good and bad parts started to look worse.

How much I actually get across, depends on Steam's character limits.
---
Let's begin with the writing, centered around one individual by the name of Ian Flynn.

One thing I can say with confidence, is that he is absolutely the wrong writer for this series. And that I am absolutely amazed that he has been hyped up to hell and back by the fanbase that claims to want improvements in that regard.

There is some good to discuss:

Tails' writing flaws from prior games are addressed. The insecure fox who would develop strengths during older games, just to revert during modern ones is now recontextualized into him being a young boy who's growing up and making mistakes in the process. Knuckles' friendly rivalry with Sonic returns, and laments that his life has never fully been his own. Something that his experiences with Sonic have helped him to realize.

However, Amy's interactions range from being nothing to absolutely butchered. Her charm from prior games was that she was simply a normal girl; one who looked up to Sonic as a love interest and inspired her to makes strides in her own life for his sake. She had no powers, no magical abilities. Just a heart that was as big as her hammer. This game, however, does it's best to change that: Suddenly, she is now a psychic that draws Tarot Cards to hover in midair and predict the future. Her iconic hammer barely makes an appearance. When met with a response from Sonic that she doesn't like, she antagonizes him. In the update DLC, she even has the ""strong independent woman"" speech, insisting that she does what she does out of competition towards him rather than admiration and love for him. The cute innocent girl with a heart of gold is replaced with someone arrogant and self-serving, and it's extremely off-putting. Do not let a westerner write your female character, folks.

Sonic's attitude from the 90's and early 2000's has been lacking for quite some time now in the series, and I'm sad to say that this game is no different despite the change in writer. Ian Flynn has his writing roots in the comic industry, and it shows. Sonic's personality was largely apathetic with sass. He was no superhero who did what he did out of some sense of heroic righteousness; merely a fun loving hothead who would often clash with Eggman because he genuinely enjoyed it and found it fun. Between these moments he would eat chili-dogs, and lazily take naps because he was bored without an adventure to set out on. In stark contrast, Ian Flynn's depiction IS that of a contemporary superhero. He's an everyman with little in the way of spice to his dialogue. He exists as the sterotypical golden boy who is there for everyone but himself. Even when interacting with others, he's there as the fold to give everyone else his wisdom and help them on the path that Ian Flynn wanted them to go down. This can work for many characters in media, like Superman. But it is not Sonic, and it does not feel like I'm listening to Sonic. I want his snarky and laid-back personality to return. And Frontiers does not give me that.

There are so many forced references to prior games when they don't make any sense. It's not occasional. It's frequent. To the point that it basically plagues every other cutscene. There was one point where the game delivers a half-baked acknowledgement of Tangle, a character from the comic books written by Flynn. Because the man just can't resist tossing in his OC that nobody cares about, and making them canon to the mainline entries in at least the vaguest way possible.

I'm not a fan of the plot. I will spoil nothing here, but I will say this: It explores the origins of the Chaos Emeralds. There are two problems with this. One, it ruins the mystery of the Emeralds and makes them significantly less interesting as a result. Two, it does it with the biggest wet fart possible. You will gather a vague idea of what the story is going for very early on, and yes: It's exactly what you'll think it is. The ""lore"" of the Sonic universe is prioritized here, to the game's detriment.

Overall, is it an improvement compared to the slop from prior entries, Generations and onward? I would argue it's not. Almost any change here is garbage: They merely substituted the self-aware diaper humor with something bland and uninspired. The minor justice they do with Tails, Knuckles are compensated for by the lack of attention towards Sonic and the butchering of Amy. The highlight of the writing involves Eggman and Sage, but I would easily sacrifice those moments to get rid of the others that the game introduces. Any advantages are eclipsed by it's downsides.

Next up is the actual gameplay.

The open world isn't great. Basically, there are five islands, and every one of these islands except one serves as a marathon where you do tedious platforming challenges and collect items for completing them. It's mostly boring, but Sonic is at his fastest here so it's sufferable.

The cyberspace levels are horrible. They are absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and anyone should feel ashamed for saying otherwise. I am amazed that the devs looked at them and thought to themselves that this was enjoyable enough to leave in the full release. Many of the stages are themed after one of three environments: Green Hill, Chemical Plant, and (for some reason) generic unspecified city locale. In terms of actual stage design, many are just worse versions of stages from previous games. For example, imagine SA2's White Jungle, but worse and with a Green Hill coat of paint. To add insult to injury, Sonic feels slow as molasses and didn't have any momentum until an update added it in retroactively. Running forward or to the side makes Sonic run at the pace of a light jog, and boosting barely even speeds you up.

The game's ""combat"" plays-at it's best-like a geriatric Devil May Cry, with none of the complexity or depth. You have an RPG-like leveling system where you gain more moves as you play, but most of them couldn't matter less. Just unlock the quick cyloop, and the game practically plays itself. If that's not braindead enough, just hold L+R. You'll get a free parry that can be held for an infinite time until an enemy tries to hit you and gets punished for it. I'm not joking; they took a mechanic famous in other games for rewarding precise inputs, and turned it into an instant win button. Incredibly comedic in it's potential for abuse.

The bosses that you hear and see everyone cooming over online are entirely carried by their soundtracks. They just play basically the same way every other fight in the game pans out: You spam the most powerful attack you have, with the occasional flashy QTE between those moments. Then the boss has a cutscene at the middle of the fight, after which you pretend that there's something interesting going on for about 2 more minutes before the boss dies. The best boss fight is Knight, hands down. Because the fight makes you think about how you approach him for at least five seconds.

To be honest, I think this is my last Sonic game. Mania was a drop in the bucket. Frontiers is horrible. Superstars recently came out, and it's the worst 2D game in the series. The last fun 3D Sonic game was Generations back in 2011. Sega/Sonic Team clearly do not know what they're doing. As a long-time Sonic fan, I feel like I've been chasing a ghost for over a decade, and I'm tired. I'm not waiting another 12 years for something enjoyable.",,

"Ive beaten the first of three islands
I feel like the price point of 100 AUD is a bit high
but its good to see Sonic team finally doing some good work",,
The best sonic game in a very long time. Not without it's wrinkles but for a life long fan I couldn't have asked for more. Game plays good. Tons of stuff to do. Good music. There first mainline sonic title with a real plot in a literal decade. Ian flin as always does a great job writing sonic and the cast. The stuff with the Chocos even got me a little Misty eyed. Absolutely give it a play. Also Amy's new VA rocks! She really sells what could have been really cheesy scenes with someone less talented.,,
"This was fun! I beat the main story without much issue and it was a great time!

Going into the DLC was rather jarring at first, but once I got a grasp on the more advanced gameplay I've been getting through everything pretty quickly. I did finally turn the difficulty down to Easy for the fourth tower because rail grinding is something I dislike in any game (though I made it about halfway before finally giving up on Normal).
Currently, I am LOVING playing as Amy, Knuckles, and Tails with their abilities unlocked! Amy's upgrades let her just launch herself sky-high and hover over obstacles and reach places meant for the other characters with ease! Knuckles' infinite glide upgrade means you just return to the tall climing-tower section near the pyramid and you can easily get to anything without issue. Tails' jet... literally lets you fly with almost no limit! And when you get back to Sonic it's that wonderful feeling of just running along the ground! I look forward to finishing the DLC as well, but I'm quite enjoying the ride to get there. I've unlocked most of the map and fully unlocked everyone's skills (or very nearly; I have the ones that matter to me).

Update: Finished the DLC then played through to watch the Hard endings. It was fun, and I did enjoy it! Whoo!",,
"DLC 3 is just... dumb... You grinded all your stats to level 99? Cool good for you, but what if you couldnt use any of them for no reason? Is this for balancing reasons? Nope, the devs just wanted to make sure that everyone suffers playing the DLC. Want to beat the DLC? you'd better have mastered every mechanic in the entire game and remember old mechanics you havent been able to use since the very start of the game. Hey that boss rush gamemode was pretty cool, but what if you had fixed stats and had 400 seconds to fight all the main titans in succession without any way to refill your rings but also your parry is now 80x shorter bc we said so. Oh yeah this is mandatory so good luck lol. Why is it like this??? It goes from the most frustrating tower climb session in existence to ""haha funny tails robot flies over everything"". It cant even be consistently hard, its just random difficulty spikes for no reason. Let your game be fun man, I dont want to literally play perfectly to just progress the dlc story. Lock some cool cosmetic bonus behind perfection or something, no one should be forced to play like that. Not to mention this game is still a buggy mess and physics dont work correctly still. Cmon man, why are fan games better than your official ones?",,
"This is the most 7/10 game I've played in a while. It definely has problems and lacks quite a bit of polish, but there are a lot of cool ideas I wanna see Sonic Team iterate in the future and potentially turn this concept into a 9/10. As it is it's just ""alright"", but considering how rough Sonic had it with Forces, it's more than what I could ask for.

- Basic story that gets extremely rushed by the end and has the most disappointing last boss I've played in a good while. Yes, I did play on hard mode.
- Great character writing. Sonic's back to being an overconfident little guy and it's great.
- Decent gameplay. Open zones are fun (if not a bit repetitive) and cyberspace as a whole has decent level design, though unpolished as this game is it has a little bit of jank to both modes. Please mod Enhanced Dropdash into your game.
- Decent visuals even if art direction looks weird. Still looks like a tech demo on the overworld, but cyberspace looks great.

I do have some gripes with this game though. The complete lack of momentum (outside of rail jumping), the constant nostalgia bait on cyberspace (and the general lack of new levels as a whole) and I guess how janky it feels as a whole. Like I said, this game is unpolished and it feels like it, although still perfectly playable. I hope I'm not making this sound like it's a Cyberpunk situation, it's not.

Overall, it's a 7/10 game, and a pretty good Sonic game overall.

I'd rather not mention mods into reviews like these since I'd rather have the vanilla game to stand on it's own merits, but mods definely changed the experience for the better for me and I'm gonna do some reccommendations if you're feeling like modding your game. Setting up hedgemodmanager is pretty easy and gives you tons of options.

- Enhanced Dropdash: The vanilla Dropdash straight up doesn't work sometimes, this mod not only fixes those issues but enhances the move exponentially, all while being extremely customizable. I'd say, out of this list, this one is the only ""must-have"".
- Tracker's Physics Tweaks: Adds momentum back into the game and was specifically designed to not break the game's level design. Works on both the overworld and cyberspace and also includes some pretty neat toggable minor combat tweaks.
- True Physics: Similar to Tracker's, it enhances the game by adding momentum back into it and designing it around the game's level design, trying to not break it. It's a bit more robust, with velocity-based animations and better slope mechanics, but it only works on the overworld for starters. You can make it work in cyberspace, but it'll take a bit more effort (involves merging mods together).
- Combat DX: Overhauls the game's combat to be a bit more intricate without changing too much of it. Has combo ranks and combo trees, but makes enemies a bit too spongey. Would also need merging if using alongside physics mods.
- No Cutscenes After Challenges: Every time you do a map challenge, the game will stop to show you your reward and what part of the map you unlocked. Since it's unskippable, it gets pretty grating after 10 or so hours. This mod skips it, just make sure to set the option to still show the map after you complete a challenge or otherwise it won't count towards map completion.
- Quick Boot: Self explanatory. Just boots you into your desired menu faster, make sure to configure it accordingly and read the instructions.
- Improved Arcade UI: Better descriptions for stages in the Arcade menu.

There are also codes in hedgemodmanager that enhances the game without having to download anything. My favorites are:

- Bouncy Ball Jump: Reintroduces the cute little squash n' stretch jumpball from Forces. Looks great.
- Disable Running Fall: I personally dislike how Sonic would keep running in the air after falling off a ledge. Some say it's to pay homage to the old Genesis games, but I just think it looks odd and unfinished. This makes so Sonic transitions into his falling animation instead.
- Homing Attack Trick Animations: Reintroduces trick animations after homing attacks by randomizing the in-game trick poses.
- Fix Grind Leaning: Grind leaning animations look a bit odd, this fixes it.
- Drop Dash on Double Jump: Makes so you don't have to press jump three times to dropdash.
- Retain Ground Velocity After Jump: HUGE improvement over the old jump. Makes so your ground momentum carries over to jumps.
- Tighter Jump Rotation: Makes jumps more controllable, though this is a bit of a hit or miss. See if you like it.

That's it. The game's good but these made the experience much better.",,
"The new update quite literally ruined my memories of the game on release by making me realize that the game just doesn't control well and the bosses that were already in the game range from repetitive and boring when doing it right and frustrating when you make any mistake.
The Boss Rush either goes ""Wait until the enemy attacks you and parry and if you fail you have to wait 5 million years to do attempt it again if you want to do any amount of damage"" or ""Just Cyloop them and make the fight literally a joke"" either way you'll be spamming the same two buttons over and over with nothing encouraging me to use other moves.
I haven't even BEATEN the final boss after hours of trying everything I could think of because I quite literally cannot hit the thing the game wants me to hit because it just doesn't lock on to it no matter what and I have only been able to hit it once after the game randomly just let me.
The new characters are fine; Amy feels the most fun, Knuckles is fine until you start gliding where he has a startup that feels way too long with the controls feeling like you're controlling a garbage truck, and Tails just let's you fly anywhere you want over everything if you have the mech and even if you don't he still can easily just fly over entire challenges that are supposed to be built for him.
The ""difficulty"" goes from hard because the game just randomly expects so much of you or just isn't working and when it is working it's brainless button mashing in an instant.
I think I only thought this game was good when I was just feeling the presentation of the fights and wasn't thinking about how the gameplay wasn't all that interesting to begin with.

Edit: I finally finished the game after finally figuring out the literal one button I was missing that was really unintuitive and I still stand by everything I said. I feel like I enjoyed the original extra final boss more.",,
"This is the most nostalgic and entertaining sonic game I've ever played after sonic adventure 1, 2 and sonic mania. Truly a masterpiece and I'm looking forward to the bug fixes and updates coming to the game. If there won't be any new content, I'm genuinely still satisfied. Much love to Sega for this one <3",,

"Probably it contention for best 3D Sonic game, low bar I know but its a legitimately good game and if Sonic Team can iterate out some of the lingering issues in the sequel that might be a legitimately amazing game.",,
The only thing that I didn't like in this game is the final boss on medium difficulty. It was just too easy asdhasjd. So I reccomend to change difficulty level to hard when your finishing game.,,
"Did it look kinda unpolished when I bought it? Yes.
Are there a few flaws [with the 2D portions]? Yes.
Am I having fun? Yes.
This game is actually really addictive. I sat down, playing this on my Steam Deck, for like almost 3 hours straight. (I play on low settings, 60FPS limited to 40. Butter.)
I will update this once I finish the game. If you ever played the older 3D games, the jank won’t bother you too much. It isn’t perfect, but it’s pretty darn good.",,
"This is a fantastic game and I wholly recommend it. Sonic makes a great transition to open world style gameplay here, and for me it's the good parts of the Adventure games but with even more to do. The RPG mechanics are simple but allow for clever and satisfying combat, the islands are a treat to explore, and the story is engaging. This is a must for any Sonic fan-- it's been a long time since Sonic characters have been treated with the respect they have here in-game.



I'll keep it spoiler-free. The story is centered around the Chaos Emeralds and this abandoned civilization that possibly even predated the Echidna tribe. The story's tone is akin to the Adventure games and heavily references them as well, but there are call backs to all sorts of other games too, and you can tell that this game serves to straighten out the canon. With respect to the seriousness too, the game is also not afraid to get silly and the times it does are pleasant and fun surprises.

All the characters have a chance to shine and it's a joy to watch their interactions with one another. There's also more depth given to Eggman and his relationship with his creations, which I felt added a lot too (and will likely continue thematically in future games). The mystery of the story itself I found to be engaging and I thought it was all well written.

This is major copium but the game itself felt like they were laying down the groundwork for a lot of future story and gameplay elements (like the frequently requested Chao Gardens). While none of that has paid off yet, I still think this game does a lot well and stands very well on its own. This is the first time in a long time where I've beaten a game and I'm excited to see the next one come out.



Sonic is placed in open zones, which are huge islands consisting of different terrain. The rails and springs and all that good stuff seem random at first, but as you play more you see how it all fits together and flows from one location to the next. Sonic feels great to control and he can be very, very fast. The combat is simple at first, but gets more and more complex as you unlock more skills and they feel satisfying to master. The combat is genuinely fun, and it shines the most when fighting guardians (mini-bosses) and titans (the huge boss when completing each island).

Sonic doesn't control as well in the cyber space stages, but these stages are pretty short, easy to master, and are good breaks from the open world exploration. The 3D stages are the most fun and put your skills to the test to get that coveted S rank, too.

If there is any gameplay element you don't like or find too grindy or difficult, then my man Big the Cat has got your back. There is a fishing zone on each island, and the fishing mini-game is fun, relaxing, and VERY rewarding. Catching fish gives you currency that you can trade with Big in exchange for pretty much anything in the game other than Chaos Emeralds themselves. Big is your best friend in 100%ing the game and you can also get a full fishing encyclopedia. Also, you can buy lore!

Final note: I beat this game on Hard, and it was, well, hard sometimes, but coming from someone who never plays hard mode in games, it was extremely enjoyable. There is not a different ending on the difficulties, but the final battles in the game are different, so I recommend playing it on Hard or switching it in the final battle.



It goes HARD. Sonic games always have slapping music and this is NO EXCEPTION. From somber piano, to upbeat EDM, to dubstep, to ""lo-fi beats to relax and fish to"", to HARD METAL this game has it all and it does it SO well. This might be my favorite OST in any Sonic game which is saying a lot because I am a GIANT fan of Sonic OSTs.



I don't have many negatives. The biggest one for me is that the layout for the cyber space stages are tired and overdone at this point-- I'm sick of seeing Green Hill Zone aesthetics and i'm sick of the formula that Generations introduced with nostalgia in mind. That being said, I never felt like I was getting nostalgia baited and the callbacks in the game are done well.

People have been complaining about pop-ins and like, yeah, that happens, but the only island where I noticed this and had it affect me was on the third island. Otherwise, it didn't bug me and I hardly noticed while playing.

There are a few times where I'd go zipping off a large enemy or I'd get frustrated with climbing, but this didn't happen enough to hamper my experience overall.



Please support this game if anything I said here sounds like a good time to you. Sonic Team is on the right track with this one and I hope they can make even bigger and better projects down the line too. I loved this game and if it had a Chao Garden it would've annihilated Sonic Adventure 2 as my favorite Sonic game, but this is still pretty high up there. Give Sonic Frontiers a chance!",,
"Finally had time to 100% the game on hard mode on my first play-through and what a treat that was. Cyberspace levels are short as heck but fun just wish the controls were the same as in the open zone. Story was actually very decent and enjoyable.
Like most sonic games Sonic Frontiers is an album that just happens to come with a really good game because the soundtrack was fire. overall game beautiful and fun... 8/10 highly recommend it",,
"This game has been fun to play around in, but...

The Sonic franchise started life as a game that let the player play with momentum and speed. The original Sonics made you work to get up to speed and maintain it. This Frontiers exchanges that for very ""light"" almost floaty controls that leave Sonic feeling weightless. ""Press R to go zoom"" robs the movement system of depth. This leaves the game designers to add rails, springs, and boosters everywhere to keep the movement interesting. This design choice only serves to compound the next problem.

The original games game also existed as a tech demos to show off the capabilities of the much more powerful Sega consoles compared to their slower and more popular Nintendo counter parts. The speed of the gameplay was recognized as a technical challenge. That recognition was lost with Frontiers. Today there is a TON of pop in. To the point where I have failed to figure out how to get somewhere because the rail or running walls I needed to get there would consistently pop into existence behind me as I whizzed by them. The engine they are using just cannot keep up with the travel speed. Instead of the game showing off a technical accomplishment I feels like Sonic got dropped into an unoptimized Unreal Engine demo.

All in all it has been fun, but the lack of polish made what could have been a GREAT game just good.",,
"Ultiamtely i went into this game afraid of it being another bad sonic game, but after playing it and getting all the achievements i see this game is truly awesome, the open world is filled with many things to do, the story is worth listening too and well written, to the point i care about these characters again, the cyberspace levels were actually pretty cool even if they reused levels. but your main amount of time will be in the open world and seeing the wonderfulness of the star islands.",,

I seriously never fallen so much in love with a Sonic game since the 4Kids era games and Generations. The game is THAT good! The real Sonic is really back after 11 years of disappointments after Colours ruined it all. Reccomend for all Sonic and gaming fans new and old!,,
"This game is truly a work of art, and is really what the description says. I’ve never in any previous games, been able to do all sorts of extraordinary things before as sonic and simply do what ever the ♥♥♥♥ you want. Even if it means collecting rings, running around from point A to point B or annihilating guardians off-missions for fun in a free, open world with all of sonic’s devastating powers. Speaking of powers, as you progress through the game and collect more skill points, you unlock and possess more powerful abilities to make your game experience far more exciting besides traditional homing attack powers. I hope SEGA create more sonic games in the future just like this, as this is just what we’ve always been waiting for.",,
"One heck of an improvement from Forces, I finished every nook and cranny of the game. Even if there wasn't an achievement with the task.

Pros
+ Really good story for a change, having Ian Flynn directing the story is a great change from the traditional happy go lucky or try hard at being eddy Sonic stories.
+ Great music as always, brings me back to my days of a high school student if you listen to the Titan Boss themes.
+ Looks solid, sure i'm not the biggest graphics hog, but i see some issues but it's still solid.
+ I enjoyed the somber and moody atmosphere the game provides
+ Nice variety of bosses and enemies to fight, while simple, you can craft some fun fights with what you got.
+ It's pretty meaty for a Sonic game, if you want to 100% the game it can take 20 or more hours. Most Sonic games are no where close to that.
+ You can fish in a Sonic game.

Cons
- Graphical pop-in as people have shown, makes finding collectibles a pain in the butt sometimes cause you cant find where the course starts to get memory tokens.
- Cyberspace levels are underwhelming, Sonic's abilities are different in the levels so it's jarring, especially since you will be in the worlds more than Cyberspace, although you can play your cards right and never touch Cyberspace.
- The game likes to jump between 2D and 3D depending on the course, and it can really be frustrating to get around when your shoved into a 2D section. Island 3 is full of this nonsense.
- The secret final boss is underwhelming, especially since you had 3 prior final bosses of an island that were epic as heck.",,
"First good game since Unleashed (besides Generations and Colors), and first game that actually takes itself seriously and has a deep and engaging story and not some cringefest like Forces and previous entries.

Aka, the only good sonic we gotten in many years, therefore highly recommend",,
"Easily one of the best Sonic games as of recent. There is a surprising amount to do in this game and the writing is good as opposed to previous games. There is loads of story and lore hidden around the map, challenges, even fishing. There are some spectacular boss fights as well. If you are a Sonic fan you should seriously play this game.

Overall,

Pros

Good story.
Huge sprawling areas that are enjoyable to run in.
Improving on characters depth like Knuckles for instance.
Amazing Soundtrack as usual for a Sonic Game, probably one of the best with songs like
Plenty of engaging boss fights with good animations.
Very Enjoyable Minibosses.
Enjoyable combat and return of moves from previous games such as the Drop Dash.
Secrets to find around in the World like the
Cosmetics to wear like the Rathalos armor, SA2 Soap Shoes, and more.
Made me cry.


Pop In.
Denuvo. This may not affect performance as much depending on device
Glitches
Collecting can get a bit boring. Prepare for a huge Collectathon
Occasional Lag sometimes, YMMV on this one.
Not much postgame. Sonic games typically don't have postgame so this is not unusual.
Fishing is overpowered and so is the Monster Hunter DLC.
Some people may not like the Cyber Space Levels which involve 2D and 3D Platforming.
Digital Deluxe Edition skips progression.


The game is amazing and despite all its flaws, Its probably the best Sonic game that we have had in a long time and it was a huge blast. I could definitely see this game getting some great DLC later on, and I think it is safe to say that you should definitely try this.",,

Sonic May Cry 6,,
"Sonic Frontiers is, ultimately, a great game that lays a framework with a lot potential, but rough around the edges.

The open world aspect works well with Sonic's speed, and there is plenty to do in the open zone to get tokens and stat ups. Generally, these require going through a little nibble of a Sonic stage, but are fun to do. Also since Sonic is....Sonic, you can quickly go to point a to point b and even chain some of these bites of stages together. Those looking for a more complete Sonic stage experience can find it in Cyber Space stages. Almost all of these pull ideas from previous Sonic games, all the way back to SA2 even. Each one has a handful of missions; Get all red rings, get S rank, and clear with a certain amount of rings. All are relatively comfortable to get (except S Rank on 1-2 who the hell tuned this stage). Music is some of the best in a series already known for amazing music.

Bosses are some of the best in the series, and when the music drops for the first major boss you will probably be pleasantly surprised and you will FEEL it. Combat as a whole is...not super deep but not super shallow. It is a lot of ""press X repeatedly"" here but there are some other moves you can perform mid combo.

The game isn't perfect though. Obviously the biggest thing is pop-in; things just unexist if you are 50f away. It's a problem, especially when paths to get to Emeralds and such can stretch for a *while*; the tiny render distance can obscure what you may be looking for. Pop-in isn't my only issue though. Stats feel unimpactful; I genuinely couldn't feel a difference between 1 and 99 speed or defense, and barely anything for attack. I think the scale is too high and probably work better as a 1-25 system instead of 1-99. Combat may feel good, but there aren't many enemies that require you to really use the full combat system besides the area bosses. Even in the final island, most mini bosses died before Phantom Rush was even ready, and this was on hard. On control, while it's fine or even great in most places, I find 2d sections to be less so. This seems to mostly stem from how, even on a 2d plane, Sonic must rotate entirely to change directly. It doesn't feel snappy and it killed me on more than one occasion. And overall the fomula is the same for each island, so gameplay may feel repetitive.

All that said, I did greatly enjoy my time with Sonic Frontiers and it's been the best 3d Sonic game I've played since the Dreamcast/Gamecube era. It definitely needs polish, and I think Sega needs to rethink the RPG elements more finely, but overall this gameplay style has a lot of potential for future releases and got me to be actually excited for future Sonic games in 2022. Imagine that.

I'm gonna go play Ikaruga now.",,
10/10 game you get to play as sonic,,
The game is cool but the optimisation is realy bad :( (the optimisation is better now),,
"There is some jankiness with a couple things here and there that everyone can notice/feel since it's a new direction. Final boss felt lack luster compared to all of the other bosses: the game is pretty much an 8 outta 10 overall.

With that being said: RAW. FIRE. DELICIOUS. PEAK SONIC GAME. FUN AF. OST SLAPPING HARDER THAN EVER

"I'm a longtime Sonic fan, this series being the first I ever played at 4 years old, but sadly, I think this is where I move on. This game isn't necessarily the WORST Sonic game ever made, but its probably my least favourite. For all the reasons to hate Sonic '06, at least that game was actually trying, however; Frontiers eschews all that in favour of trend chasing, and it doesn't even do that particularly well. I'm sure there are plenty of people who will get along with this, but all I found here was a dull, bland open world collectathon with tonal issues and an inherent misunderstanding of what Sonic's charm was.",,
"I'll be picking this game up when it's on sale. I've had more fun with most other indie platformers for less than $20. I cannot in good faith spend $60 on this game. Maybe I'm missing something.

When the game inevitably goes on sale for like $19.99 I'll pick it up. Until then I'll just keep playing the games I already have.

Spam X to attack.
Open World controls are wack, Goofy Gravity and Momentum.
Readjusting to land tight platforming is sometimes near impossible because if the turn radius.
It's just a bunch of Linear Sonic Levels strung together with lame puzzles in an ""open zone""

The only reason they called this game ""Open Zone"" is because they know they didn't have content for calling it an ""Open World"" game.",,

"Sonic Frontiers is a wonderful mess that rekindled my love for this franchise!
It honestly feels like a fever dream but I love this game and now it's one of my top 3 sonic games. It is surprising but Sonic Team managed to show me why I love this blue hedgehog and why I keep playing his games.

I love Sonic games because I want to explore and use the level geometry to my advantage and Frontiers does exactly that. It gives me a lot of opportunities to use shortcuts and even tickles my imagination to explore for them. This is by far my favorite feature of this game and on top of that I am also getting a Sonic Adventure 3 story with an amazing OST.

However, every modern sonic game needs some downsides and that's why it has a lot of 3D-Gameplay jank and Pop-ins. They are even so frequent that it has a very high likelihood to ruin your immersion and maybe break the game for you! However, if you can look past all of those issues, you will have the time of your life with Sonic Frontiers.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is, at it's core, an act of sheer desperation. At times it feels like the developers had no idea what was gonna appease the fans so they just took literally every idea they had and just threw it into a pot frantically in hopes that SOMETHING good might come out of it. And against all odds something kinda did? This game is better than it has any right to be. It's got a lot of cool ideas. And even though not every idea sticks the landing enough of them do that the game comes out shining brighter than sonic has shone in a very long time.

The open world sections are this anxiety inducing mess of big open fields littered with rails and springs and boost pads that look like they go nowhere but are bafflingly all connected to some form of platforming challenge for you to complete. Most of them are well made, most of them are unfortunately also very poorly placed. As fun as these sections were to run through I found it was way too easy to accidentally bump into a spring or a boost pad I didn't mean to hit and suddenly I am now flung halfway across the map against my will. It was fine at first as I was kind of getting a feel for things and was more keen on just going wherever the game wanted to take me but as I got further into the game this became more and more annoying. Yes I think these platform segments are fun, I think MOST of them are pretty well designed and I appreciate that there are an impressive amount of the. But also being forced into them because I hit a box I didn't know had a spring in it while boosting my way to a specific objective is kinda super frustrating. It's frustrating how often the game seems to want to wrestle control away from me by either restricting my camera angle or thrusting me into another rail leading to god only knows where while I'm trying to figure out where the next linear level is.

Speaking of the linear levels they kinda suck super hard? Like are we really just doing fifteen different flavors of green hill, chemical plant and sky sanctuary again? A huge amount of the level layouts even were peiced together from other sonic games. The first time I played a level and went ""HEY THAT'S JUST LIKE THE THING FROM SONIC ADVENTURE 2"" it was cute. The 4th time it just felt like pandering. I'm a fan of a good retro callback but it feels excessively used here. I cannot express in words how genuinely sick of green hill zone I am. On top of that, the controls in these linear levels feels off. They clearly aren't using the same movement psysics as the rest of the game and it's kinda jarring the first few times. They butchered homing attack by adding a really gross delay to chaining enemies and the momentum feels really sticky, Sonic seems to just suddenly grind to a screeching halt at times and it's a little offputting. This was especially prevalent on the 2D levels more than the 3D levels but both of them were a little jank. That said with the exception of a few levels getting S ranks on these stages was absurdly easy, most of them you can just boost through like half the stage with little to no consequence. So at the very least these only account for maybe 4 hours out of my 25 hour experience.

I'm becoming increasingly aware that it sounds like I hated this game. I didn't. I actually had a lot of fun with the game. I found the controls in the open world section of the game to be fluid and responsive. Despite the platforming challenges being hidden around like lego in a kids bedroom I think most of them were really well thought out and fun. The music in this game goes tremendously hard. Combat is GOOD which is a thing I didn't think I'd ever say about a Sonic game??? The game is full of these dumb minigames and challenges that in any other game would be cumbersome and out of place but they feel weirdly charming and fun here. The game kinda feels like an old school 3d collectathon where you're just thrown into this playground with a million different flavors of challenges and even though some of those challenges kinda suck the vast majority of them, and the journey of actually encountering them all, are both just tremendously endearing.

I think Frontiers is a step in the right direction for Sonic. It doesn't alway do everything right, but they are tying something new here and I think there's more good than bad. Also credit where credit is due when they announced that they were making an ""open world"" Sonic game I thought that sounded dumb as hell. Early gameplay that got shown looked super rough and I honestly only decided to give the game a shot when I heard there were at least going to be regular linear levels on top of the open world stuff and the levels they showed off looked pretty clean and fun. As irony would have it, the part I thought would be good ended up sucking and the part I thought would suck ended up being way better than it had any right to be. Go figure.",,
"I was very on the fence between thumbs up and thumbs down on this one. This game takes a lot of steps in the right directions, can be decently fun, and I'll likely play more of it at some point, but it just feels kind of hollow. The environments of the ""open zones"" feel like some Unreal Engine tech demo that they just threw Sonic into and aren't very interesting or unique. Sonic feels uncannily out of place in them and they're largely forgettable. The linear levels have better level design and art and can be a pretty good time. All in all though most time is gonna be spent roaming the open world and that wears thing about halfway into the first zone. I was pretty over it by the time I got to the desert. There's also some weird quirks that hold things back. The combat is fine I guess, it's not Devil May Cry but it's passable beat 'em up combat. Homing attack has been remapped to the attack button, which is fine, but chaining homing attacks on enemies in quick succession is a thing of the past, causing it to feel much more sluggish. It seems that they wanted to rework homing attack to be a combo starter, which is fine enough, but after a kill it'd be nice to be able to chain more of them. The drop dash from Sonic Mania is here, which would actually pretty be awesome if the input didn't seem to not work two thirds of the time. One pretty neat thing is that in the open zones, Sonic gets a speed boost when at the maximum number of rings, but when you enter this state it plays an unskippable cutscene. Every. Single. Time.

Sonic Frontiers isn't exactly a bad game. But it's not a good game either. It's junk food. A game that some people may find comfortable enough to want to kill an extended period of time with. It's not inspired and it's not offensive. Play this one if you want some mindless busywork to occupy your free time and it seems like an enjoyable delivery system for that. Otherwise, I'd skip it.",,
This game surprisingly runs on my PC. It's pretty good. Will probably change this as I come closer to completion,,
"Great game BUT with some caveats!


TLDR: This game is fun but very janky in multiple ways and generally could use a bit more time in the oven. Thankfully using mods like HedgeModManager fixes most major issues.

UPDATE: Using HedgeModManager fixes the FPS cap and most performance issues I had with the game. I'd still pass on this if all you have is a Steam Deck.

If you are a Sonic fan, you should play this game. You probably didn't need me to tell you that. This is the Good Sonic Game you probably want that we've been waiting forever for.

This is a great game in its own right plagued by terrible marketing. Though it obviously borrows a lot of elements from other recent open world games, it does feel like a Sonic game first with all the open-world obstacles scattered everywhere. Honestly just traversing the landscape feels great, although I do wish Sonic could run up more walls. Worth mentioning: at first Sonic controls very loosely, but surprisingly you can change Sonic's physics parameters in the Options menu. I immediately set his turn-rate (and other params) to the minimum, and Sonic turns on a dime now and handles great.

The game starts to fall apart at the seams due to limitations of its engine. This is really apparent when you start doing things it doesn't expect, like running over certain patches of rough terrain, where Sonic will clip awkwardly and start falling, or other physics oddities. Additionally, there's some other odd choices like the 60fps cap. On some wall-running portions (certain boss fights, levels, etc.), Sonic tends to fly off into space if you don't hit the angle juuuuust right. This isn't anything new if you've played Sonic before, but it still feels like some of these portions could've been tightened up a little to play better. Also, you've probably noticed, but the pop-in is indeed jarring and annoying.

If you ONLY have a Steam Deck, I would actually avoid this game as it runs pretty terribly at the native 800p. It has a seizure-like flickering due to a lighting bug, which can only be fixed by sticking a 30fps cap on the game. Even trying to run the game at Lowest settings like this is really a chore and doesn't play great at all -- it looks bad and it's hard to tell what you're looking at. If you own both a Steam Deck and a desktop, you can stream from the Desktop to your Deck, which runs pretty well but you'll run into stream artifacts depending on your network connection.

This is a shame because it's pretty obvious the game wasn't ready for launch but SEGA pulled the trigger since they have to hit those holiday sales numbers. Oh well. At least they nailed the Persona 5 port.",,

"This game is definitely in my top 5. It has room to improve but what it nails, it does with flying colors. The writing is amazing, the lore incorporation is amazing, and the music is on point as usual. I give this game a solid 8/10 PS... SEGA.... LET IAN FLYNN WRITE FOR FUTURE GAMES!!!",,
"One of the best Sonic games Sonic Team has put out in years, and certainly the most ambitious game of theirs in a long, LONG time. It's pretty damn good. The repetition might be an issue depending on how you approach the game, and it has glaring issues like the Cyberspace levels being levels we know and love with more limited abilities, as well as the lack of replayability, but the entire experience has been a blast, and one that has reminded me of why I still care about this silly blue rodent.",,
Do not buy if you have a rog ally or any other handheld Sega broke the game and it will not run on any igpu at all this game is broken for all igpu zen chipset gpu,,
"Sonic.
A blue hedgehog which is undefeatable
He breaks through them all and finds your flame
And MOST IMPORTANTLY HE'S HERE

Also SAGE MY BELOVED",,
"Finally, a good one. Very much enjoyed my time with Sonic Automata.",,
"After having completed the entire campaign I can say that it is one of the best sonic games, it has everything.
First, the gameplay feels incredibly good, obviously since it is the first time we see this, it has its flaws, but in general it is very well done.

Second the plot is very engaging at least for me a lot of new lore and it's really good.

Third, the soundtrack that I don't need to say anything is simply incredible.

Fourth, the bosses are very good, all very entertaining, and seeing Super Sonic in this way is simply a work of art, extremely powerful.

If I had to say something that I didn't like, it's that sometimes in the open world in the 2d parts they annoy since some of them until you pass them completely you can't go back to ""3d"".


The best sonic game, even better than unleashed....:

Recommended :D",,
"What I like
* Open world feels nice
* Controls feel great (finally!)
* Game looks great; for the most part.
* Music is god tier.

What I am indifferent about
* Combat isn't very fun and feels stiff but its doable.
* New voice acting style feels weird but it could be worse.
* I haven't finished story but pacing seems kind of weird to me? Might just be me.

What I dislike
* 2D cyberspace levels are god awful. They are abnormally slow except in spin tunnels.
* Platforming isn't perfect. Your shadow will appear on top of a platform yet you will still miss it.
--

I'd rate it a 7 out of 10, which is basically a miracle for Sonic these days. I wish the combat felt better, as it is a big part of this game. But if you can deal with it I'd say the exploration and general sonic speeding is worth it. I think this is the best Sonic fans are going to get. Its not a masterpiece but its fun.",,
"peakest game after update 3

remove denuvo tho it stuttered my game a lot of times",,
"When you play by yourself, the game feels completely different. So do not look at the opinions of other people, play for yourself and you will understand that the game is in your hands, it feels completely different.",,
"While nowhere near perfect on a technical level, it is clear that the developers put a lot of heart into making a fresh and exciting Sonic experience.
The soundtrack is amazing, the character interactions are funny and thoughtful and the bossfights are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crazy :D

If you enjoyed Sonic Generations you're going to feel at home here!",,
"it's a good step in the right direction for the Sonic the Hedgehog series, It just lets it down with repetitive game-play loops and automated level design. but that said I had a lot of fun playing this new entry in the Sonic series and I thought it was a massive step up from previous games my main issue with this game is how it controls I wish it was more momentum-based like sonic adventure or any of the classic games it would be more fun if sonic didn't have a capped speed and you can utilise the terrain and your surroundings to gain and build up speed but I can see what SEGA was going for when tackling the controls it very easy to pick up and play even if your new to sonic you could probably get to grips with the simple control scheme which is a good thing for new players wanting to get into sonic still it would have been nice to see a momentum option in the settings. it is weird too because the drop dash is part of sonic's movement which I'm happy to see it was a blast using it in Mania but its inclusion here seems forced and not needed as sonic's boot button gives you instant speed it just seems like its there for the sake of it rather then it building upon sonic's movement options. To activate it is also weird you need to press the A button 3 times just to activate it I only realised it was in the game when I made it onto the third island overall I think it isn't all that useful it can be fun to pull off in certain instances but other than that it's just not needed if the game is not built around momentum another big thing that was sorely missing in this game is sonic's iconic spin dash move they bother with the drop dash but completely forgot about the spin-dash which confuses me.
Another big problem with this game is. and I hate to say it because I think we can all agree that the pop-in is just annoying it's already annoying trying to find the dam collectables it just makes it more annoying when the platform you are supposed to get on has not loaded in yet so it isn't really clear how you are supposed to get to certain places. this game also uses a lot of previously used level tropes and designs that have become a bore to come back to like green hill and chemical plant I think we are getting sick of seeing the same level tropes and ideas over and over again but other than that thought the cyberspace levels were pretty fun it a nice change of pace from the open zone game-play and the levels are nice and short so they don't take to much of your time and that goes for Bigs fishing mini-game as well.

it may look like I'm ripping into this game a lot but I really had fun with this game and it has the potential to be even better I feel like if this game had more time in the oven it would be even better but I'm still happy with what we got, in the end, pick this game up if you have not tried it out and if your curious the music is amazing and the plot is a good step up from previous games in the franchise I'm excited for the future for Sonic and I hope SEGA keeps up the good work",,
"An amazing step in the right direction. While not everything is perfect, it gets a lot of things right and pushes Sonic in a much needed new direction.

Pros:
- Amazing fluidity in the open world when it comes to movement and level design.
- Inspired level design within the Cyber Space levels. Short and sweet, but the multi challenges allow for multiple playthroughs to get a 100% completion rank. Also nice call backs to previous Sonic levels.
- Curiosity is rewarded pretty heavily. One puzzle leads to the next very nicely. I found myself sidetracked heading to destinations.
- The story and vocal direction are truly top tier for the series in recent memory. Keep Ian Flynn, SEGA. PLEASE.
- The music is a HUGE step up from past titles. Bringing in new genres as well as perfecting others not so new to the series.
- The boss fights, while a bit clunky sometimes, are just too rad to be mad at. Some of the best in the series. Also pretty nice to see Super Sonic more often than just at the end of a game.
- The mini-games + fishing are SO refreshing. Love me some Big.

Cons:
- While the realistic scenery was a nice change of pace, the themes for each island don't vary much. I never found myself super excited about being on any of the islands, though the atmosphere was nice at times.
- While Sonic controls amazing in the open world, the Cyber Space version ends up feeling a tad sluggish, but more so stiff in the 3D sections. The great level design helps the flow, and 2D sections feel pretty good, I found some frustration when turning or moving in certain sections.
- Some inconsistency within the RPG elements. While leveling up ATK/DEF was fluid and instant, you have to manually upgrade speed and ring count one by one. It takes, no kidding, probably close to 30 minutes overall or more to upgrade both to max if you have all the resources. The skill tree is basic, while very cool for a first attempt, ends up having some issues with combat fluidity. Feels good but could def use improvement. Not to mention the fact I was able to max it out about 4 hours in outside of the story skills you get. Skills points then stack up with no function after that. Among small other inconsistencies, the RPG elements are a welcome addition, just fairly clunky in it's approach.
- While the story and lore are amazing, it ends up feeling like it just ends, even with the hard mode ending. Still an incredible story, I just wish there was more.
- Currently no NEW GAME+ option or anything extra for 100% completion. Bosses are also locked out and require a new game to revisit them again.

Bonus Points:
- Arcade Mode was an awesome touch.
- They could've charged for the SOAP Shoes DLC, but were free with a news letter sub. Wish Sonic kept them in his design because they look SO much better on Modern Sonic than his default classic kicks.

- - - - -

Overall, an amazing first attempt at a new formula. Would def recommend, especially to Adventure era fans.",,
Finally a decent 3D Sonic game after a long time.,,
changed me and my life for the better,,
oh my god.,,
Sonic Adventure 3?!?!??!?!!!,,
For some reason when going into the options and going all the way down it crashes your game. But otherthan that the game is really fun to play,,
Most boring open world experience I've had. Not memorable at all in a good way.,,
"Sonic Frontiers is a good game (7/10)
The combat is fluid and there are some truly awesome fights with well designed mechanics.
The open world areas are fun to explore and collect the myriad of items, but the ""classic"" time trial zones are so much more interesting with a more traditional Sonic gameplay.
The controls are solid, though it suffers from some forced camera perspective issues during certain sequences.
The story and voice acting is sub-par for a Triple-A title, which honestly is the worst part of the game for me.",,
"This is the best Mainline Sonic Game we have gotten in a while, but by no means this game is perfect.
The game has flaws, but its a step in the right direction.
i'm excited to see what lies ahead in the future of this series",,
"It’s time to face your fear

Cause when your time has come and gone

I’ll be the one to carry on

You can throw me to the wolves

Cause I am undefeatable

I’m hanging on to the other side

I won’t give up ’til the end of me

I’m what you get when the stars collide

Now face it, you’re just an enemy

Oh yeah the game good",,
"Just finished this game.
Woah. Sonic's truly back.
The final fight wasn't what it should've been, but it was good nonetheless.
The credit song made me cry. Legitimately.
Speedrunning Cyberspace is a lotta fun! I got really into it, currently sitting at a 43.50s time in 1-2!
I love y'all, Sonic Team, for delivering us this experience. You've truly made me happy.

Thank you.






(Older, more in-depth review:)

3 hours in: here we go!

Sonic Frontiers is a step in the right direction. Sonic feels incredible when moving around and the combat feels smooth.
Sonic in an open world works really well and I can imagine Sonic Team expanding on this concept.

The game, as fun and well made it is, also has its flaws:
1. There are bugs. I've glitched through a huge enemy once, and when talking to the Elder and Hermit Coco, Sonic's voicelines don't play.
2. Cyber Space isn't consistent; Sonic's speed varies massively between different levels. Cyber Space controls also feel, well, off. They're really fun nonetheless.
3. The Voice acting is, well fine... Smith is a good Sonic, but Amy in particular sounds off.
4. Yes, there's a lot of pop in. But if you don't look for it, you'll barely notice.

(Keep in mind: This is release day and a lot of bugs will be fixed in no time.)

But now, let's move on to the good stuff:
1. The game's story is well made and possibly one of Sonic's greatest adventures yet.
2. Open World controls feel INCREDIBLE and work perfectly.
3. The huge variety of movement controls lets you customize Sonic to your liking.
4. The Open World graphics are very good. Not breathtaking, but very good.
5. The SFX Design is really good and really immersive.
6. ...As is the VFX Design.
7. Side Quests and Minigames are fun and interesting.
8. The animation in this game is SO. DAMN. GOOD.
9. Cyber Space graphics are BEAUTIFUL!
10. The mechanics work well and are great for newcomers and fans.
11. The enemy and character design
12. Despite the OK Voice Acting, the characters really embrace their personalities in this game.
13. Sonic is FAST. Like REALLY FAST. He really feels like our beloved blue speedy hedgehog.
14. The music. It really conveys the mysterious feeling of the Starfall Islands.
15. The open world is full of stuff to do and you won't get bored.

In conclusion:
Sonic Frontiers is fun, well written and beautiful looking. Despite a few bugs and flaws, the overall gameplay is engaging and makes you feel like YOU ARE Sonic. If you're a fan of the series, or trying to find something new: This game is for you and won't disappoint.
Hopefully you'll have a great time with the game, because I certainly did.",,
we finally won sonicbros,,
"This videogame is a sonic fan's dream!!! Please, please, please play this game because it's some of the most fun in the Sonic Series!!!!!",,
Massive W for Sonic fans. If you're a fan of Sonic and aren't playing this game or haven't played this game you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ up. We back baby,,
I think there's something really captivating about the way you move through this game. I really love the challenge that the Final Horizon update brings too.,,
I want so much to enjoy this.. but between the repetitive nature and the wonky mechanics i had such a hard time. Mostly I was just so overly frustrated that you biggest enemy in this game is the camera. It really does actively try to fight you and you spend so much of your time trying just pulled into a different view outside of your control. I can't in good faith recommend it. Appreciate the attempt but the execution is lacking,,
"(Spoiler Free!)

So! New sonic game!

... I liked it!

Sonic Frontiers is a new step for the series, and a step in the right direction for once, hehe. The open zone gameplay is really fun, Sonic controls really well, and you can pull off some crazy stuff once you master the movement. Yeah, there's none of that coveted 'momentum', but the game still has a pretty good flow to it. Visually, the game looks quite on par with the likes of Unleashed (save for a few of the cutscenes, the lighting can be pretty hit or miss). All 5 of the different island locations are fun to traverse, and have lots to do. For those who have wanted another Sonic game with a cohesive story, you'll be happy to know that this game finally nails it. Sonic Frontier's story answers a lot of lore questions, strengthens character relationships, and gives some well needed characterization to Sonic and his friends. The game's OST is phenomenal, especially some of the Cyberspace tracks. However, on the topic of the Cyberspace stages, they're the one aspect of the game I'm disappointed in. 4 level themes across 40 different stages and reused level layouts make for a pretty disappointing part of the game. On top of that, Sonic controls like GARBAGE in these sections, he's too slow and just feels oddly.... mushy. I'm sure by now there's a physics mod out there that helps fix those issues, but when it comes to the job SEGA did, it could've been much better. As for overall playtime, I finished the story at around 16 hours in; that's about 8 playthroughs of Sonic Forces. I'm working on 100%ing the rest of the game, so that'll probably clock in at around 20-22 hours total.

All in all, Sonic Frontiers is a great step in the right direction, and is definitely worth checking out, regardless if you're a fan of the blue blur or not. Best modern Sonic title we've had in years, and ESPECIALLY blows Sonic Forces out of the water. A solid 8.5/10, hoping to see where we go next!",,
"I'm writing This Review after 100% completion so here's my take of this game
as a long time fan of sonic the hedgehog i didn't care about this game until i got it in a steam sale
the reason being the last outings like sonic forces and lost world not being good games
but this game really took me back to the early 2000's when i grew up with sonic games
this game is a RESET button for the franchise
it takes the characters back to their adventure story arks and gives them growth and development
the story is simple but the way it connects back to the older games and expands the lore is why i love it so much
the graphics are nice but i have a feeling they are limited because of a switch version but not bad overall it gets the job done.
the gameplay was very smooth and fun even rivaling the adventure games
but where this game shines is the soundtrack
its so diverse and unique in the way that it has slow moments like the orchestral themes for the islands and at the same time it has themes like the vocals for the boss fights which i fell in love with the moment i heard these tracks!
the game has some problems of course like the pop in or denuvo slowing down the game some times but its nothing severe that stops you from enjoying this game
the biggest problem with this game was the lack of a satisfying ending which is now resolved in the free update that added a proper ending to the game
as of now sonic frontiers actually became my favorite sonic game even passing the adventure titles
if you haven't played this game or you are new to the sonic franchise i will definitely recommend this game as a starting point because its so good at establishing the characters and the game is fun overall",,
"im sorry but WHAT HAPPENED IN UPDATE 3?
DID SONIC TEAM FORGET WHAT GOOD GAME DESIGN WAS?
HOW IS THE FINAL BOSS WORSE THAN THE ORIGINAL??
WHY DO TAILS AND KNUCKLES CONTROL HORRIBLY??
WHY DID THEY MAKE AN ISLAND THAT FEELS LIKE SOMEONE JUST PLACED BLOCKS EVERYWHERE AND CALL IT A DAY??
3/10 amy feels incredible to play",,
"So at the time of this review, I've barely scratched the surface of this game (got my first chaos emerald, yay!) however, THIS is what we've been waiting for as a shift in 3D sonic games. No silly gimmick like a sword, no Omachao, and actual, freaking combat! For years SEGA couldn't understand how combat could work with a 3D Sonic game, but here, they've finally done it. The game isn't perfect, a little bit of jank here, the voice acting off there, but overall, holy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mushrooms, they've finally released a Sonic game with some class.

EDIT: I have just finished the game and I wanna write this while the feeling is still fresh...

NEVER has a 3D Sonic game made me feel so, fulfilled before. I feel like I just got done watching a really long TV or anime series where I've been there every step during the character's growth and the season finale actually wraps up everything perfectly and all the characters move on to new adventures. This game is the best thing SEGA has produced, and I'm a huge PSU and PSO2 fan.

Please, PLEASE, don't listen to all the nay sayers, they clearly don't know what they're talking about. So what if it's got a 20 hr playtime? It's not about the destination, it's how you got there.",,
"tl;dr version: It's a good Sonic game, but it's just not a good game

The Long Review

Given that this is a Sonic game and how “passionate” the fanbase is, I’m going to issue a triggering warning to any of them before continuing. This is all just my opinion and my perspective on Sonic.

After completing this game 100%, I had some reservations whether to give this a thumbs up or thumbs down. But reluctantly, I gave it a thumbs up even though I feel like the game is only slightly above average.


This is probably the most important thing to talk about in my opinion in this game. Because without good controls, this game is basically dead in the water. Sonic in 3D has not controlled well and has been trash for a very long time. The last good controlling Sonic game was probably Adventure 2. I don’t even give Lost World or Unleashed passing marks. These were very average games that for some reason have been gaining more favorable impressions the more time has passed by from other people. I am not one of those people.

I’m pleased to say that the controls in the is probably the best Sonic has controlled in a long time. You can adjust turn speed, boost speed, and various other things so Sonic controls fluidly in an open space. I was initially worried and skeptical when they announced the Boost mechanic for this game, because I never liked boost to begin with. In previous games, it made Sonic control extremely stiff with no change of direction and you could only move forward and back in one direction.

But in Frontiers, you can actually control quite well in the open zone, and to be perfectly honest, it really is one of the highlights of the game. Moving around in an open space with Sonic is actually pretty fun. And dare I say it, maybe it’s the most fun you can have with player movement in a . Getting top acceleration instantly and traversing through the map extremely quickly is pretty cool and unique for this genre.


Throughout the map, there will be several points of interest for towers. When you interact with them, you’ll be able to transport to another dimension where you’ll play some short levels that are around 1 to 2 minutes long.

There’s two main problems with Cyberspace. For some reason, the controls in these levels are from the open zone. Sonic is back to controlling completely stiff. Very little acceleration. The boost mechanic tries to supplement this, but it hardly ever does. Overall, he just feels extremely slow, stiff and it’s genuinely awful.

When you successfully do a homing attack and kill an enemy, your momentum completely stops and you can’t move forward. When you do a light speed dash on rings, your momentum also stops completely when you get the last ring. Why does your momentum have to stop all the time? When you’re trying to get through the level as fast as possible to get S rank, it just feels like a complete chore if your momentum always stops on certain things. You just have to get used to the bad controls I guess.

There are some well made Cyberspace stages, but unfortunately, I feel like I could count them on one hand and the majority of them were complete trash. Ironically enough, my favorite one is probably 1-2 which you encounter after playing for about 10 minutes. And that may only be because I loved the music in that stage and it was genuinely challenging to S rank.

Overall, it feels like Cyberspace was just some hot garbage that Sonic Team decided to throw into the game at the last minute because they were worried that the fans would get too bored with the open world and needed some “traditional Sonic gameplay”.



I want to state something else that may not be obvious to someone who hasn’t been keeping up with this game, but this is not really a “true” open world game like Breath of the Wild. This is an “open zone” game. Where you have 5 different small maps that you load into via load screens.

The gameplay loop is pretty simple. Go around the open zone. Collect Memory Tokens from various puzzles and rails around the map. Go to the NPC in that zone to turn in your tokens to view cutscenes and progress the story. Collect vault keys from Cyberspace levels to unlock the various Chaos Emeralds. Eventually you can fight the boss in that zone when you progress enough in the story

You repeat this three times for the first three zones. The 4th zone isn’t a real zone. It’s just some filler that they added in that only takes 20 minutes and it just shows you story cutscenes. Then, in the final zone, you do the same gameplay loop one last time and then face the final boss.

I will be honest, it was pretty fun collecting the memory tokens from the first area (Kronos Island) and the second area (Ares Island). But once I got to the third area (Chaos Island), I definitely started to feel fatigue and boredom. Part of that I think is because Chaos Island is horribly designed. A lot of the memory token “puzzles” have you locked into a 2D camera where you’re unable to turn and it feels awful. Another part of it is because of the repetitive nature of the gameplay loop in general.

Sometimes you don’t know how to get to certain memory tokens because the graphical pop-in is so freaking terrible, you can’t see railings and platforms from a distance unless you get closer. This is a major problem with most of the zones, but I found that it was especially bad in the 3rd zone and the 5th zone. Maybe pop-in is acceptable for some underpowered crap like the Switch, but on the PC version, I am sorry, I expect better from them and there should be some higher standards here. This was actually embarrassing that they shipped this into the final product.

There is also a skill tree in this game which I almost completely forgot about. But it is so irrelevant that I don’t even know why they bothered putting this into the game. I basically maxed out my entire skill tree by the time I got halfway through the 2nd map. Huh….? I’m pretty sure they threw this in at the last minute too and had no idea how to balance the experience gain.

There also happens to be combat in this game which I think is pretty cool. There is also a Parry button, but you don’t have to time your parry at all and there isn’t any parry window or anything. You can just hold down the Parry button and it will auto-parry for you. I wish this was changed at least on the Hard difficulty. It kind of felt like a small oversight, but this wasn’t a huge deal breaker for me.

Overall, the combat in this game was passable and didn’t feel like a negative at all. I hope they keep this feature for the next set of games.


Simply put without giving any spoilers, it’s probably the best story that Sonic has had since Adventure 2. And I don’t really give a damn what anyone says. Is it as good as Adventure? No, it’s not. But it is than any of that garbage that came in the past 10-15 years

Yes, I prefer to have a serious story in a game about furry animals. I don’t want some boring slice of life garbage where Sonic doesn’t take anything seriously and nothing matters while he says some Marvel quips

It feels for the first time you actually get to see some small amount of character development from Eggman in particular which was really good


It’s a game that's worth playing if you are a Sonic fan, but is it as good as the original Sega Genesis trilogy, Sonic Mania, Sonic Adventure 1 & 2? No, it doesn’t get to that level. But I would say that it’s going in the right direction. Sega has the foundation here and they just need to keep polishing. Forget about the critics and the haters. Don’t just throw away the idea, and start re-inventing the wheel again for the next game while introducing some crappy garbage like the Werehog. Just stick to this foundation and you might produce something good later on.",,

One of the best Sonic games and still a great game overall,,
"Sonic Frontiers is a love letter to all sonic fans, with what I believe to be one of the best sonic experiences you’ll ever have. With the new final horizon update the game gets an extra 6 hours of content on top of the already healthy length of 15ish hours. I only have one complaint and that is it gets very repetitive by the last island, the formula of an island consists of; Rescue friend, get emerald, play cyberspace to get more emeralds, story stuff, Titan, which can get very repetitive after the 4th time. But if you wish to skip this, the new update adds a while separate ending/story to the game that overhauls the final island to be great. Sonic frontiers is a head bopping good time and is one of my favourite sonic games to date. 9/10",,
"Product received for free

Painfully buggy. Insanely boring gameplay loop of doing the same like 3 things the whole game,bad controls,awful combat,empty boring worlds.
Only decent part was the cyber space levels but that is technically not new content.

Tails is still written as having confidence issues,even though in the adventure era he already gained that confidence.
Should have just skipped to the part where he has it,instead of retreading it again.

"I completed the game and I just have to say that this game far exceeded my expectations, I loved every minute that I played it and I might just jump into a 2nd playthrough, they finally delivered a Sonic game that shows that they still have what it takes to keep the Hedgehog going, the boss fights were so cool, the soundtrack is great as always and the story was very good, I loved the open zones (open world basically) it feels so satisfying to run around a map with Sonic's speed and movement although I am confused why SpinDash is absent in this game while DropDash is here, the Cyberspace levels could use some tweaking control-wise but this game is great in my opinion, I hope SonicTeam builds the next game with what they did right here and improves upon it because I genuinely enjoyed this game easily the best Sonic game in a while, if you like Sonic you will definitely enjoy this!",,
"is this game completetly worth it??? for sonic fans eh....for newcomers i'd say wait till a price drop, since there's nothing to do after you beat the game. a good 6-7/10 for me as a sonic fan imo. there is still some fun to be had (no spoilers)

just felt super repetitive after the 2nd island. and boring at some times as well,
frontiers is SUPER linear in terms of progression for a game that's supposed to be open-world (or zone whatever they call it)
it’s kinda the same thing for every island
wake up there, find one of ur friends, give them memory tokens to free them, do fishing minigame or cyberspace to get keys to get chaos emeralds, get a emerald, talk to a friend, do a quest with a koco, rinse and repeat from there minus the waking up part 😭 like im srry for a “open-zone” this game barley lets u go on ur own path (again there is 0 post content stuff)
so yeah idk the way u progress is pretty lame for me i lost interest after the 2nd island. i still PLAYED through but it got very tiring for me. by the time i got the last island i gave up trying to do the cyber-space lvls to get chaos emeralds, i just went to bigs fishing and did the mini games like 25 times and just traded fish coins for keys for the chaos emerald vaults because i grew tired of everything else.

combat wise, it’s kay….it’s no werehog or heroes, but it’s still pretty fun! i think it’s a bit to automated and most of it is just watching sonic do all the cool stuff. i aboslutely DESPISE the parry in this game. the amount of MGR & devil may cry i played…yeah this parry is straight up not it. why do you have to HOLD IT?? WHERES THE FUN IN THAT?? WHY MAKE THIS GAME EASIER THEN IT ALREADY IS. yes u don’t have to actually time ur parry, u can hold it for literally like 5 mins if u wanted to, and sonic will just. do it. that takes away ALL the fun and stakes from combat. it’s also to easy in general. it’s easy to just pick up rings after being hit and even literally spawn new rings with the cyloop, taking away all challenge, & even you’ll be overpowered by the time u get the the 3rd island where u’ll barley need to even level up at that point bc all enemies will go down in like 4 moves. it feels close to being a literal basic turn based rpg game at this point with u pressing one button or a combination of two and just watching him do a cool move for like 5+ or so seconds and that’s what i find kind of meh about it. it’s fun to pull off combos but we only have like what…12 moves in the entire game? that’s barley the amount of moves you literally start with in unleashed 😭 there’s not alot of variety in moves. and also like i said before. the combat is straight up unresponsive at times, for example, a few moves have u press one of the left&right trigger buttons, when those buttons are ALSO linked to the dodging/boosting, and it’s super difficult to pull off a few certain moves since the game wasn’t tested enough with this in mind. i also feel sometimes the combat is a bit to floaty, it would be cooler if he was more on the ground, also alot of moves are ranged, meaning u can just attack 60% of enemies from a distance without having to get up close & personal. i just wish the combat was more like heroes & unleashed where it was incorporated into ur normal moveset so things felt more responive and natural to use, like how the spindash could be used to take down enemies, but also just give u speed in heroes, or the tornado move used for lowering enemy defense, but also for swinging across poles & stuff, and how the werehog moves could be used to gain extra height & more air time for making platforming more fun and quicker.

the minibosses r pretty fun tho, even if half of them just involve u switching lanes on rails or on a track

the bosses are really fun! if the parry wasn’t horrible, and it didn’t feel so automated at the time i would probably say this was my fav part of the game. dont get me wrong these r rly fun and hype asf i just wish there was more to it.

for platforming…don’t go into this game expecting a rly good platform game. i’ll admit on 1st & 2nd island there are a good solid 4 areas that i really enjoy, they’re all original and feel like cool new levels just waiting to be discovered in the open-zone, this is mostly what i was expecting and if the entire game had more of these i would definitely rank the entire game higher, but since there’s really only really good platforming on only the 1st 3 islands, and barley like 1 in each of those, idk if it’s rlly that good. there are MORE platforming sections, but i think it’s very iffy for me. it’s literally just basic block jumping & running on walls, i dont like having random 2D sections in a OPENWORLD game bc they dont rlly feel as fun and take ur entire movement away, the platforming can be good but only in very small instances in this game

the story tho??? IS rlly rlly AMAZING the dialogue is nice and most of the cutscenes are expressive!!
will admit tho, near the end of the game the story kinda just feels rushed. without spoiling anything it just felt underwhelming and felt like there was supposed to be more 😭

dont get this game on switch, and also play on hard mode, (i played on hard mode) but for some reason, not playing hard mode locks u out of some content, (like the true final boss) and stuff

speaking of the final boss, this is what i meant by lacking, it’s rly rly stupid
without spoiling too much it’s gimmicky and just comes out of nowhere & just…ends.
this game can suddenly get annoying around this part of the game, and a puzzle at the end of the 3rd island WILL test your patience. trust me. be prepared for that

so overall 6-7/10. its fun. but for every good thing i feel there's a bad thing that comes with it. i don't think this was worth the 5 yr wait and def not worth 59.99. get this on sale fs. and don't let me discourgre u from trying the game out, still try it out whenever u can bc u might not agree with everything i said!",,

"This game might as well be the definitive proof that Stockholm Syndrome is real within this fanbase.
To preface my review, if you enjoy the game, that's fine, this isn't meant to remove that from you. Yes the introductory text is a stab at people from the fanbase, reminder that there's people that defend games like '06 and Forces.

At best this game is really mediocre, at worst it's just plain bland and boring.
You give me huge open areas to explore, yet you give me a character that only moves at 2 sets of speeds. One is a painful jog, and the other is ""boosting"", a glorified run button that you can run out of, unless you have full ring cap, yes sonic actually runs out of stamina in this game, a plumber has him beat in cardio. Why would you make really good terrain to actually test out character movement and what could be done with, but you remove all the depth, the little it had coming from forces, and give him the moving abilities straight from Lost World). This has to be a joke, at least you gave me free camera to point the direction for Sonic to move on the Open Zones(You should probably keep it like that everywhere else).

Combat is just not good to engage with, it's overly simplified and just not impactful as it should be, reminder that the same dev studio made Unleashed, that despite being a really weird thing to have done back in '09, that plays and feels alot more fun to dable with, thanks to it being actual phisycal combat and the moves have actual visual impact and feedback to them, rather than being a bunch poorly made animations where the character floats with his foot up in the air and rotating around the enemy.

The Open Zones look really fun to explore, and would be really fun to explore, if it wasn't for the gimped mobility, platforming sections where they take the camera control away from you, Sonic Team really doesn't want you have camera control, floating rails and platforms hanging from nowhere that just screams ""we threw a bunch of our pre-made assest from our other games to fill this empty place with something"" (it's apparently explained as the protagonist hallucinating, good one guys).

The Action(?) Stages, comprised of previously used stage layouts from other Sonic games drops the ball even harder, you can't make this stuff up, the same problem from the bad mobility really shows here, not that you fail the stages or makes them unplayable, it's just that it has very little to enjoy from them, you play them for the necessary amount of times to get all the keys, so you can get the emeralds dotted around the open zones, after that i don't want to touch them again. They're shallow, slow thanks to 2 speed Sonic, the gimmicks are better avoided than interacted, they don't have good music to accompany them, in fact this game's music is something else, but that lies within the realm of subjectivity, but i just don't mix with the direction this one went, try hard metal? really?


Honestly i couldn't bring myself to attempt to even beat the game, it's just way to boring and bland.

I joke about other games (ex: Mirror's Edge) from other devs being better at this type of game than Sonic Team themselves, but this game really feels like ""we don't know what to do, we don't want to make another straight up boost platformer, so let's throw some combat there"", they throw a halfbaked combat system. ""OH but let's also not make it a linear game, so let's do open zones"", that also gets thrown in half-baked, meanwhile something as basic as making the game have good mobility for your 3d platfromer with a character that goes fast and takes advantage of his terrain to go fast, either gets completely forgotten about, or for some really odd reason, is just an after thought, we gotta work on so many aspects of this game that nothing got focused during production, this is just a mashup of ideas thrown at a wall with very little direction being given to any of them.
Meanwhile another studio made a game about parkour and 3d platforming where the whole focus was making first person movement fell really good and fun to play with, and it succeeded at that. And here is a studio that's been making games for the same franchise for decades and somehow despite all the odds, never nails it down, expect for the 3 times it did boost(Unleashed, Colors and Generations), and it did those really well, and they messed it up on Forces, and it felt on purpose.",,
"This is one of the best sonic games in the past years! while not perfect, its still a fun expirence that a recomend!",,
"this game was made EXCLUSIVELY for sonic autists, white people beware...",,
"Overall Verdict: Probably worth full price on console; consider the $40/equivalent range for PC because Denuvo remains one of SEGA's worst decisions.

Sonic Frontiers is overall a pretty decent game, worthy of the 7-8 range. It is plenty clear that a number of Sonic fans wanted a game that they could get lost in for a while, and on that front, it does its job reasonably well. The game has a good deal of leniency and leeway pertaining to the map missions, enemy fights, and overall progression through the game, so the experience isn't particularly grindy. The game's length is in the 15-35 hour range, vastly depending on how much you wish to do within your first playthrough.

The Cyberspace levels are consumed by the rest of the game, making the actual ""Sonic"" portion of the game relatively small by comparison. Therefore, the criticism of how awkward the levels can be remains rather limited, but there are glaring flaws within Cyberspace particularly that do need to be addressed.

Some parts of the ""good/bad/strange"" list will contain some spoilers, so stop reading here if you're concerned.

-----------------------------------------------

The Good:

- Speed Customization. This may be Sonic Frontiers' best thing to bring to the table. How fast Sonic goes, turns, and other detail is now in your hands, to some extent. This could be a very bright move to continue making in future Sonics.
- It first felt a little awkward that Big was randomly in the game, but it certainly isn't the first game where Big had a rather amusing role. Fishing gives you another level of deciding how quickly or slowly you wish to proceed in the game by throwing you certain bones, so to speak, especially when making it to the last island. The fishing mechanic is nothing like Sonic Adventure, for example, but we'll take what we can get here.
- Ignoring games where you can play Super Sonic freely (you cannot here), this is, by a good length, the most Super Sonic action a Sonic game has ever had.
- Tying in to the above bullet, the music is an absolute jam during Titan fights, and a lot of good notes are hit even in the other parts of the game. Overall yet another musical success from a Sonic game.

The Bad:
- Yep. A large portion of Cyberspace levels have the Green Hill skin on them. You'll see exactly three other skins as well: Chemical Plant, Sky Sanctuary, and Generic City (this probably could be seen as Speed Highway). If this game was released earlier, and several games didn't already try to overdo Green Hill's welcome, there wouldn't be as much an issue. But seriously, Sonic has more memories than just Sonic 1/2/3/Adventure 1. Come on. Even under that guise, it's not great falling back on 4 skins for 30 levels. Side note: you will also see past levels in some of these. They aren't trying to hide it.
- People will probably resume complaining about how short the Sonic game is if future levels remain as short as the Cyberspace levels. Sonic's stash of skills is also a little awkward in this game. Stopping as soon as you let go of the stick can be rather jarring. Boost is gimped quite a bit, and in a twist, dash panels become the things you want to take more often. Double jump and drop dash may not be a good combination to have, and I legitimately would rather keep double jump between the two. The air boost will take some time to get used to in terms of aiming, because you get a high arc in this game.
- If you know what this means, you know what I'm referring to.
- They had to put in slots somehow :) but the lights are exceptionally distracting and make it very hard to head to a point you marked on the map. It's effectively wasted time UNLESS you are taking it very slow and need purple coins at the same time.
- It's a strong reason I recommend not getting this version at full price. The game is worth decent money, but Denuvo is never worth a cent. Bad decisions must continue to get punished.

The Strange:
- While I give some credit for the ending trying something different, most people will not expect Additionally, this seems to be the primary incentive of hard mode (not much else felt truly ""hard""). This was a rather odd decision overall.
- The overall story was ok. There was plenty of reflection and such among the characters involved, and the character development setup could be great if it continues the line into future games, but it also felt...short? It's an odd thing to say, but compared to all the things you're doing on the map, the story was relatively bite-sized each time you encountered a new part. All the side stuff felt like a large-scale Q&A session with each character.
- I'm not going to call this a bad decision, just an awkward one. This could have been customized better, either by difficulty, or just starting lower outright. 100 or 200 would have made the initial Super fight(s) more intense. The scale could have also not gone linear, as another incentive to invest in rings over speed (or at least make it an honest decision).
- Again another ""odd"" decision. I guess I can understand offering opportunities to grind skill points outside of small enemies/containers/Cyloop, but tricking off odd parts of the ground is just . This also makes it quite easy to get to Sonic's deep skillset by the end of island 2, which might have been too early for some of his advanced moves. True, you can also just go without skill upgrades the whole way if you wanted, but Sonic's advanced skillset is very powerful, and it might have been better to lock some of the last ones to say, the last island.
- I don't mind this , but it does make Cyloop rather stale after a while. It is still a move I'd like to see in another Sonic game, if possible.
- It feels like the opposite of what should have been done was done here. The signs always gave you something useful on the 1st island, but for whatever reason, many of the signs just give you a dash panel or spring on the other islands, and don't even stay permanent once you do reveal them. This should have been done more on the 1st island, and less/not at all on later islands. The dash panels/etc. revealed aren't even necessary a good portion of the time, either.
- Yeah...the Red Rings weren't implemented well in this game, mostly because the levels didn't even allow for many hiding spots. Not ""bad"" because they still give you a Vault Key per level, but not ""good"" because you can probably still S rank many levels while getting the Red Rings at the same time.
- That particular Titan felt out of place, or at the very least, lacked a gimmick fitting for a 4th boss. The other three were done very well, by comparison. I could also talk about how the last two islands felt not quite right for different reasons, but I don't think that was a particularly bad move on their part.",,

"This game does not disappoint. I did not finished the game, but I can already tell it is a recommended game. The controls are responsive, the fighting is fun and it feels really nice to just run around, not needing to worry as much about this! Oddly enough, no need for momentum! While yes, some of the graphics are not ""OMG IT'S GODLIKE"", like I saw a cutscene or two it was a little bit weird. Some will say that the fighting system is a bit mashy. Though honestly, aside the nitpicking, this is great! Not perfect, far from it! But I can confirm that this is a very neat game. I am happy that SEGA and Sonic Team were able to pull this off and I have fun with this game.

- Update Final Horizon

Final Horizon is a very good update! Play the other characters back after a whole decade was amazing. Wished Amy used her hammer more and Knuckles did not have that delay, but playing them at their full capacity is great. There are multiple puzzles for you to practice with them and I will confirm this: Tails, Knuckles and Amy are all very good. The new cyber stages are quite original too, pretty hard and a reminiscence of Unleash's level to a degree.

Yes, it is very hard at some times, but not impossible. You guys asked for a harder difficulty, and it is! You just gotta practice, know the paths, the physics and see what moves works. Do not just try once and look on the internet. Succeeding at them is worth just for the final boss. All will be worth it.",,
"I've played the game for 30 hours at the time of writing this and I have 100% everything in the game for my first play through and here's my review:

The Game itself is a fantastic experience, The gameplay is fun, The story is fascinating and it expands upon the existing lore for long-time fans and it also hooks in new fans as well, The only problems I encountered in this game are as follows:

one problem is the pop-ins, I don't think it's as bad as ruining the game but it's definitely noticeable, another thing is some bugs here and there that I'm pretty sure will be fixed and if not, they're not that common or game breaking except some that are kinda exploitable. Another thing that in my opinion could improve the game is a bit more balance in the game, fishing, for example, I think it's really good to have the option to buy vault keys and portal gears and etc directly from the fishing shop menu so that some players that are struggling with obtaining them in the normal way get to have them, But towards the end game it really gets OP, for example, I was defense level 40 and power level 45 and speed level 32 before entering the last island, and after one round of fishing in the last island, I was max level on all my stats! (max level is 99 for the 4 RPG stats)
The balancing issue affects boss fights as well, some bosses I was able to halve their HP bar in 5 attacks! (I was playing on hard difficulty and high speed style gameplay for context)

Now back to the good parts of the game, The soundtrack! Oh, the soundtrack! a single word, Awesome! everything about the soundtrack is just pure perfection! I enjoyed every single one of them, And I'm sure most sonic fans and new players are gonna also enjoy them.
This game is a huge step in the right direction for Sonic Team and SEGA and I hope that Sonic Team can expand their team and SEGA gives them more budget to make even better games!

"He's here! and it's been a long time coming. 5 years since we've had a main title sonic game, and I don't need to tell you how that went. Though this game may not be perfect, and there's definitely a few things that could be fixed. It's got actual heart put into it unlike any sonic game in the last decade and a half. Definitely love the game and I hope to see a sequel with improvements to the formula. (Please put a falling animation in next time)

Haters will tell you ""NOO! THE OPEN WORLD LOOKS DUMB ITS JUST RANDOM RAILS!""
Do not listen to them.
Genuinely one of the most fun parts of this game is screwing around on random structures. On the outside it may look dumb, but the random floating ♥♥♥♥ everywhere is a genius design choice. I'm pretty sure I've ran around and climbed the same structure like 10 times now and I'm still entertained by it.
Being based structurepilled aside, the game is really good in general. A bit janky at times but people are just nit picky if that's the only thing they can complain about.",,

"TLDR:
6/10 Overall - Buy the game if you're super into Sonic stuff, otherwise I'd wait for a sale.
8/10 Gameplay/Fighting Mechanics
4/10 Story
7/10 Music

The game is... good.

I really enjoy the mechanics, the open world, and the setting. Music is also great, especially if you like old Sonic style music. The music alone brought back nostalgia of Sonic Adventures 2.

However, there are some problems.
The game feels kind of repetitive, you do the same thing to get to every boss with only a change of scenery and a different color for the stuff you collect. (I'm also not the biggest fan of the missions where you collect the keys, but that's a personal thing, I'm sure most will find them to be fine).

The biggest downside of this game: the story.
I've always loved Sonic stories, even the ones tied to less than good games. They're fun, don't take 'em too seriously, and when I was a kid I thought they were awesome. This one is just.. bland. It also feels like pieces are missing. The whole time I was waiting for them to fill in, thinking ""Oh, they give you a bunch of missing pieces and it all ties together,"" but no. When I finished it, I felt like I was missing crucial plot cutscenes.
The story just didn't have any heart in it.
One last con is it feels like the quality of the boss fights drops significantly with each boss. The first one, 10/10 boss fight. From both a gameplay and cinematic standpoint. The following bosses are just kinda.. meh. And the last Titan is just an absolute bore. I beat it in less than a minute.",,

Absolutely recommend",,
"Absolutely amazing, 9.5/10.

It took a lot of work to get it to run. Hopefully it's patched to run better in the near future. But once I got it running, I was treated to what is definitely in my top 3 3D Sonic games. This is up there with Adventure 1 and 2, two games that I grew up with.

My main issues are a tedious stat upgrade system, where you need to select in a slow menu the same two options almost 200 times just to get two of your stats up to max level, 99 each. There's also very little thought put into the time trials in the ""open zone."" Often, you'll have 90 seconds to complete something that could be done in 10 seconds quite easily.

The pop-in is atrocious but rarely interferes with actual gameplay.

My original review is as follows:

Completely nonfunctional. Does not even start. My attempts to get it to run have resulted in being locked out from authenticating my copy of the game with Denuvo's servers.

A great game, maybe, but if it doesn't even work, how would I know?

My rating for this game is disqualified/10",,
"Definitely one of the best sonic games in a long time. Aside from the rail runner gameplay, the new movement mechanics are a good step in the right direction. I would love to see a new sonic adventure with this kind of movement. The game really peaks when you have your max ring count and are going eleventy billion miles an hour. tis nice.
In terms of story though, so far, its meh. Getting the chaos emeralds is very non gratifying and so is supersonic(atleast the first time). ive just made it to the 2nd island and really hope it improves.
Other than story elements, 9/10. im glad sonic is finally being given a good formula. id like to see them expand on this AND BRING BACK THE CHAO GARDENS! *ahem*",,
"tl;dr: Sonic fans will love it for the crazy amounts of nostalgia and fun gameplay. It's not perfect, but I greatly enjoyed playing this game. It kept me engaged for hours on end.

Pros:
- Open world works so so SO well
- Fun to play, seriously
- Packed with nostalgia from past well-loved titles
- Excellent banter between Sonic and other characters
- SOUNDTRACK!!!!
- Variety of enemies that keep things interesting because you have to figure out how to best them
- Ability to choose easy for focusing on the story, normal for typical gameplay, or hard for a challenge
- Lots of things to do and explore
- There's grinding for types of xp but it's not exhaustive
- Easter eggs all over
- Cyberspace level design is awesome

Cons:
- Control feels wonky at times in cyberspace levels. The best way I can describe it is I wish Sonic's movements felt more precise. It was a little frustrating at times, but not game-breaking for me. I'd love to see Sonic Team improve on this in future titles
- Rails don't have snap points. I wish they kept it Sonic Adventure 2 style
- The game introduces new moves and combos and allows you to practice them, but this could be improved upon by letting you customize which combos to practice in succession
- Boss fights felt very confusing and unbalanced in terms of difficulty...but honestly, that just keeps with the style of fighting normal enemies. It's not just about jump and hit. You need to figure out the strategy for beating them. Once you do that, it's easy to take them down
- The last boss in hard mode, though............ >_>;

Overall, I really enjoyed it and recommend it. 9/10",,
"It definitely brought the Sonic games in a different direction. Lot of similarities between the speed stages for Sonic unleashed up to Sonic forces but you can control it a bit more it's not as frustrating with how fast you go through the stage as much anymore there's still a little bit of glitches with the camera angles from what I've experienced but overall the gameplay was awesome I do think the battle mechanic needs to be balanced because you level up your attack defense speed and ring capacity and while speed and ring capacity don't really have much to do with the overworld the attack and defense do and if you level yourself up too fast you can start blowing through the game pretty easy which is something I did not like so before I beat the game I kept my levels at 50 instead of reaching 99 because if I was level 99 I would have blown pass everything else but being at level 50 the last Island enemies were already hard enough to make the game a bit more enjoyable so if I were to ever play this game again I would just rush through it all without leveling up a single time or at least up to a level where I feel like I could take on things and the game was a bit more challenging for me.

Every single boss fight is really cool the OST in this game is on par with the OST from Sonic adventure 1 and Sonic adventure 2, Sonic heroes and Sonic unleashed. The music in this game went really hard they went really hard on the battle mechanics and gameplay. Also the Lord and story building between Sonic, amy, knuckles, tails and eggman was really cool and it felt like I was reading a Sonic comic from the Archie comics.

It's about as open world as Legends Arceus as you are traveling from Island to Island but you can't travel any further than that they're not all connected so you don't just shift from one place to another like in a full open world game.

I think the way this game was though there's potential to make it even better in a sequel game or just a future Sonic game. You can still play the game you want to play with you can level up how when you want to level up you can choose what bosses you want to fight you can run or walk anywhere you want to go as far as on the island there is multiple side missions and stories multiple stages and the way it works is the story won't progress until you decide to finally start progressing the story.

I'd recommend it to anybody who likes Sonic and might have been turned off by recent Sonic games to give this one a try it's definitely a rebirth for Sonic in the new current age of gaming. I do hope they balance things a bit more but overall if you get a chance to play it and want to try it I highly recommend it.",,

"I've 100%ed the game and,

True Final Boss (Can only be played on Hard Mode) is ass and the ending was not paced well. Cyber Space controls like ♥♥♥♥, has only four level themes, contains level design which was largely ripped from previous Sonic games, and the levels are short & easy as hell. Graphics look average and generally last gen as Sonic Team, in their infinite wisdom decided to build the game for the Switch first and everything else later. Textures are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when observed even remotely closely and the game is generally unsaturated and flat; for this reason it looks far better at night time. A large amount of polish is just not here for a full price game, especially when referring to QOL enhancements that mods will eventually fix; all that being said, for some god-forsaken reason Big's Fishing Mini-game is the most polished part of this game. Animations are an improvement from Forces but are bugged or just not working (Lip-syncing especially) for some optional cut-scenes. Story is genuinely respectable and a ton of effort was put in for the characters to sound like themselves again; If you're a hardcore Sonic fan like I am you will love Ian Flynn for the work he put in for the dialogue. Sage is by far the most interesting villain since Shadow the Hedgehog in Sonic Adventure 2. Open-Zone controls quite well but momentum should've been the main play-style here, and boost should've taken centre-stage for Cyber Space (With Sonic Generations controls & physics). Level design is alright and enjoyable throughout, but you can tell when the team started stressing for time with this game. This game has 5 islands; one of which is separate to stretch out run-time and give the illusion of more content, along with only containing one objective (Which takes 10-20 minutes to complete). The best part about the game are the Titan Boss fights, as they are the best boss fights in a Sonic game. Like the combat as a whole, these bosses are extremely easy and could've benefited from a buff of some kind. The music that plays is incredible, and this goes for the entire soundtrack. It amazes me that this game didn't get nominated for an OST award from The Game Awards. Made sure to nominate it for the Steam Awards though.

STILL, it is a great start and was very enjoyable. I had fun playing the game.

7.5/10

Worth $60 CAD, not $80 CAD imo.",,
"If someone said ""Hey, Sonic Frontiers will be sorta like Sonic, sorta like Nier, sorta like Devil May Cry, sorta like Dragon Ball and sorta like Evangelion"" I'd laugh at your face and say ""sure. I can't wait for them to ♥♥♥♥ up the characters again.""
And then they actually did it right. Bruh.
It's not perfect at all, but... gosh, this game has so much charm going for it, both in the world, characters, atmosphere, soundtrack... it's insane. I feel like I've waited for a Sonic game like this since forever. One that does embrace the franchise as a whole, remembers what Sonic did in previous titles (the Adventure era specially) and just goes with it, even if the story doesn't fully make total sense.
I do think this game needed some quality of life changes (specially on leveling up ring/speed levels,) and maybe Sega (or the fans lmao) will do something about it eventually.
Overall, I'm glad to see Sonic getting a good game again. And I hope they keep it going like this for the next one.",,

"Before i say anything, ♥♥♥♥ THE PINBALL MINI GAME Section 100%!

I literally stopped the cut-scene to leave this review, might edit after i finish the game but... that was just so bad!
Mindless mashing the shoulder buttons till i got the score of HALF A MILLION. It's not hard, just very insulting at this point in the game.

Whoever was in charge making that, bad, bad programmer! That was the worst pinball mechanics ever! All you had to do was actually PLAY sonic SPINBALL and you would have known how to actually make Sonic in a pinball setting...

with that out of the way, as a Sonic Fan since 1991.. this game IS worth your time hands down but as with every sonic game, it has its quarks to which some fans have solved with mods. Main quark being CyberSpace doesnt feel 1 to 1 with how Sonic feels in Open Zone. Stiffened up for those levels.

Story isn't anything to write home about, typical eggman shenanigans but with a twist of him being trapped as we are or so we think.

Gameplay; aside from said quarks feels really great in Open zone, a much more solid attempt than any other entry thus far, Combat for sonic always was hit or miss but this has a good flow, you have quite a bit of settings to mess with to make Sonic feel like how you wanna control him.

Do you want a slightly slower paced adventure? go for it!
You want blazing speeds and turning on a dime? Its there for you to adjust!

His default speeds can be tweaked to your liking which allows for accessibility for those who dont wanna exactly be a blur.

Solid game 8.5/10 for sure, coulda took more feedback on level designs or activities done in open zone.",,
"Best Sonic game in years.

There are a lot of ways to progress, whether that's interacting with the enemies and structures in the overworld, completing cyberspace stages or just buying everything through fishing. The fishing is a lot of fun, has can catch and is pretty simple to master. If you're not satisfied with how Sonic controls, you can adjust it in the options menu - a welcome addition given the many debates the fanbase has had about controls in the past.
There are mini-games throughout the story that shake up the gameplay ALA Sonic Adventure.
The new writing and voice direction for this game was a much needed change, Sonic no longer comes off as annoying and Eggman's chill side is very interesting to see. Sage is a great character too.

There are downsides - You can get caught by a dash panel and thrust into a direction you don't want to go while trying to go somewhere else. Some challenges require nighttime and can be annoying to wait for if you want to do said challenge specifically. The Max Ring level is useless: The default (400) is more than enough and you get a speed bonus when you hit the cap, so all this level does is make getting that take longer. Object pop-in is noticeable, you can see it happening at close range. One part is exclusive to Hard Difficulty and leaves the others feeling underwhelming as it is skipped without any indication.

Frontiers has its flaws, but so did past successful Sonic games. That didn't stop them and it's not stopping this one.",,
"A contender for one of the best Sonic games.
I loved playing through this and 100%ing the game all the way to the very end.
I even had fun with the cyberspace stages despite how stiff the controls are.

The movement is solid and fun, just wish the game was a bit more polished. Certain animations still look unfinished. Overall this game is really good and definitely one of my favorite Sonic games to date.",,
"Shoutouts to Nintendo for invented mountains and trees in an open world sandbox game. But in all seriousness, Sonic Frontiers is a great game with a couple issues. The minigames you have to do and the 3rd island were particular sour points. But besides those parts, I really enjoyed everything else about the game, the Cyberspace levels was really fun to go through in particular. More of these levels (and more importantly, with original level designs) in the next game, please. It's probably now one of my favourite Sonic games alongside games like Sonic 3 & Knuckles and Sonic Adventure. Very much recommended",,
"I quite enjoyed the game for the most part, but found the movement to be strange feeling and probably one of the worst feeling movements we have had for Sonic in the entire boost generation set. On top of that, not a single one of the upgrades from the Open World side fail to transfer over to the Cyberspace stages which make them feel very bad at the same time.

At the same time, the game overall is fine with the exception of the final dlc which is... just bad. Its straight up bad. Maybe I'll change my rating in the future if the DLC actually improves, but this sits in the not recommended catagory until then.",,
"Edit: Even though these drawbacks can be excessive ones for some people, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME. The soundtrack is PHENOMENAL like it always is with sonic games, there are PLENTIFUL amounts of call backs (Especially to SA2, which I adore), good jokes and moments, amazing boss fights, and has AMAZING gameplay. Sonic team published a BANGER sonic game this time around! Anyways, back to the (minor) drawbacks of my original review.

(Mostly) Original review:

Fun game, nice concept, but definitely designed with consoles in mind. If you like sonic, why not buy the game, it's fun but there are some drawbacks.

- Mouse input acts as if it's a joystick, not sure if there's an option to change that but my controller died and I struggled to figure out that 'P' pauses the game instead of escape.
- Pop-in during some cutscenes shows that this was designed for consoles, mainly the Switch
- You get 30 FPS or 60 FPS. No more. There'll be a mod or update for that soon enough.
- SOME cutscenes look like they don't have anti-aliasing, which is odd. Game looks better than cutscenes somehow.

Even though these drawbacks are quite minor, it is still something to note. These will all be fixed either by Sega themselves OR by the (inevitable) modding community. I already have 11.5+ hours in the game. I love it, buy it.

Sega/Sonic team- thank you for making a fun game!",,

"my thoughts about sonic frontiers since I completed it recently, honestly one of my favourite modern sonic game its a big step towards the right direction, the gameplay isn’t perfect and the movement can be little janky at time but compare to forces is a huge improvement, The story is also great and immersive and the fact that they moved into a more open world rpg type of game i love it, had so much fun playing it and i wish I could erase the memory of me playing it just to play it again",,
"As a person who doesn't play many Sonic games due to their mixed reception, I was wonderfully surprised with how much fun I was having with this game! The movement in particular is exactly what I could have wanted out of a Sonic game, it's fast paced and lends itself to creativity with how you traverse the world. The only thing I'd warn new players of is the control settings, you'll be pressing the right trigger on your controller a lot and your hand will strain very easily, rebind boost at your leisure!",,
"This game is #$^ing cool.

Open world Sonic fused with some Dragon Ball Z / Tron (At least visually).

It does all the high-speed rail stuff we love, but at the same time gives you giant hub worlds filled with collectables.

I felt like a kid in a candy store, wanting to pick everything up, it really satisfied both my Sonic itch and my 3D platformer collect-a-thon itch at the same time.

My first couple of hours I wasn't sure what to make of it, but it opened up and got more interesting. There are some frustrating moments as you adjust to the many controls. The game is aware of this, and on loading screens it lets you practice and familiarise yourself with moves. One gripe is that graphics look better in the screenshots than in-game. Things just don't.. 'pop' as much in the game.

There's collectables and wild rides in every direction. Often I set out to do something and get distracted by everything else around me and I end up having done 5 other things, but not the thing i set out to do originally, just because i got tempted to step on that speed pad on my way to my original destination.

While the game does allow you to do combo-combat, you can literally just mash the attack button and have combo's fire automatically (It's this way by default). I was happy enough with this. There will be plenty of people that don't want to do Dragon Ball Z combat in their sonic game, and i think they made an excellent choice to make this on by default. What it amounts to is regular 3D platformer combat, but with flashy fun Dragon Ball Z animations frequently firing while you're doing it. Easy, but satisfying.

You will get an occasional death from the camera locking/unlocking in platforming segments. I think any complaints about this are both justified but also understandable because of how the game likes to switch you from 2D to 3D. While the transitions aren't always ideal, I still feel the game is much better as a result of having these things mixed, even if it means bumping into the occasional jank.

This game was a blast, it blew me away. If you enjoy the collect-a-thon variant of platforming games, well this modern take is brilliant and pretty much mandatory in my opinion. There's plenty of rough spots here and there, it's not a perfect diamond, but it is just so much fun to play if you like collect-a-thons.

"Pretty good game even with the bugs and graphical issues, I give it a 8 out of 10.

What I liked:
Sega made a new story and a new universe of enemies and worlds for you to explore which was nice. I really liked the designs of the enemies and the optional discussions with the characters throughout the game. The Koko were cute and worked for collectibles towards upgrades. The music kicked ass, which is usually a guarantee for all Sonic games. Amy is in the game so that's an automatic +5 points. You can go fishing with Big, and it's really easy and helpful as you can get useful items like tokens and keys. You can also catch Vector's distant relatives and poison dart frogs.
The controls can be a little wonky at times (especially during the cyberspace levels), the boost during those levels doesn't feel super strong unless you jump then boost to fly further. Sonic is really light in the air and a lack of his shadows/ poor angles causes difficulty in telling how far something is in front of you, which caused most of my retries. Sometimes when you're following boost pads and springs, you can just get shot too far, falling off the level.",,
"One of the best experiences I've had the pleasure of playing.
The music is amazing, especially the boss battle music. the bosses themselves are on par if not better than Metal Gear Rising. Kick ass music wile you absolutely demolish colossal enemies makes you feel sick as hell.

The game is a little flawed. Mid-air speed is nonexistent, some of the puzzles are tedious, and a few of the Cyberspace missions might want to make you want to taste some buckshot. I did also have a few performance issues on Ares Island especially but that's also because my computer isn't exactly built to run the graphics. that being said with my dog ass computer the game ran SUPER well all things considered.

Amazing game, buy it for a wonderful experience!",,
"This wasn't a game, it was an experience. The beauty, majestic, and serenity of this game was my stress reliever. I felt immersed in this game and what it had to offer. Most of all, I personally think the soundtrack of this game does it justice. Its outstanding and the icing of the entire game.",,
"This game as a long time Sonic fan was a breath of fresh air, it certainly isn't perfect by any means but it's what I wanted when I bought this game. It's what I imagined when I heard the words open world (zone) Sonic game.",,
"TL;DR: It's good. Not quite the Sonic Renaissance people were claiming it to be on launch, but I think its a solid step in a good direction, and I hope Sonic Team can take criticisms of Frontiers and iterate on it to create something we've been craving for years. I recommend to wait for a sale to pick it up, as I feel that all but the truest of Sonic fans will feel slightly burned on the price.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Having been diagnosed with a terminal case of ""being a Sonic fan"" in my early childhood, these past years have been quite tough to weather. It's hard to watch as a franchise you've loved since the beginning continues to have their missteps turn into full blown car crashes, all while feeling that if the developers just to their (very) passionate fan base, maybe they could claw back some of the series' dignity.

Sonic Frontiers feels like they are starting to listen again.

NOTE: To add context to this review, I have 100% completed Sonic Frontiers over the course of around 40ish hours.

The game is divided into two main parts. You have the open-world areas which are focused on exploration and exposition, taking the form of five large islands filled with rings, enemies, collectibles, and challenges to complete. Then you have Cyberspace, which are your 3D platforming levels like you would expect to find in a more linear Sonic title. Each Cyberspace level has challenges to complete within it, awarding a rank based on performance upon completion.

The writing is certainly a breath of fresh air compared to previous titles. Bringing in Ian Flynn was one of the best decisions they made for this game, and I hope Sega and Sonic Team choose to keep him around. Around the late 2000s and early 2010s was when Sonic started to adopt a more childlike and immature style of humor that did not jive well with most, myself included. Frontiers dials it back to a more tolerable level, about even with 90s Sonic. He's got an actual personality now instead of being a walking joke/quip/sarcasm dispenser, and I really hope we get to see some more actual character development for him in-game in future titles. The supporting cast is great as well. It's hard to explain, but this is the first time in recent memory where Sonic and his buddies have actually felt like they hang out on a regular basis, rather than just meeting up once a year to stop Eggman's evil schemes. As far as the main story goes, to keep this review spoiler-free, it's okay. Nothing ground breaking. Sonic needs to figure out how to get him and his friends off these mysterious islands, which naturally leads to him needing to save the world along the way. The real interesting bits are the side-conversations between characters. Frontiers seems like its trying to fix one of the major issues with the Sonic series, which is how disconnected it all feels. Every one to three games seems like they take place within an entirely different universe. This is the first time in my memory that characters have made direct reference to events and characters from previous games, seemingly trying to tie everything together moving forward.

The gameplay is decent. I get the feeling that Sonic Team was unsure which part of the game they wanted to throw more of their developer weight behind, leading to both the open-world and Cyberspace areas feeling lacking in at least a few ways.

The open-world areas can be fun to blitz through at high speeds, but lack a significant amount of variety and begin to look very samey after a few hours. The open-world also suffers from truly abhorrent draw distance and pop in issues. Many of the activities on the islands involve platforming between seemingly randomly placed springs, zip lines, boost pads, and grind rails. You will encounter many times where you simply cannot see the next step in a sequence, leading to you falling down and needing to retry. You'll also have times where you see what appears to be a conveniently placed boost pad or spring you'll want to use as it appears to get you to where you want to go, only to find your camera is suddenly locked to a 2D perspective, and that you are unable to leave the platforming section you've entered without completing it or falling off in a certain direction. Combined with a half-baked combat system that throws so many unnecessary moves and combos at you in the first hour you'd think you were suddenly playing a fighting game, and we are left with a truly bizarre experience.

The Cyberspace sections are where the game truly begins to crack under its own weight. You would imagine that being Sonic's first real foray into an open-world experience, the more linear sections would be strong enough to hold the game up if they struggled. Unfortunately, these levels were not able to be given the time and love they needed to truly blossom. Another common criticism of Sonic games is their over reliance on past successes, most often taking the form of Green Hill Zone or a variant being the first level of the game. Sonic Frontiers takes this to a new height by making 1/4th of the game's 30 Cyberspace sections themed after Green Hill Zone. There are four themes in total for the Cyberspace levels, including other fan ""favorites"" like Chemical Plant, Sky Sanctuary, and ""Eternal Highway"", which is just an amalgamation of city-themed levels in previous titles. Most of the Cyberspace levels contain recycled geometry from previous games as well, though this is much less of an issue in my personal opinion. There is a story reason as to why the levels look like this, but I do not feel like it justifies it from a gameplay perspective. Additionally, the controls within these levels vary wildly, seemingly from level to level. Compared to a game like Sonic Adventure, where you had fairly full control, Sonic Frontiers gives Sonic so much inertia in movement and jumps, but still somehow made him feel very floaty. It feels like physics from Sonic Generations with Sonic's weight cranked up a handful of notches.

Despite all this, I maintain the opinion that Sonic Frontiers is a good game at the end of the day. It does indeed have its flaws, and some people may consider the game not worth your time because of them. I recommend you give it a try, though maybe wait for it to be discounted first if you aren't the kind of person who regularly plays Sonic games, and don't have exploitable feelings of nostalgia to help you look past some of the more glaring flaws on display here. Give it a shot. You'll know whether you'll enjoy the full game or not well within the refund window.",,
"Great game for Sonic fans!!! If you love the Sonic characters and their stories, I think you'll love this game. They give them so much fun dialogue to really let their personalities shine in ways we haven't seen in the Sonic games for a while now. So many fun and cool references to past games and shows and comics. A great comeback for Sonic and a fun/chill play. Just run around, listen to pretty music, and vibe!",,

Eh, not gonna cry about it, nonetheless a really awesome game.",,
"This is a really fun game! Took a second to get into the groove of things, but once I did there was no stopping! Can't wait for the updates!",,
"I have not played a whole lot yet but I can tell you that this is one of the best 3D Sonic games since the Dreamcast days. Other one were ok but nothing tops this, Generations was close.

First off the open world there are puzzles and many things to collect. I find myself asking ""How do I get that?"" As I find a rail or a bounce pad that allows me to reach greater heights. Exploration is key, it's high paced and fun grinding rails.

The variety of enemies and how to take each one down was surprising to me. I just got to the 2nd of 5 islands and AI found myself with probably 1 enemy that is the same type from the 1st island, however I have to use different methods of taking them down. Other enemies are new to the island.

The mini bosses are fun and unique, I'll tell you I never expected to hold on to a shark's tail and basically ski in the middle of the desert. The enemies and mini bosses drop loot like gears which unlock stages, keys to unlock vaults, and items used to upgrade Sonic's skills.

The world itself beautiful, the music is atmospheric and amazing.

Pick up the game if you love Sonic you won't be disappointed.


**Update**
After playing more, now on the 4th island. There are some frustrations, but that's there are always bound to be those. The camera can be a little painful, especially when you get into the force 2D perspective when activating boost pads or rails. I have had an event happen twice to me right after I killed a mini boss, and I lost the item it dropped, not a problem, but it was a little annoying.

The boss fights are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun, if you wanted Super Sonic, well this game has him probably the most out of all the other 3D Sonic games. Rather than saving him for the final boss you get to have fun with him.

Stay tuned for more...",,

Love it so fare but the following items would make it GREAT on PC:

1. Increase the draw distance
2. uncap the FPS we should be pushing 90+ FPS on this
3. ULTRAWIDE SUPPORT DAMNIT.

"While the game has it's flaws, it's honestly a pretty zen experience exploring the islands for things, and the cyber space levels are both good for bite-sized speedruns and are just fun trying to spot what level design it's calling back to. Also the characterization is great and while the lore callbacks are sometimes a bit egregious, it's really fulfilling to see all these events a lot of sonic fans have played through be treated as relevant information that the characters remember and compare against.

It's probably a bit mid if you're not a sonic fan but if you do enjoy sonic or the characters then this will likely be a surprising treat.",,
"(non spoiler review)
Okay after beating this game with more than 20h of playtime i can say Sonic Frontiers is up there as one of the best 3d sonic games of all time.

Gameplay: The gameplay loop is surprisingly solid and fun to play, the combat and combo systems are really fun and easy to pull, making the game really enjoyable. Yeah the physics can be jank sometimes on Cyberspace levels, but fun jank nonetheless. Also fishing minigame ftw :)
World building: The starfall islands, while they may look like the ultra generic realistic field, it has its own identity with the ruins and stuff it has. The Cyberspace stages, in the other hand, kind of fall flat, with only 4 level themes to go with and (mostly) reused layouts of other sonic games, mixed with sonic's ultra junk physics on cyberspace levels make these not that enjoyable, but decent enough to not be a highly negative point.
Enemies and Bosses: The generic enemies can get a bit repetitive sometimes, but you dont really need to fight them ALL the time so its okay. Mini bosses(guardians) can be a hit or a miss, because for every Ghost or Spider, there are Fortress and Caterpillar. They are mostly solid, but not for everyone's cup of tea to be honest. Now about the true bosses on the game(Titans), they are truly bangers BANGERS. An epic boss theme, battles that will keep you focused all the time and Super Sonic, what else could you be asking for? The final boss is... yeah. I wont spoil it. I wish there was some kind of way to replay bosses though.
Story: The story is pretty good on the most part, what all sonic fans have been waiting for years: a story that actually takes itself seriously. It kinda falls near the end, when it gets rushed, but it still manages to end on a sweet note.
Music: Boy oh boy, that variety, that quality, those bangers, what can i say? This sonic game might have one of the most diverse and best soundtracks of the whole franchise. There's something for everyone, from hard metal to relaxed Lo-Fi vibes.

Summary: This game may not be perfect, but is a huuuuuuge step into the direction Sonic games should be taking on the future. If you want a taste of that future, highly recommended.
Score: 8/10

"I don't get why so many Youtubers are hating on this game. This is one of the best Sonic games released in the past 10 years. The soundtrack is great, especially during the boss fights.

"THIS IS A LOOOOOONG REVIEW. I HAVE LISTED THE GAME'S PROS AND CONS AND GIVEN AN OBJEXTIVE SCORE BELOW FOR ANYONE SKIPPING THE SENTIMENTAL HOOBLAH.

I still remember the very first game that got me into the world of gaming. I had played exactly 2 games before that game. Transformers: the game and the TMNT 2007 Game. I played those two when i was about 8 purely because of my love for the movies. Then, one day when i was out with a buddy, they kept telling me that they need to buy a game called Sonic Heroes. When we got to a DVD store, he practically forced me to buy and experience a Sonic game for myself. And i ended up with SADX. SADX made me love Sonic. I then HAD to play Sonic Heroes. Next, I HAD to play Sonic Riders. Then i HAD to get a PS2 so i could play Zero Gravity. Before i knew it, i had not only grown to love Sonic, but gaming in general.

14 years later, I just played Sonic Frontiers. I am the biggest fan of Sonic, but i won't defend a game blindly. Forces was awful and i literally forgot about what even happens in it weeks after i finished it. Lost World was a painful attempt to enjoy but a failure to do so ultimately because of the horrible controls. Generations was my top pick for a long time, mainly because i always enjoyed the boost gameplay. Against all odds though, i had never played SA2, and i recently picked it up and played the hell out of it. I loved it. I became a fan of both Boost and SA style of Sonic. Then the classics. I never grew up with them, and always found it difficult to like them. I even enjoyed the 2.5D sections of modern games much less than the rest. But i kept playing Mania, and then realised that the game isnt about dashing through the fastest route on the first try, but enjoying the game as a platformer which you then learn the routes to make a mad dash for the goal. I now love classic Sonic too.

Coming into Frontiers, my expectations were a roller coaster. I was extremely hyped, but was apprehensive of it given the track record as of late. Preordered it nonetheless. Saw the reviews and got dissapointed. But went into it excited as ever. What awaited me was the one of the greatest experiences i have ever had with a game. There were moments in the game which i just couldn't even comprehend were real. It's very rare that a modern game manages to capture the magic of what makes gaming so surreal and takes you right back to your childhood. This one, fortunately, absolutely succeeds.

It's not a perfect game. Flaws Include:
- Immovable camera during certain boss segments (it shows the indicator, so it's not a technical issue, it was designed that way)
- running on the green glowing walls is not always accurate, and can send Sonic flying
- dip in effort for the last island and final bosses and rapid pacing of story after 3rd island
- clunky menus (ironically the menu to enhance Sonic's speed is the slowest one)
- a bizarre boss fight near the end
- very few puzzles. Especially the puzzle leading to the first boss.
- Pop in. Noticeable, but does not affect gameplay. Did not bother me, but might bother others.

Potential con/pro
-/+ open world activities and puzzles (depends on whether you enjoy the open world activities and unlocking the map then moving on to the next one and so on. I absolutely loved it, and those giving positive reviews seems to have too. For those people, this is a surreal experience. For those that dont, it will get repetitive and annoying)
-/+ Cyberspace levels. These are weirder this time around with a lot of variety. Mileage will vary
-/+ Voice acting. Was jarring for me at first, but later was loving it because it feels on point with the more serious tone of the story. Feels like the characters have matured. Amy is my personal fav, she is an incredible character in this game and each interaction with Sonic and the rest of the gang is a joy.
-/+ graphics. textures are not the best, but lighting is beautiful. Really gives the look of an abandoned island once populated by an ancient civilisation
-/+ Barren lands. Again, this one is down to personal opinion. I think it works perfectly with the story. It does not make sense to have NPCs because these are abandoned islands. There are coco, enemies and main story characters everywhere, which do a pretty good job of filling things up. Other than that, i think that the feel and ambience of the islands are exactly how they should be. Besides, it does not pose to be noticeable when you are zipping around.

Pros:
+ Soundtrack. Worth price of admission for this alone. Experiencing a boss unspoilt is the greatest gift anyone could ever give you. Every song with vocals somehow captures what is going through the mind of Sonic as a character in the game, Sonic as a gaming franchise, Sonic Team or any other character in that situation. We don't deserve this.
+ Stunning meshing of all mechanics in every Sonic game prior to this. Classic gameplay? you got it. Adventure gameplay? you got it. Boost gameplay? you got it. Warehog combos that don't suck? you absolutely got it with a pinch of DMC. Lost world style platforming that doesnt suck? you got it. 2.5D? you got it. Fishing that is actually fun, relaxing and rewarding? you got it. Riding a board? It's just one level, but that is technically a yes.
+ Clear mechanics. The game clearly establishes the mechanics that are available to the player, and these stick throughout bosses as well. If you have an ability, you can use it. The game also has a nice tutorial section that pops up near any encounter which let's you know what abilities can/need to be used. It is not forced, rather a button prompt - very handy. The loading screens also incorporate the tutorials, again a nice touch. There is only a single occurance of an unestablished mechanic popping up at the very end of the game in the form of a new type of QTE.
+ Controls are an absolute joy, and this is the best modern Sonic has controlled
+ Camera. They have put so much effort to making the camera great. I encountered very little problems with the camera. It is snappy and keeps up. Considering the speed of movement, it will always be difficult to have a perfect camera in an open environment for Sonic, as proven by some of the shortcomings of the adventure games. This is an extremely commendable job. They also have a static camera for segments of platforming, and this fixes into place very nicely and there is an indicator to let the player know when they cannot move the camera manually.
+ Story and interactions. Absolutely amazing and surprisingly intimate story/interactions. A very memorable story on par with SA2.
+ Moment to moment gameplay loop. With established mechanics and a great combo system, this is a joy to play.
+ Atmosphere and ambience.
+ Enemy designs. Some of the best i have seen in a Sonic game. It surprised me how they have managed to incorporate even some of the platforming mechanics into defeating specific enemies.
+ Future DLC. Some free DLC has already dropped for the game. There is more planned along the way, which will also be free from what has been announced.

This game is not perfect in the sense that not everyone will enjoy what it has to offer. That is where the reviews come in. But if you are lucky, like me, you will get one of the best experiences of your life with this game. This was literally everything i wanted in a Sonic game. The embodiment of what Sonic is and always has been - fighting through the odds and always coming out on top. That has been true for his character in a given game and as a literal real life franchise. This game contains so many references and throwbacks to real life failures as well, it is just unreal. This is an underdog story, and i am here for it.

Objectively, this game is a 7.5/10 considering everyone's perspective and the enjoyment they will get. But experience wise for those this was made for, absolute 11/10. Welcome back, Sonic!",,
"It has his ups and downs but ouverall it's a great game, the downs are a minority in the wole experience of the game.
I really loved this game it has been a long time since i played a fun sonic game, the story is not the best but is a good one, for me the best part of the game is the super sonic boss battles except the last one whitch was very disapointing, the cyberspace levels are fun but a bit repetitive and it's cool to see sonic beat down some weird robots, the combat is also fun btw.
in other words... THE GAME IS GOOD AND FUN GO PLAY IT NOW!!!

I won't say this is the best sonic game but this one is gonna be in my top 5 with it's fun action game play and story line and very interesting boss fights oh and the fishing (way better than sonic adventure fishing am I right.,,
"Finally a good sonic game! 7/10

hey, thats basically a 10/10 for sonic fans xD",,
The game left me wanting more. Wish there was a Koco Garden for replay ability.,,
SONIC IS BACK,,
"Overall Great Game, here the specifics:
Pros:
-This entry has the best character dialogues in the entire series. Their interactions and character evolution has never been this great! Most of them might not be as important as you might think, but you en up rooting for them while they push the story forward. All of them feel VERY alive.
-Story remained very interesting to the very end.
-The game looks, for the most part, great. You can freely reduce the resulution if your PC can't handle it. I used a 1050 for this.
-Music also has been great, even if not perfectly alingned with my tastes. They fit perfectly.
-The new mechanics, zones and themes have brought an excellent gameplay loop. So great in fact that I often found myself doing free optional tasks around the world without any rush to progress the story.
-Boss battles, even if not that hard, have been exillerating all the way through. They pumped me up and never before made me feel this powerful and epic.
-Great Free DLC with lots of content, llike new characters, skills and challanges!
-THe DLC difficulty levels are great if you want a challange.

Cons:
-Cyberspace, where they resuse past gameplay design and stages, feel off. I don't think Sonic's movement was designed for this. Also, I'ts ovious they have the same layout design, but also because they use a lot of alredy seen themes that honestly burned me.
-If you don't select the HARD difficulty, you will skip the end boss without any notification. I discovered it after finishing the game (Note that the final boss is no reward for your efford, you can change difficulty anytime and the plot remains the same). (The DLC final boss is more what we were looking for though).
-Even though it was no issue for me, must admit there is a pop-in problem in the enviorment. Might get you out of the immersion.


Glad Sonic made a comeback with this!

Edit 2024: Removed half of the ""Cons"" couse they fixed them! horray!",,
"Now that the game is complete, i can give it my full unbiased review.
This is by far the most ambitious and lengthiest sonic game to date. Not only did the last 3 updates give it more content, but a whole new ending which solidified Super Sonic as the coolest character to exist since SA2. (sorry shadow)

Pros:

✰The best controls the franchies has recieved since its transition to 3D
✰An engaging and serious plot unlike the previous goofy nonchalant stories that's been kids oriented ever since Colors. (Thanks Ian Flynn very cool)
✰Finally, character Developments after a whole decade.
✰Music: No comment, my mountain pile of wet pants speaks for itself. (Fun Fact: Stillness & Motion album is proven to increase testosterone by 100%. My Source is go listen to it bro)
✰Scale wise, the game is massive, and update 3 is the icing on the cake which provides it with:
-More content
-A REAL hard mode
-more content
-Super Sonic 2
-Challenges that require skill. You heard it, SKILL.
-more content
-Playable Tails, knuckles and amy, which haven't been playable since Sonic '06. (That's 17 years)
-more content
-A true ending with an EPIC final boss
-Did i mention More content?
✰Last but not least, Sonic is cool again.

Cons:

✰Sonic Forces model.
✰Some cyber space levels being clunky, short, or just boring
✰Kronos and Rhea island are in 2 seperate maps
✰camera can go brrr during big bosses
✰Spin dash being a late game unlockable
✰Sonic's skill tree is way too small, and you can unlock everything pre 2nd island
✰Momentum could use some work
✰No free roam as super sonic

All in all, SEGA cooked well. Looking forward to Frontiers 2.

"Best main Sonic game in YEARS it does have some jank and that can either be something you really like because of the game shenanigans or hate it with your soul, the open world feels great and theres a lot of platforming to do, on the other hand the cyberspace levels are not the best some of them are GREAT but they do feel A LOT diffrent from the open world and can mess with you
Overall a good sonic game",,
"Sonic's first attempt to pull of a more open area form of structure and how does it fare?
Surprisingly decent, but still clearly showing that it was their first time doing this with Sonic.
Saying that it's the best Sonic game in a decade doesn't really say much, but that's what it is.
You're gonna spend a vast majority of your time in the open zones, exploring every nook and cranny while collecting everything from memory tokens to strength and defense seeds to upgrade your stats. Combat is an interesting part of the game while it's obviously not as fleshed out as other character action games, it's still fun where enemies vary in how you take them down. The cyberspace levels can get kind of repetitive since not do you only have 4 themes spread out over 30 cyberspace levels, they also use level layouts from older games. Story is for once actually pretty decent and I truly hope that we'll get a sequel because I wanna see what happens next. Soundtrack is absolutely fantastic too",,
"Sonics first step out of his grave I really hope it wil continue to go upwards again, this game still has a bunch of things that could be improved but I imagine that this is sega's fault and not TS' since they cut the funds as far as I understand because it took to long",,

"Sonic Frontiers is a game that i have been anticipating for the entire year. When it was first presented from IGN, it looked pretty empty and soulless, so i got very skeptical about it. Also especially considering how the previous major game went (Sonic Forces).

However as time went on, more content was revealed. And this game started looking very promising.

Fast-forward to the present, i have got my own hands on this game at the day 1, and already finished it.
And i have to say that this game has actually pleasantly surprised me. Since i had such low expectations.


The gameplay is fun, there is always stuff to do. You can either
explore the island, fight enemies, do random platforming stuff, and if you want to take a break from all of that, there is a great fishing minigame with the one and only; BIG THE CAT. (Also a nice lo-fi music plays in the background)


The story is finally good. Or decent if worst. You can see the huge difference in writing when you compare Frontiers and Forces. I really hope SEGA keeps Ian Flynn in the writing team.


The most hyped part of this game are without any doubt the Titan boss fights. SEGA finally decided to use the full potential of Super Sonic, and the music playing in the background is metal af

What did kinda disappoint me though was the final boss.


Now we get into the spoiler territory, so keep that in mind.





Bugs.
There are also a lot of bugs and glitches in the game. At the time of writing this, the game hasn't been patched up yet. So a lot of pop-ins and overall jank is still there. But it didn't really ruin my game play at all. It's in a much better state than Sonic 06, so that's a compliment lol.

And the last part, the music.
Oh my god the music is so good in this game. Probably one of the best videogame OSTs of all time imo.


Alright! So to sum it up, i think Sonic Frontiers is a very good game with high potential for the series.
It's not the most perfect game, but it's on a very high ranking for me.
I had a great time playing this game, and i'm looking forward to play more of it when i feel like it!

Oh yeah. Rating? 8/10

UPDATE:

So, many things have happened after writing this review back in Nov. 2022.
Three content updates have been released. The updates added a ton of new stuff, both gameplay-wise and story-wise. I liked the new challenges and collectibles that have been added in the first two updates, since they made this game a lot more replayable.

And of course, the main focus is on the third update, which added a brand new ending to this story. When i played this update, it was not patched yet. The challenges were very hard, even to me as a skilled player of this game. I can't imagine how hard it must have been for casual players. But on the bright side: The three new playable characters were very great to play as, however i wish it would be possible to disable the Glitch effect they had on for the whole game.

Spoilers ahead:



So, to top it all of, with all the new updates, despite few smaller issues this game still has (like pop-in for example, that hasn't been fixed for some reason), this game became my favorite 3D Sonic game of all time. I do not even exaggerate it when i say that.

So yeah, that is that. If you're a Sonic fan, having this game is a must.
If you are new to Sonic series, i am sure you won't get bored with this game, and it is a good introduction to the whole series :).

"Awesome game. The most fun I had in a 3D Sonic in such a long time. There are some glaring issues, but it personally has not detracted my enjoyment of the game.

Very fun and probably one of my favorite Sonic games of all time.",,
"Simply the best Sonic game of the past decade.
I think the open world formula it's right direction for the franchise and it was executed pretty well in this game.
There's a lot of stuff to do in the islands and it's fun to explore them, the artistic direction and the design of the enemies and titans is superb, the combat is simple yet requires practice to dominate, the soundtrack has bangers as expected, the story is good and leaves the door open to interesting ideas and I even enjoyed the cyberspace even if I wasn't really expecting much from it.

But even then, there's still quite the room from improvement both in technical (several bugs and general jankyness) and narrative areas (the storytelling could be polished a bit more). In regards to graphics, although acceptable for a Sonic game, could have an upgrade for the new generation. It feels like it could run perfectly on a PS3


In summary, I'll give the game a solid 8/10. If you like Sonic games, buy it without hesitation. If you are not into Sonic games, probably you would like to wait for a sale.",,
BEST SONIC GAME IN YEARS,,

"There will be spoilers ahead, review is based on completion of the game.

This was clearly a very ambitious project for Sonic Team and SEGA. An open world Sonic The Hedgehog game has been on the mind of many Sonic fans for years now. With all the proof-of-concepts that the community created, it was clear many wanted to see what Sonic would be like in the wide open.
The answer? A bit mixed.

The World At Large
The overworld of the Starfall Islands is vast, filled with ruins of an ancient civilization long forgotten. To say that it covers the ground of an ""open world"" game would be correct, and it's a rather nice looking environment. However, I found that it was ultimately lacking. The space is only really occupied by Sonic the Hedgehog game set pieces. Grind rails, springs, boost pads and all the other pieces we've seen litter the landscape like garbage strewn about. It makes the world seem a bit cobbled together and feels more like a test space than an actual world.

Cyberspace
The instanced portals scattering the landscape bring you back to fragmented zones of games past, where you must complete objectives to earn vault keys. You'll run through Green Hill, Chemical Plant, Sky Sanctuary, and Speed Highway. However, those are the only stages, the difference between levels of the same zone just being the layout of the map. I feel like this was the low point of the game, as not only does the physics in Cyberspace act differently than the overworld, but a lot of the level layouts felt really poorly designed. Obvious signs of arbitrary difficulty in the later levels and inconsistent proper difficulty throughout the game, none of the levels really feel cohesive.

Even with such a vast world to move freely in, there's still many instances where you are forced into a 2D perspective, with no way to get out of it without progressing in the environment where the camera changed. Even in the overworld this happens a lot with memory token challenges. It's a very jarring issue, which leads me into:

One of the main criticisms I've had of modern Sonic games starting with Colors onward is the constant issue of scripted sequences, or places where your inputs are suppressed while the game forces Sonic forward. This happens often with loops, spirals, boost pads into sharp turns, even sometimes with homing attacks. The game will perform inputs artificially to force you to finish the homing chain of enemies in certain parts of Cyberspace. Some memory token challenges do this as well, and it can be frustrating to have full control and then suddenly break off a platforming segment because the game thought it knew better than you did.

It's pretty clear that a lot of the challenges in the game were not focused on keeping up with Sonic's ludicrous speed. You will find yourself overshooting so often when using the boost, whether it be in Cyberspace in general, or attempting to clear a rail over a cliff in the overworld. There is also a major issue of inconsistency in its function. For instance, jumping and then boosting, in most cases, will allow you to continue boosting when you land in the overworld. However, in Cyberspace, boosting in the air will only work once as long as you remain airborne, and will cancel when you land. This causes problems with things such as grind rails with multiple paths, as you will slow down if you jump between rails.
The overworld will also fling you high into the sky if you boost over a sharp angle, even if it's not intended. While good for farming skill points when you can perform moves, this can be an issue because it often sends you in a direction opposite of your path.

I did 100% the game. I revealed every island's map, watched every side story, cleared every Cyberspace level and challenge, 100%ed every fishing spot, unlocked every skill, maxxed out all of Sonic's stats as well. It was not fun to do. A lot of it was an arduous grind. Between frustrating Cyberspace levels, navigating hundreds of memory token setups, looking up and down the islands to find Kocos, seeds, and fishing tokens, nothing about these side adventures felt fun by any means. I was extremely lucky to get so many Starfall events to get easy fishing tokens, because fishing makes the side quests 10x easier to do. But at the same time, I feel like it's a cheap gimme to farm fishing. I feel like, of my 23 hours played, at least 5 of those was spent fishing, 15 aimlessly trying to chart the map and clear Cyberspace levels, and 3 actually doing the story.

Now that I've ranted and raved about the negatives, let's talk about the positives.

When in the Overworld, Sonic is unhindered by a lot of the terrain and is very smooth. It often felt like I could get anywhere at all, and a lot of times I was right.

So much heart and soul was put into the music, particular to note were the titan battle themes. Tremendous bands to really make you feel incredible as you crush this gigantic beast that had you running not that long ago.

Once again, expect spoilers.
A lot of the previous modern titles fell flat with story and characters felt very one-note. Sonic was a 24/7 wisecracker, Tails became a coward, etc. But this time around I felt very engaged with the story, and everyone had high notes to their character. Sonic actually had some depth to him, Tails could look at himself objectively, Knuckles considered his position as a guardian, Amy actually had care for things other than Sonic, even Eggman actually showed a caring side to him. Sage felt a little bit like she was put on the sidelines, despite being a primary antagonist throughout the game. I couldn't quite find myself liking her character, but beyond that it was a great plotline.
The fact that most of the series is considered canon and is recognized by most of the cast was a great thing. Lately the plot has felt very one-off, and there was no sense of history between games.
The ancients being chaos beings was a strange choice, and I would have loved to have more information about their whole deal instead of what little we received. Where does Chaos itself fit into their ranks, considering it seems to be a similar entity? How did they come across the chaos emeralds on their planet before The End destroyed it?
What exactly is The End? It seems to be a planetoid, but it treats itself like some sort of cosmic entity beyond normal means.
There's a lot of questions to be had with this story, and I found myself wanting a bit more.

These were high enough notes to have me recommend this game. If you aren't much of a Sonic fan, this could be considered more of the same. It may even be if you are, but it's a fresh experience that resonated pretty well for me. I hope that Sonic Team can produce another game with more of its potential used.",,
"this is the best sonic game they've made in a long time and the story is genuinely interesting and picks back up where the franchise left its history to rot years ago

this game had me smiling all the way through",,
Genuinely a fantastic game. I honestly can say I got my moneys worth in pure fun and enjoyment.,,
"I personally get bored super easily of open world games bcs of how slow it can be going from point A to point B when I don't have fast travel unlocked yet, especially since I have a huge tendency to get side-tracked a lot.
But with sonic's speed I can get side-tracked as much as my heart desires and get back to the main story in a flash; which paired with the addicting combat and all the stuff to collect and upgrade, I didn't get bored once while playing this game.

This game could absolutely use some polish, especially with the several pop-ins (which I personally didn't really mind them), and having no boss rush mode after completing the story let me down considerably, since those were the highlight of the game imo. Although you can go around this ""issue"" by saving the game using the manual save slots before each boss. It's not really my idea of convenient, but hey, it's better than nothing :P


If you have the graphics preset on ""High"" and the game is completely unplayable due to extreme lag, set only the ""Shadow quality"" setting to ""Low"".
I found out that that setting alone on ""High"" is devastating on your graphics card, and once I tried having all graphics settings on max except for Shadow quality I could play the game just fine (I have a GTX 1050 graphics card, for reference).

Hands down the best story out of any sonic game imo (and it's worth noting that I also love sonic unleashed and its story); great level designs (all platforming segments in the open world included); engaging and addictive combat; amazing OST; very clever references, some of which can be pretty subtle; super diverse gameplay styles, challenges, mini-games, even fishing
Overall a super fun and enjoyable game that I can come back to play again multiple times, even if it's just to run around the open world at supersonic speed with no real objective.


Finally, as a life-long Sonic fan, I'm sending a huge thanks to Sega and Sonic Team for making this game, I personally love it a lot and it's so satisfying to see that it's doing as well as it is! I'm looking forward for what's next to come for the blue blur!",,
"The big world really lends itself to Sonic's speed and some of the later boss battles feel like Metal Gear Rising in the best way, a really ambitious refresh on Sonic they leaves me very interested in where they go forward",,
"I've been playing this game for around 10 hours now excluding time spent idling in the menus, and I'm currently nearing the end of the second island, and I gotta say: this game is glorious. Not perfect, no, it has its flaws as any Sonic game would (like Sonic ramping off of tiny terrain bits and nearly launching into orbit, which is great for skill points if you have that skill), but those don't take away from my enjoyment of it in the slightest.

I haven't felt this drawn into a Sonic game since Generations in 2011 - 11 years ago! - but this definitely feels like the triumphant return or reemergence of a franchise mascot we'd all thought doomed to, at best, mediocrity. The music is fitting - the open zones feel mysterious and adventurous, cyberspace has varying themes yet all of them are pretty dope, and the Titans, the main bosses of each island--

Oh. My. .

Sonic Team, you did have to go this hard with the boss music, yet you did, and I love you to death for it.

I just hope they learn from this success and don't repeat their past mistake of veering off into a completely different - and disappointing - direction, because this game is really something special. If you're on the fence but at all curious, I highly recommend picking it up and giving it a try.",,

(THIS REVIEW IS WRITTEN BY LIFELONG SONIC FAN, TAKE WITH GRAIN OF SALT)

Really good game, lays the groundwork for future games in this style to come. Physics are nowhere near perfect, but it does feel good to control Sonic. Graphical issues exist, but it didn't really take away from my experience. Combat with normal enemies are nothing, mini-bosses are quite challenging when dealing with their gimmicks. Cyber Space is the main point of improvement, they're arcade-y levels designed to be replayed to optimize time but the physics don't lend themselves well to it. Boss fights are filled with amazing visuals and songs, but are easily trounced if you've leveled at all. My recommendation is to never level combat at all, enemies go down far too quickly at later levels (Never gets unbearably hard doing this). Final boss was incredibly disappointing for Sonic standards, which I'm really sad about considering how all the bosses before were great. Story is good with really good characterization of the characters, I think SAGE is one of my favorites in the series after this game.

It's an 8/10 for me, a lot of room for improvement but the bones on this game are really fun, looking forward to how they iterate on it.",,

"Fantastic foundation of Sonic so far. I really hope to see more open-zone gameplay in future games and would love to see more raw Super Sonic moments in the future. I love the gameplay, the character dynamics, the music, oddly enough, the cyberspace stages and ESPECIALLY the story. I have not been this emotionally invested in a Sonic story since Unleashed and hope Ian Flynn is here to stay.

Though my main gripes have been: The entirety of Chaos Island, 2D cyberspace stages, that slide stage, a lot of references were awesome but I found myself thinking some were overdone.

All and all I loved this game to death throughout my full playthrough. It was such a unique experience and can't wait for the other games in this new era for Sonic!",,
"while the game has weird issues like pop-in, weird physics and such,
the pros at least for me vastly outweigh the cons
running around in the open zone is just a joy and hope it gets expanded on in the future
the super sonic fights are some of the best boss fights in the series if you ask me, with very great songs to boot
the cyberspace levels may have weird physics and lack of themes but after a while of getting used to them, i love just seeing what this new sonic can do, and the mysterious songs that play in cyberspace while either knowing or not knowing exactly what level youre playing is cool feeling if im being honest
overall its a cool game and i hope itll just keep getting better",,

would recommend!",,

best 3d sonic game since unleashed,,
"i played for twenty hours straight and forgot who i was, ten out of ten",,
"Sonic is back at last, after a decade in the wilderness with half-finished games and tired, dull stories the blue blur has returned to form. Despite initial worry, this game delivers blazing fast gameplay and a simplistic but but satisfying combat. While being compared to Breath of the Wild, I think that is on looks alone, it's felt far more akin to an oddly satisfying of mix of the open-world activities from Mario Odyssey combined with the boss-fights from Shadow of the Colossus.

The story, of which I have only just gotten to the third island after completing 100% of the first two open zones, has been interesting and engaging, I actually care about the characters presented and they are not the one dimensional wisecrackers from the recent games, they have actual conversations and communicate in way I haven't seen since Sonic Unleashed. The plot is far grimmer than one one has come to expect, but that has given it a bit of an impact, and the callbacks to previous game plots has helped ground the story as well.

The gameplay is split into the open zone puzzles, token collection, boss fights and the Cyberspace time attack stages we're more used to. I've enjoyed all of it immensely, though so far the puzzles have been fairly simple, though if they had been harder, it would become frustrating considering what they unlock. Collecting the tokens gives similar dopamine hits to that of the Rare collect-a-thons.

The Cyberspace levels are a welcome break from token collection and story events with some refreshingly strict grading on them which makes them much more replayable. There are some more lenient stages but those are fun to explore as many stages use level design from past games but sometimes they are mixed together. Despite the cries about re-used assets, I found the use of them to recreate previous game's levels and expanding routes on them to be a fun surprise, especially from the Sonic Adventure stages, where the boost gameplay makes them feel quite different.

The music's quality has also returned in force with numerous bangers from cyberstages and boss themes to be heard as you go. Some of my favorites are the very first cyberspace level and the Sky Rail recreation found on the second island.

The only issues I've had with Sonic Frontiers are technical. The infamous pop-in seems least egregious on PC, and even then, this should be fixable with a patch. It hasn't impacted gameplay much if at all.

It is a very different game to watch as opposed to play, and I can only recommend it, though if you've never played one of the more modern 3D sonic games, the pacing and controls will have a bit of a learning curve. The familiar gameplay is there, but adapted to traversing the huge expanses the game has to offer. It's a good sonic game, maybe even a great one, once I've completed it, I will update this recommendation, but I've thoroughly enjoyed what I've played so far.",,
"Do not go into this game expecting a big, epic adventure on the level of Breath of the Wild. Instead, think of it like a more serious take on collectathon platformers like Banjo-Kazooie or A Hat in Time.

Normally when I play games, it's for a lot of things: the story, the music, the characters, and more. However, very rarely is it for the movement, and this changed tonight. I spent a solid 30 minutes after 100%ing everything but the Memory Tokens, just playing around and zooming along, doing whatever I wanted. This is the freedom that Sonic Frontiers offers: not just freedom to explore the open world, but freedom to just have fun with Sonic's abilities, potentially leading to some absolutely amazing things if you can break the glass skill ceiling.

The story itself is definitely more serious than other recent games, being about an ancient civilization and how they died out. As for Sonic's friends, they go through introspection while discovering the tragedy, whereas the new ""antagonist"" Sage slowly becomes more and more self-aware. While the story may not focus on Sonic, it's still a very good plot, even if it is mainly told through lore.

The Cyber Space levels are a bit weird. These levels are generated from Sonic's memories, resulting in stages that seem familiar, but are recontextualized due to being in different level themes. These include levels from the Classic and Dreamcast eras with Boost physics, and levels from the Modern era with a boost that doesn't hurt enemies. However, some of them are incredibly fun, and each level has a high-energy EDM theme to go with it. There's only four level themes, though, so it would get a bit repetitive if there weren't just 30. The level theme changes seem designed to cause feelings of confusion and deja vu in players who know these stages by heart. For example, the 22nd one is a Chemical Plant stage, but after some time I noticed an odd amount of Light Speed Dash lines, and eventually a very familiar homing attack chain - it was Metal Harbor from Sonic Adventure 2!

The meat of the game isn't in Cyber Space, though, but in the open world. There are three islands to explore, but don't expect them to be like Breath of the Wild, where you can go straight to the end without preparation. Instead, think of it as a high-speed collectathon platformer, akin to Super Mario 64, Banjo-Kazooie, or A Hat in Time. Your goal is to find Chaos Emeralds, which are obtained with either ""Memory Tokens"" (similar to Power Moons in Mario Odyssey - strewn around everywhere with tiny challenges to clear) or Vault Keys (similar to Stars in Mario 64 - collect them by clearing bigger missions, particularly in Cyber Space). Vault Keys themselves can only be obtained in Cyber Space portals, only accessible by fighting minibosses, getting Portal Gears from them, and spending them to open portals. Memory Tokens, meanwhile, start discussions with other characters, which can sometimes lead to Sonic finding a Chaos Emerald or getting to a new part of the map (though these can take some time to notice). Getting six Chaos Emeralds will lead to an encounter with a Titan, the boss of an island - the goal typically involves racing to the top of its head, getting the final Chaos Emerald, and thus becoming Super Sonic in order to match the Titan's power. These fights are kept secret by Sega for a reason, and I won't spoil them.

All in all, Sonic Frontiers has its flaws, but it's a solid entry in the Sonic series, perhaps one of the best. Sonic is back.",,

Do NOT rush through the story! Enjoy the content and try to get 100% before you move on. You won't regret it.,,
"As a long-time fan of the series, this has been a serious breath of fresh air for the franchise. It's not perfect. Controls in Cyberspace feel off at first, Cyberspace stages in general can have the issue Forces had with stages being too short/too easy to S Rank, the overall progression system can feel pretty repetitive at times, and the game lacks some technical polish. While not game-breaking or really annoying I did come across some visual glitches that admittedly got a good laugh out of me at points. However, even with these flaws, I was just taken aback by how much I loved playing Frontiers. The open world is so much fun to traverse and the challenges contained in them are a lot of fun. The combat while a bit button mashy still feels really satisfying to pull off with the upgrade tree really allowing for some crazy combo potential. With that note, the bosses are just incredible. Each one is a complete spectacle and raises the stakes and challenges with each one. The music in these fights and the games ost in general really help to sell them as well. The variety and overall quality of the ost are just insane. Finally, the story and overall writing are such a major step up it's not even funny. Not since Unleashed have I cried during a sonic game in the way I have playing this game. Lots of beautiful melodramatic and heart-pulling scenes mixed in with some really great character interaction from the cast that I felt we haven't seen done this well since the 2000s. The voice acting in general was also great (even if rogers new direction took some getting used to) with one or two occasional weird line reads (once again mostly from rogers new voice direction with sonic). Overall while not perfect this game was such a treat to experience. I hope future games build off this formula and improve what flaws this game does have to make something truly incredible. Here's hoping for a bright future for the series!

P.S. This game has big in it and you can fish with him so this also makes this game an objective masterpiece. Sorry I don't make the rules lmao",,

"SONIC IS BACK

SONIC IS FINALLY BACK",,
"I often dont leave game reviews, but this is a time where its very warranted. I was obsessed with Sonic when I was a kid, it was one of my favorite series and I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ loved it. However I fell off kinda hard once Black Knight came out, which, I did play and had a lot of fun with it (even though its not good) afterwards I just kinda left Sonic behind for almost 12 full year, not even playing Generations until this year. I occasionally went back to the older games for nostalgias sake. But this game was very different, it really awoke pure nostalgia in me whenever they started to put out the trailers that werent utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It made me pick up the games I ended up missing, and it took me back to a very comfortable place in my life for a bit. Then when it finally came out, it was like Christmas with Sonic Games as a kid all over again. This game came out 2 days before my birthday, and honestly it couldn't have been more comforting and nostalgic to play even though with each day I feel old as ♥♥♥♥. Now unfortunately, this games not perfect, there is still a LOT of Sonic jank that seems to persist throughout the boost games and some less than stellar side content. Let me just get the bad stuff out of the way.

The Bad:
1. The Cyberspace levels overall are just... kinda bland and dumb. Everyone knows at this point pretty much all of them derive from the older games, and almost none are original, and they LOOK bland because there's only 4 aesthetic styles: Green Hill, Sky Sanctuary, City Escape, and Chemical Plant. Those arent inherently bad but it really gets old by the third Island. I will give credit there are some distinct CS levels that arent actually based on boost game levels, like Radical Highway, White Jungle, and Sky Rail, which as someone who loves SA2s stage design to death, was refreshing to what Sonic has been for the last 15 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ years. Also, the physics in these levels SUCK. Unless they're the previously mentioned SA2 or select full 3D levels, the 2d ones suck, they suck so bad. The Physics do NOT feel right and the boost does ♥♥♥♥ all. It sucks. It honestly feels worse than Classic Sonic in Forces. The music is still pretty good as always at least.
2. While the overall gameplay for the Open Zones is really good, man it SUCKS that Sonic still has to rely on boost to go fast. I honestly wish they would have let Sonic run as fast as he does in the Adventure Era.
3. Everyone ♥♥♥♥♥ on it, everyone hates it, and I used to call it an unreasonable complaint, but man when you're playing it and collecting, it becomes very apparent. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Draw Distance. I dont care about it graphically, that doesnt bother me. What DOES bother me is Ill see some collectibles just floating in free air and you wonder ""How do I get that?"" And then you look around and nothing is there because of how short the draw distance is. I get that its a lot of props coming into play but at that point why would you not just build stuff like that INTO the environment? And lets not even get into the fact by the 3rd island 80% of those rail, platform, spring, etc. sections to collect tokens FORCE you into 2D and you CANT get out of it unless you go back. It breaks the pace of trying to run from Point A to B in Open Zone. Its dumb and gets old IMMEDIATELY. STOP HAVING SO MUCH 2D ♥♥♥♥ IN BOOST GAMES.
4. They REALLY do not make some things in gameplay obvious. Like the parry. The dialogue box makes it feel like what you should be doing is pressing L&R bumpers when a hit is about to hit you which is an option but its really bad. What you SHOULD be doing is HOLDING L&R bumpers to parry. I did not figure this out until BEATING Boss 2 which is ALL PARRY BASED.
5. As far as content as a whole goes, you can beat pretty much fully complete the game in 20 hrs. Everything. Thats not a bad thing, but for an Open World Style game, there should be at least a decent amount of stuff to do on the side or after main game. Once you beat the game the only thing you get is Arcade mode which is on the main title screen and its JUST the CS levels. Not even some of the minigames from the main story, which as far as Im aware, you can't go back and play them whenever you like. The minigames are kinda meh, they're not bad they're not great. Ones Pinball, and ones Ikaruga. In story they're annoying but it would have at least been cool to have them in the Arcade Mode.
6. Combat while really well made, is kinda stiff when you have everything unlocked. And some are really annoying. Also they take EVERY opportunity to make sure you don't get to experience Phantom Rush for more than 3 seconds. Which sucks because Phantom Rush is one of the most satisfying parts of combat.
7. They really hyped me up with the costumes from preorders, I thought thered be more but there's 3 total... classic, SA2 Shoes, and the Adventurer Items. There's one for Monster Hunter soon but... that's literally it. Why even go out of their way to advertise something like that if there's only 3 choices in the entire game?

The GOOD ♥♥♥♥:
1. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this is the most fun I've had for boost formula game play period. Again, while it sucks in CS, its AMAZING in Open Zone. This the first time since SA2 that I actually can feel Sonics speed. I still think SA1&2 style movement would have been better. But logically having a walking speed for doing puzzles and what not and Boost for covering ground is the right way to go. Also I found it really neat they implemented the Blue Electricity Speed from the movies. That ♥♥♥♥ dope.
2. The performance on PC is actually so good! I'm shocked. I only got 1 place in the game to chug at 1920x1440, 60fps, max settings. The only place where it suffers is cutscenes which seems to be a theme with Sonic PC ports ever since Generations. Not bad but just look grosser compared to gameplay.
3. The controls are rock solid everything makes sense. My only complaint is man does the right trigger get abused like crazy for boosting.
4. This game looks extremely pretty. I was worried it would look more Generic and only green, but, there's some genuinely pretty areas and ANY area with flora is chef's kiss.
5. The open zone maps are the perfect size. The 1st map kinda teases you with half a damn map but overall it's perfect.
6. The Music. ESPECIALLY BOSS MUSIC. Enough said.
7. The Boss fights are the best in the 3D games, period. You can not change my mind.
8. The writing is some of the best period. The last Sonic game to actually make me feel emotions was SA2. Black Knight's themes and messages were good, but is hard to take seriously because of the game itself. This however has it's own rules and themes and an actually COMPETENT writer. No line in this game made me actually cringe. At worst I felt indifferent. At best I was genuinely touched with character moments and development. E S P E C I A L L Y from Tails. They did Tails some well-deserved justice. They made Amy a very likable character and not an obsessed fangirl of Sonic. They made her an actual character and even tossed the idea of ""Hm, maybe I should go my own way a bit."" Which is a big theme in this game; finding your own path. Which ties into the gameplay therefore making an appropriate theme and not feel out of place. They also didnt make Knuckles a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ idiot again thank GOD. And even shockingly, EGGMAN has some moments where I genuinely got emotional and get to see a side of Eggman not seen since (like a broken record) SA2.
9. I did not run into a single major glitch in the 20 hrs I played. Not one. Well ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ done Sonic Team.

I cant recommend this game enough if youre a Sonic fan, or not even. Its just a very good game and its the best step in the right direction since Generations. Please support this game, we need more Sonic games like it, or even ones that will evolve into better games. Thanks Sega for a great B-Day gift, please make more like this.",,
"Just finished Sonic Frontiers. And the game is actually... good.
HOWEVER...
It could have been so much better. Why? Because the game is unfinished and SEGA has learned NOTHING.

The beginning is great. The first island is super fun to explore and has a lot of stuff to do, and the next 2 islands are even bigger, with Ares being my favourite one, with tons of mini platforming challeanges that you can find at every corner, rewarding you with various collectibles. Sonic in the open zone is extremely fun to control in the open world. Turning works great, the jump feels quite decent and it's easy to control, and the boost gives you just the right amount of speed. The combat is not amazing, sometimes it's a bit janky and some enemies just aren't fun to fight, but there's still fun to be had, especially with the bosses, that range from quite good to awesome, like the crazy Super Sonic titan bossfights with kickass music that sounds straight out of Metal Gear Rising and crazy action cutscenes, it's just an awesome power trip and they are hella fun, despite them being pretty broken and janky.
The soundtrack is also overall quite good, despite not being as good as the Crush40's ones.

However, cyberspace SUCKS. The controls are terrible and broken, and i really wonder how they ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it up this badly, and it's here that the cracks due to the game being rushed start to show : Half of the levels have recycled layouts and there are only 4 level themes in the game, which 3 of them are recycled from Generations. If the game had more development time, there would be at least more level themes.

When the game really starts to fall apart is after the 3rd island (which is also pretty good). The 4th island is literally the other side of Kronos, that was clearly cut due to time constraints, and there is NOTHING to do, except for climbing a few towers, and after climbing each one, a cutscene will trigger. SPOILER WARNING!







Now, for more technical stuff and visuals :
The technical side of this game leaves a lot to be desired. The visuals are pretty good for the most part but not amazing, except for the lighting that looks AMAZING, and the TAA is excellent. But the big issues lie withing the horrible pop-in, the lackluster graphics settings and no unlocked FPS, and the game has DENUVO. ♥♥♥♥ you Irdeto, SEGA and your garbage DRM.

THE VERDICT :
Sonic Frontiers is definitely an exciting step in the right direction for the series, bringing back the more serious tone of the 2000s games, introducing great gameplay ideas and making the controls better than ever, and bringing back continuity with old games, instead of making the story completely self-contained. It's a very, very fun game, and it's overall quite good, a solid 7.5/10 for me, but if the game wasn't rushed and left unfinished, and given 1 year and an half more development time, this game could have been something truly excellent.

Overall reccomended, especially if you are a die-hard Sonic Fan, or even if you enjoy 3D platformers and collect-a-thons in general.",,
"Best 3D Sonic game in forever, probably my new favorite. The open world zones flow so well as each platforming challenge will tend to lead to a new one. The combat is simple and can be button mashy, but as you unlock new combos the fights can be really flashy and fun as your bouncing between enemies with awesome looking moves. Boss fights in the open world are also generally pretty good, the majority of them have unique mechanics to differentiate them but i found most of them to be pretty easy. The main story boss fights, however, are straight banger after banger. The music furring these fights are incredible, they're super flashy and some of them where even a little difficult. Cyberspace was a bit of a mixed bag for me, for some reason the great open world physics do not translate to cyberspace and it took me a while to get used to. I don't like how Sonic controls in these segments very much, but the design of the levels and the music in them made them a lot of fun regardless. Lastly, I enjoyed the story and voice acting a lot, such a step up from the previous 3D Sonic games. Having lore connecting the games (mainly the adventure titles, that ♥♥♥♥ made me real happy to see) had me pretty interested to see where things where going next. My biggest complaint in regards of the story where the cut scenes. They where not animated that well, and consisted of two characters standing around and talking as the camera panned around different angles.

I think Frontiers is an incredible Sonic game and also a great game in general. I really hope Sega keeps this new direction and fleshes it out even more.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is by far one of the best Sonic games that I have ever played and is the first ever Sonic game that has done an open world game. The writing and the emotional scenes is what really makes this game so enjoyable. Not only that but the overall game play is endless and has so many challenges that you can do. There are also the Cyber Space levels that gives the players levels of past Sonic games so that OG fans for Sonic will enjoy the game as well. I believe this is most likely my favourite ever Sonic game, and is a great first attempt at finally giving us an open world game. Overall I will personally give this Sonic game a 10/10 and would recommend it to other players who are just getting into the Sonic franchise or who are interested of trying out this wonderful game. Thank you SEGA and SONIC TEAM for finally giving the Sonic Series a fantastic game the 5 year wait was worth it :)",,
"I absolutely loved this game, the controls felt great and Sonic's new attacks were fun and interesting.
This is definitely a game any Sonic fan should try. I have seen other people saying they have had issues running the game and crashes, but i have had none of that. The UI could use some work, it is too slow to allow you to make selections in game eg. the upgrades for Sonic's attack and defense, you cannot make the selection as soon as the options show up, you have to wait a moment, which gets annoying after a while when trying to upgrade many levels at once.

All the achievements are a fun challenge to get, but not overly difficult, i completed the game and all achievements in 25 hours and spent a few hours in the fishing mini game.",,
You can fish,,

"THIS GAME IS AMAZING.
If you loved Sonic Adventure you'll LOVE this game.
The boss fights are insanely cool and fun, there's levels integrated into the open world, the dialogue and dynamics feel natural, the music is INCREDIBLE and it controls SO much better than previous 3D Sonic games.
SADX is still my favourite in my heart of course but I am absolutely in love with this game.
(Took me 18 hours to beat, I had 100% the fishing minigames, side stories and maxed out strength and defense, there's a lot of playtime, I've yet to get all achievements)",,
"I absolutely enjoyed this game, probably the best game since Sonic Generation in all honesty.

I 100% the game and collected all of the achievements, it was an absolute joy ride and it was fun in every way possible, I think the only thing I'll mention the downside to this is how repetitive the game can get. Every island will have you do the same thing, explore, fight the guardians and then play the levels. Which is a good concept, but I think it wore itself out by the third island.

Non the less, I hope they keep this formula and expand upon it, I think Sonic Team got themselves a good mixture between Sonic Adventure and Sonic Unleash style game play.

I give this game a 8/10.",,
"This is the game I have wanted, having grown up with the best games in the franchise, for close to 2 decades. It's got some small scuffs here and there, I barely remember them. All I remember is skittering around these large worlds, and enjoying what I was doing in them. The Cyberspace segments have a few not-so-great ones, but almost all of them have their own unique feel and many have interesting gimmicks, none feel too alike to one another. 100%'ing this game is easy, and I recommend it if you at all care about the characters and overall universe of the franchise. This formula is an incredibly solid and engaging basis, I want more of exactly this, with maybe stronger art direction. I feel like, finally, after so long, the best Sonic game to ever be made may not be in the past, but the future.",,
"After the tragedy that is Forces, it's refreshing to finally play just a good sonic game. The musics great, the voice acting is solid and has clear direction , the gameplay is rewarding and encourages exploration, YOU CAN GO FISHING?!

I just feel like there should've been more when it comes to the actual story, it feels like it ends abruptly and that there was supposed to be more.

It's a solid 7.5/10, which is an anomaly for a Sonic game made in the past like 15 years. I think this game is a huge step in the right direction for SEGA.",,
"genuinely loved it, despite the little qualms i have with some controls and camera issues ive adored the story and are absolutely looking forward to where sonic team goes from here !! theyre finally maturing the characters and frontiers is such a good recipe for greatness once it starts becoming more and more polished. solid i made my friend cry while playing/10",,
"I'm speechless.
I feel so lucky that I'm alive at this moment to see my favorite boy finally being treated right. This is a love letter to us, Sonic fans. Thank you.",,
Everything as it should be...a master piece...enough to make a person with nostalgia cry...,,
first real sonic game in almost 15 years. this game is phenomenal,,
Sonic is awesome again,,
"As a person who's been playing Sonic since I was a little kid, this game made me feel the wonder that I felt as a little kid playing through zones in the older classic games. This game is phenomenal, and probably my favorite Sonic game now. The story is wonderful, the music is fantastic, and the gameplay is very fluid. That being said, there were a couple ups and downs, but nothing major enough to feel like I was ever actively having a bad time.
tl;dr, this is one of the good ones.",,

"While far from a perfect game the direction and tone of this game far exceed anything made in the past fifteen years. While overall controls could do with tightening up even beyond available options and semi clunky cyber-space levels hold the game back a little, the respect shown to the series history and a bold new step forward is just what this franchise needed.

The first time these characters have felt like themselves in fifteen years. Ian Flyn worked wonders.",,
"One of, if not the biggest W's in the franchise.

Pure fun gameplay, stellar music, and tasteful references/callbacks woven into the story and character exchanges. If you're a longtime fan of the game series (and even the IDW comics), you're in for a treat that was made with genuine passion.",,
"“It’s been 84 years…”

I can’t believe this game exists, but I’m so happy it does. Being a huge Sonic fan since the days of owning a Genesis and a Game Gear and thinking of my 12 year old self playing one of my favorite games of all time, Sonic Adventure 2, I feel like I have waited about 20 years for another amazing Sonic game. Well, it’s finally here and Sonic Frontiers is it. I’m only 5 hours in, and so far it already feels like the hedgehog is truly back and I could not be happier.

What a special treat and a treasure that this game is as good as it is, and to finally get something close to the Sonic Adventure 3 I never had. From the open free roam gameplay, to the awesome challenges, level designs, boss fights, engaging story, and amazing soundtrack, THIS is what the future of Sonic ALWAYS should have been. I really hope that Sega and Sonic Team take in all the praise, and let this be the groundwork for the future.

This is what us Sonic fans have been waiting for, and I’m loving every minute of it!",,
"10/10 if you like sonic this is 100% something to buy. Seriously love this game, its got me feeling nostalgia/rage/peace/love/etc and I haven't even finished it yet. Update - I've finished the first island and didn't expect so much content from this game, its amazing.",,

"a great sonic game !!
not perfect, needs some QoL and could've done with SEGA not rushing it out of the door, but if sonic games in the future build off of this, then i can see this being the start of a golden age.

p.s. i'm so glad the characters feel like, well, actual characters again.",,
"While certainly not the best Sonic game, Sonic Frontiers is a clear winner amongst the MID of Sonic games released over the last 10 years. The controls are great, bosses are some of the best in the entire series, music slaps, story knocks it out of the park compared to the last couple games, and the character interactions are stellar! My main complaints have to do with the camera jankiness, , and 2D sections that sometimes restrict you from going where you want to go along the islands. This lays a great framework for future 3D Sonic games and I'm extremely optimistic for where the series is heading now.",,
"The bastards actually did it. They managed to make an open-world Sonic game and it's actually pretty good. There's absolutely a decent amount of jank. It's clear that the devs struggled to get the camera in particular to cooperate in various circumstances, but the quote from whoever it was about this being the foundation for Sonic for the next however-many years rings true. It feels like a foundation, like a stepping stone into a new format for Sonic games.

Could some of the systems be better executed? Absolutely. The sparseness of the skill tree and hilarious exponential increase in skill point requirements shows the devs couldn't come up with enough skills to accommodate the skill point system they designed. Similarly, the combat is barebones, at best, with aspirations of being Eggman May Cry while not even reaching Sonic Unleashed's level of depth. The means of progressing via finding tokens randomly placed throughout the world feels almost crowbar'ed in, like they needed to spread out the story beats just a tad bit more. Everything just plain feels like it's on the cusp of something truly remarkable, sort of like Adventure before Adventure 2.

Where the game shines is in its platforming segments, which often toe the line between melting my aging millennial brain and making me feel a similar sense of freedom and exhilaration as freerunning in Mirror's Edge. The typical Boost Gameplay of the last decade still presents itself, but in bite-sized chunks that almost feel like a mobile game version of Sonic Generations. This is not a bad thing, as it allows for one to quickly memorize the layout of a given stage and repeatedly retry to complete the missions tied to each one. Given that performing such feats is tied directly to overall progression, I would hate to have to play through a 3+ minute stage 5 times to get all the red rings or complete the stage with an S rank. In Frontiers, even if I get frustrated with a level, I can jump out and go do Open Zone missions or try a different one. There's a fantastic balance between casual friendliness and hardcore Sonic fan challenge.

Speaking of hardcore Sonic fans, the storyline is the most melodramatic schlock bordering on self-parody that we've had since Sonic 06, and I absolutely love it. Granted, I'm only approximately 1/4 of my way through the game, and so it could make a hard turn into trashville, but the emotional intensity of the marketing for this game along with the actual content thereof indicates to me that they knew exactly what they were going for with Frontiers: Final Fantasy-grade emotional drama with hyper-stylized anthropomorphic animals. There have already been several beats which bring back memories of 06's writing, as well as some moments from Adventure. It feels like they're finally making good on the ""mature"" story that Forces tried and failed at telling, even if it has all the emotional impact of a soap opera starring a cast of furries. All that said, non-Sonic fans will almost definitely mock the story for trying to take a game about characters that look like they belong on cereal boxes as seriously as any other JRPG. It all feels much more melancholic than a Sonic game has any right to be, and I think it's all the better for it, but normies will invariably pass it off as the goofiness that it is.

One other thing I wanted to mention but I couldn't think of anywhere to throw it in: I do not like how they directed Roger Craig Smith to play Sonic this time around. I genuinely can't tell whether they told him to voice Sonic at least half an octave lower than normal, or if they took his lines and pitched them down in editing, but it sounds like Sonic went through puberty since Forces. I assume the idea was that they wanted Sonic to sound more ""mature"" to try to feed into the idea of it being a more serious story, but I whole-heartedly disagree with this notion. Sonic fans were able to take him seriously when he was wishing his friends well before his presumed death in SA2 (yes I know that was Griffith but that's unimportant); they'd be able to take him seriously in his typical tone of voice here. I would not be surprised if a ""fixed voice over"" mod were to come out that replaced all of the voice lines with ones that were simply pitched up by 15%.

Oh, and one last thing: Denuvo. Sega, I know you're terrified of pirates, but come the hell on. There is no way you would have lost as many sales as what Denuvo is costing to license for this thing. Not to mention, the game's on Switch, so anyone who wants to pirate it will just download the Switch version, instead.

Addendum: I have now finished the game and would decisively call Sonic Frontiers a strong 7 to a light 8. If it wasn't held back by some technical shortcomings and some obviously rushed portions near the end, it would be a strong 8. In spite of the issues I have with it, this is undoubtedly in my top 5 Sonic games, possibly top 3. The final ~3 hours of the game contain what are without a doubt the strongest narrative beats the franchise has seen since Adventure 2, and some spectacular platforming segments that manage to work together to create actual tension that's executed better than in many narrative-focused games. I do wish that some things like the fight, the , the fact that , the way that is brought up and then kind of forgotten about, etc. were done differently, but it seems pretty obvious that this was running out of either time or budget when some of these things could have been ironed out.

I absolutely maintain that this is an exciting new for Sonic, and considering the game looks to be a sales success, I truly hope that whatever comes next is everything that this game was trying to be and more. I very much believe that if Sonic Team is given the time and resources they need to build upon the foundation they've laid, we could see another Sonic Adventure into Sonic Adventure 2 evolution from promising concept to franchise-defining masterpiece.",,
"Snack Frontiers is the most Sonic game in the song the hedgehog franchise. He run faster than my lambikini 🚗 Scary girl called saggy 👧 is very scary 😨. Egg man is funny man 🥚 Why is he an egg 😹😹 music is very music 🎶

Downsides: too much grass. Too much tree 🌳 they copy the hit game mindcrap.... Too healthy for me. Lots of sand. I don't like sand getting in my feet. Too much robots 🤖 they scary 🤯🤯🤯🤯

10/10 must play",,
"not incredible, not the best sonic game ever, but my god is it good, well tedious and bland on occasion its genuinely really fun to play and just a blast to advance in

big recommend, while the open world formula isnt for everyone, you'll be pleasantly surprised if you've been waiting for a good sonic game like me lol",,
"not even done with the first island at the time of writing this BUT:

THIS ♥♥♥♥ GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD GAAAAAAAAH DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMNNN
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",,
Sonic is back!,,
Sega beat the bad sonic game allegations. So happy for them,,
This is my Game of the Year since I cannot afford God of War Ragnarok,,
"Sonic Team has a winning formula here. Great game. They can do a lot better.

Pros:

-Most character development to have ever exist in a Sonic game.
-""Open Zone"" sandbox gives a ton of freedom to tackle things how you want to. Game doesn't hold your hand past the first 30 minutes.
-Killer sound track.
-Combat is simple and flashy, but engaging. Isn't a one button masher had depth that can be expolored with the skill tree. Skill tree even has an optional auto 1 button mode.
-Boss fights did DragonBall better than DragonBall.
-First Sonic Team game to have proper voice direction.
-Fishing mini game is both relaxing and a nice break from the action. It still benefits the overall game progression by playing.
-Ability to fine tune how Sonic moves by editing the turn radius, max speed, etc.
-If game ending is anything to go by, I'm looking forward to each character's development in the next Sonic title.


Cons:
-Character animation lacks emotion. The animators hold back with not animating something as fundamental as the characters' eyebrows to display emotion. They opt in on using the eye lids, which doesn't give off the same effect.
-Cyberspace levels are mixed to bad. Taking past level layouts is a neat idea, absolutely. But the idea falls flat when the Sonic game made with those levels didn't have Frontiers in mind. Expect to either run into a lot of walls or fall off on levels based on Sonic Unleashed / Generations. Stages based on anything SA2 or older work like a dream. Sonic is also pretty slow exclusively in Cyberspace and while in Cyberspace, his in air control is dismal to the point where it rivals Little Mac from Smash Bros.
-Floating platforms that contain obstacle courses and mini adventures feel like an after thought or a fan project. Sometimes, they look unnatural with their surrounding environment.

Spoiler warning:
-4th island isn't an island so much as its a set of obstacle courses required for the story. There's no collectibles in it. Once you pass it in the story, there's no incentive to go back.


Now for the meat and potatoes. Is this game a good PC port...?

No.
It's missing some PC centric features:
-Missing HDR support.
-No native ultrawide support.
-Render resolution can only go down in incriments of 25%.
-Game has a hard cap of 60fps.
30fps for curscenes.

It is optimized well in the sense I was able to have a true, locked 4k@60fps on a 2080Ti.

I had a ball, and this is a wonderful step in the right direction.

If I could change anything from this game from my cons list, it would be just the cutscene animations to push more emotion in each of the characters actions.",,
SONIC!!!,,
this game is good. but it can be better,,
"Very fun to play, Very interesting story, Very interesting combat, And overall an amazing game. I didn't expect this game to be this good. I was expecting a lot of problems but i rarely ran into any. The only problem I seem to have is the very frequent pop in for objects and terrain. Its very excusable though. The first island in the game is very fresh and fun right from the start. So far of my 8.3 hour journey with this game the first island is my favorite. The boss fight was amazing and learning to new combat skills through the skill tree was very fun. discovering the mysterious of the starfall islands were very fun as well. The voice acting and writing for this game is also great.

Cyber-space is a new addition to the Sonic games and is very fun as well. Racing against the clock like the old games is a very refreshing feel. Going back to previously explore zones in cyber-space brought some nostalgia. Cyber-space is pretty challenging as well, having to do multiple task in order to get more vault keys and new high-score.

The way this game also references other game characters and events from some Sonic titles is always fun to point out. The game also does very well on showing the bond between Sonic and his friends, also shows eggman with emotion too.

This game is truly great and I want to play all the time but I want to savor ever second of gameplay and let it sink in. I'm currently at the very beginning of the 3rd island. This game is a 9.5/10 for me. the reason it doesn't get a 10/10 is because of the controls in cyber-space and the frequent pop in, that's it. I high recommend the game to anyone who sees this and hope you enjoy Sonic frontiers!",,
good,,
holy frickin crap is this game GOOD,,
"This game is peak. Don't trust the reviewers saying it's just alright. The game is absolutely amazing, a lot of things to do, it's just really fun to move around and the sense of progression as you keep going is definitely there. I'm just on the second island, and I'm already having the time of my life.

10/10 PLEASE PLAY THIS GAME!",,
"this is really worth waiting for, all in all, a great, wonderful Sonic, maybe even the best Sonic game of all time. big recommendation for this masterpiece",,
"thus far, this game is way better than cookie clicker",,
Fast,,
"If you like Banjo and Mario mixed with some Sonic goodness from SA2 and Generations, you may love this game alot, got through the first titan fight and it is amazing.",,
This is the best Sonic experience I've had in a very long time. Anyone who thinks Sonic doesn't belong in the open world genre is wrong. Opinion doesn't count. +L +Ratio. Cope. Seethe. Screw.,,
"The level of presentation is INSANE, never seen before in Sonic games. The writing seems amazing as well so far in 6 hours!

20 hours in, the game is still amazing! Sure, it does feel a little bit clunky at times, but it never ever ruins the experience. It's just too fun to play around and be Sonic. The story is really good and redeems a lot in the past decade. Give it a go for yourself and try not to be too picky about graphics or animations. This game is more about the gameplay and story with some awesome worldbuilding. When it works, it works in the best ways possible.",,
"After 4 hours I can confidently say as a big Sonic fan: this game is hitting all the right spots for me. Not only is it a fresh take on Sonic with fun combat and exploration, it also has a good story which has been desperately needed.",,
"i never thought there'd be a sonic game i'd love as much as generations but man, i think frontiers has completely changed that. i'm not even finished yet (i'm up to chaos island) and i can safely say this has been the most fun i've ever had with a sonic game! the story, the tone, the gameplay, everything is exactly how i was hoping it would be. i'm so incredibly happy right now :')

also the pc port works great! it's lacking a lot of graphics options that most pc games have and it's a bit of a shame that it's capped at 60fps but not a deal-breaker for me at all because everything else is fine!",,
"Keep it up Sega! Finally sth Adventure-like with a more or less mysterious and interesting plot. The open world with quests and missions make this game look like a serious modern AAA (Cyberpunk, Control, Marvel's spider-man). Seems like Sonic is getting back on his feet after all these Lost World, Boom, Forces and other stuff, I hope the next games will follow this direction.",,
I think this gives many sonic fans a feel of rebirth and nostalgia when playing this game. sonic has some movement issues that would just need to be tweaked but not a huge issue since he smoothens out a bit more with higher levels.,,
"Honestly, Very good sonic game. If Team Sonic and SEGA keep up with this formula with a few more tweaks then I say this franchise is going in good direction it finally deserves.",,
It fun Sonic playground that I hope Sonic Team use this as a stepping stone definitely,,
YOU CAN GO FISHING WITH BIG!!!!! And the rest of the game is there too I guess,,
"I liked sonic frontiers, very much, an absurd amount, an amount you can never calculate.",,
peak,,
"Sonic Frontiers is the savior the Sonic Franchise has needed in the modern day. Never in my life have I felt this excited playing a 3D Sonic Game, and I've played all the mainline 3D games. The controls take a bit to get used to, and the skill tree system is a nice way of making you feel rewarded. Not only that, if you don't feel confident in your abilities, the difficulty system actually does something *cough* not forces *cough*. Other than that, Sonic Frontiers is an amazing game, and it shows that Sonic Team can still make good games. This isn't perfect or a masterpiece, but it is a damn good game that shouldn't be overlooked",,
Didn't expect the music to make it Sonic Frontiers Revengeance. Solid game,,
"I definitely had a ""honeymoon phase"" with this game when it first came out. At first I thought this was a 9/10 when it released. After some time I think I would say this game is a 7 or 7.5/10. It's overall fun and fluid in its base state. There are also a lot of easy-to-use mods out there that can enhance your experience (some of these mods are game changing).",,

"One of the best Sonic games, long time fan speaking here.
Been through thick and thin since 2001, this game made me fall in love with the franchise again.
Feels like the past 10 years of whatever the hell Pontaff were on about are finally over, the OST is one of my favorites, I really appreciate the overall tone and atmosphere.
The islands are all pretty well designed and movement works well. There's some jank because of the mesh collisions, there's definitely some things to overlook, but the Open Zone is a solid 9 for me.
It's comparable to the good open world games like BoTW and Elden Ring, imo.
It's not really fair to call it open world, cause it is indeed an open zone thing, it's one of those things you really have to try in order to understand.
The game controls better than it looks like from videos, mostly because some animations are pretty stiff.
The Cyberspace stages are 50/50, some are extremely lame, the 2D ones specifically, some range from good to OK.
The best ones come from SA2, obviously. The few original ones are okay, I wish they dared more.
The controls in Cyberspace are ""fine"" in 3D but completely ass in 2D.
Cyberspace is a very small portion of the game nevertheless, and 100% that side took me 40 minutes at most.

The SuperSonic boss fights are the best in the series, hands down, wish there was a boss rush mode.

Overall? Pretty good game, definitely my GOTY. Adventure fans this is for you, kinda.
9/10

PC Technical Side:

As a Sega Genesis Kid i always pictured a game like this. They did a great job. Running smooth on my 3090. Very minimal pop in. Must buy for any Sonic Fan.,,
"7,5/10 game.",,
"I wasn't initially that hyped about it, but it turns out Sonic Frontiers is VERY good. To give you an idea, it's been quite a while since I've last played anything for four hours straight in a single sitting (barring short breaks).
Sure, it's clunky in many ways (as is to be expected from a Sonic game) and generally feels a bit too easy in Normal mode, but the overall gameplay flow combined with more open areas works extremely well. There's always something to do, whether it's explore the world, pick stuff up, beat enemies up, play more traditional levels, or just randomly move around the game world wherever the winds (and rails) take you. The soundtrack is also very good and matches the game's vibes (as is to be expected from a Sonic game), even though some tracks are not fully my jam.

Pros:
Excellent gameplay in open areas, but traditional levels are usually pretty fun and well-designed too.
Tonnes of content and things to do and collect. Combined with addictive gameplay, ""one more thing"" is usually not actually just one.
Great and fitting soundtrack, and one of the most extensive to date for the franchise. Also: metal in my mainline Sonic game?! Count me in!
Sound design is also really polished and adds a lot to the atmosphere.
Very good story and character interactions. I haven't played Adventure, but I've been told it gives strongly similar vibes while respecting the series's lore. And many games get referenced...
Absolutely gorgeous visuals for a Sonic game.
Tutorials and challenges in loading times, it's not much but it helps hiding them.

Meh:











Cons:








An excellent and very addictive game with a very ""arcade"" gameplay that I would recommend to newcomers and franchise veterans alike, as long as you can overlook some of its rough edges.



Update: I've finally finished the ""Final Horizon"" DLC, and it pains me to say it, but it's not great. None of the game's updates really are to be fair, but the ""Another Story"" chapter is massive compared to previous ones, so I was hoping it would be quality content. Unfortunately it feels like it lacked playtesting and had too big of a scope for an update, resulting in lots of elements seeming half-baked or unfair.








TL;DR for Another Story: it's quantity over quality. It was probably not playtested well enough, and as a result everything wants to kill you, and the best way to win is not to play. If the base game was a solid 8/10 (as much as I dislike giving scores), this would be a 5/10 at best. Beat the base game, try the DLC, and just drop it if you don't like it; you won't miss out on much aside from some world/lore building, and the alternative ending isn't even canon as far as I'm aware.",,
sonic team make a good sonic game??????? what??????,,
Fun,,
this game is peak,,
Big congrats to Sonic fans for finally getting a game that's just okay,,
The game isn't a masterpiece but it's definitely a lot of fun. There's enough substance here to satisfy all Sonic fans. Plenty of entertaining challenges to complete in the hub world and cyberspace. The fighting combos look beautiful once you get the hang of it. The gameplay is fairly normal on hard mode so I would suggest you avoid any of the easier settings. The future is looking bright for Sonic games.,,
"I believe this game is a huge step forward for the writing of sonic games, with Ian Flynn on the team. Every character feels like themselves instead of talking robots in the the last decade of sonic. The gameplay aspect was also extremely fun for me and I'm sure for many people. It can definitely be improved and I really hope Sonic Team and Sega make another project that builds on the gameplay of this game (combat, physics, open world etc.).

I wish the side story cutcenes were animated a little better but I guess the main story ones were the priority. The final boss fight was... weird, to say the least. probably the weakest part of the game which kinda sucks. But hey that means that most of the game is really fun! Most guardians are really fun to fight, with a few exceptions... I'm looking at you Ghost and Shark. I'm pretty sure every single titan was extremely fun and energetic to fight against so that's good.

Cyberspace levels are short and sweet, and if you're a hardcore sonic fan, you'll recognise some of the level layouts :)

Overall this is def a 9 churros out of 10.",,
"The best Sonic game in over 10 years, and incredible in its own right too. Frontiers did not disappoint, while there are a few small growing pains with the new game-play style, this is an incredible base for a new generation of Sonic games. The story is actually really good too, Flynn definitely got to flex on this project and it shows. The music is amazing (of course), and the open world doesn't feel tacked on or annoying and I never felt like it would be a pain to cross the map, because Sonic can move so fast that you can just schmoove™ your way to wherever you need to go and its fun. The game is really fun. Its got a few issues that could use tidying up, but overall I enjoyed the game and I hope they build on it in the future.

I highly recommend playing High Speed Style, even if you're rusty on Sonic games, the extra oomph and bounce makes exploring feel clean.

SEGA, please let Sonic Team build on this, its good, give them adequate time and they can make good games like this, and maybe make it better too.",,
the closest thing to a direct injection of sonic into your veins,,
sonic is good! the gameplay is good! the writing is good! the music is good! sonic team please do this again but better and don't make lost world 2 instead!!,,
Sonic Frontiers is my favorite sonic game ever I love exploring the open world peacefully it just feels so good and chill.,,
"The game is unplayable due to Denuvo. Constant freezing and crashing. Tried running settings that are far below what is on the Nintendo Switch, but it did not fix the issue. DO NOT BUY.",,
"The Gameplay needed a little time for me to get used to.
It is Modern Sonic, yet a bit different from previous 3D Sonic Games.
Once I knew what I was doing, I had a blast playing this Game!
The story is nicely written, references sometimes even the Adventure Games from the Dreamcast Era and is held pretty mature.
Some Visuals are pretty great, while some others seem to lack the last Touch, but that's not that big of a deal.
To top things off, the OST is simply amazing!
As someone who played every Sonic Game since the OG Sonic from 1991, I can highly recommend this Game!",,
"If not a good game, a redemption for Sonic Team.
even within its flaws, there is a lot to look forward.

don't listen to ""anyone"", play the game yourself :)
- me

it's a 7/10 (in a good way)
waiting for discounts is recommended.",,
"100% the game, its pretty good. I think there's some issues with how the pop-ins come through and a decent amount of jank, but the game is overall the best W sonic fans will get in 11 years. I'm very happy with how this game turned out, it's loads of fun, and it's interactive enough to keep you hooked. If you aren't comfortable with the regular price tag, get it on sale. But if this game ever goes on sale, it's a 100% guaranteed buy. I give it an 8/10.",,
"I never doubted this game. It's not perfect, nothing is, but it's amazing in its own right and is a fresh take on the Sonic franchise, crossing into new territory while also taking snippets from the past games, without overdoing the nostalgia or relying too heavily on older playstyles.

Sonic controls very well, and how he controls can be fine tuned in the options menu in-game; you can change his turn speed, his top speed, his starting speed, etc. The actions all feel smooth, the way you can combo attacks and such feels really REALLY nice. I've yet, personally, to find any issues with how he controls, but will update my review as I deem necessary. I love the skill tree and how much variety there is with the combat.

The environments are gorgeous, sprinkled with plenty to entertain yourself with; aside from all the rains, springs, hoops, dash pads, and all that jazz, just running around a Sonic feels so right. You never seem to go too fast to control, yet you never feel too slow either, and the environment compliments this nicely. There's many branching paths, and you can ignore them all and explore the islands as you desire.

The music, as is the case with every other Sonic title, is outstanding. It's beautiful and calming when it needs to be, bringing a mysterious edge to the world you run in. And when you encounter a baddie, it picks up the tempo accordingly to get your blood pumping. The sound design for everything is beautiful as well, from the subtle sounds Sonic makes to the grass blowing softly in the wind. Even the sounds the little Koco guys make are so cute and well done.

Voice acting is a step up. While I stick to my personal opinion that Ryan D. did Sonic's voice the best, Roger pulls it off VERY well in this game, taking the Sonic voice we got accustomed to for so long and making it feel more mature, while still retaining that Sonic essence it had. The rest of the cast plays their parts VERY well, not much else to say here, but will update if my views change at the ending of the game.

The cyber stages are pretty great for the most part, bringing both visuals and level layouts from various past entries and meshing them together into a bunch of incredibly satisfying breaks from the open world adventures. The controls feel great in these segments too, though they sometimes can feel a bit on the slower side, especially if you're fresh out of the ""boost era"" of games. The music still kicks butt, (my personal fave so far being 1-2's track), though I wish you could disable the sound distortion effect when you boost so you can jam out properly.

The writing is a BIG improvement from the last few titles. I can appreciate some snarky Sonic 'tude, but this game (as of right now at least) does an amazing job balancing serious tones with Sonic's attitude. It's not very dark, but it takes itself seriously enough that the story just feels really captivating and mysterious. It feels almost like another Sonic Adventure game, just lacking other playable characters.

Aside from the menus feeling a bit slow (as in there's sometimes a second of a delay before it lets you confirm certain settings changers) and some of the cyber space levels feeling a tad sluggish as well, my only complaint is the digital deluxe edition itself. I bought it for the artbook, soundtrack, and the cosmetics you can throw onto the blue guy, but I'd love if it'd give an option to NOT take the extra keys or memory tokens and stuff. And a bit more in terms of graphical settings; it caps at 60 fps as of writing this, and it causes screen tearing even WITH v-sync enabled. Uncapped FPS would do wonders for this game.

Overall, I'm glad I bought this game so far, especially the digital deluxe edition. I've never lost faith in the hedgehog, but I know some have. I feel this will bring them back to the franchise. This game deserves to be supported and tried out. It deserves a chance, one that I KNOW you won't regret giving it.

I dunno how to end this. It's nearly 4am and I said what I wanted. Go play this game already!",,
"I'll be honest, I think the game was overhyped. I was really looking forward to this one since I've been a Sonic fan since I was a kid, and I know the rough streak he's had for a while now. Am open world Sonic game sounds like it could've been the perfect thing for him, but once the trailers and stuff started coming out, my feelings about the game started to go south. I was still gonna get it since it's Sonic, but I knew that maybe the game wasn't going to be for me.

Once I started the game, that feeling started to ring true more and more. The open world aspect would've been great, if there was more to do. All you're doing most of the time is just running around big empty areas. Sure there are enemies and obstacles, but that got so repetitive so quickly. The layout of all the rails, springs, and climbable walls is so bad, it feels like the devs just tossed a bunch of blocks on the floor and said ""Yep, that looks good. Put it in the game"". The Cyberspace levels were so bad too, since all feeling of speed is stripped away bc of the Boost not working properly. They were easy to get S Ranks though, so that was nice at least. Weirdly enough, only the 2nd one was really hard. Idk if they did it on purpose to get people to talk about the game online or something.

One thing they emphasized was the combat in the game, but that's another weak point. Lackluster moves that have weird animations when used together. I think Sonic Boom and Spin Slash were pretty much the only ones I even bothered using. Unlocking all the possible moves was too easy as well. You level up way too quickly, and since there aren't that many moves to get, it won't be long until you have Sonic's whole toolkit unlocked.

Speaking of upgrades, leveling up Max Speed and Max Ring Count was such a pain in the ass. I played it before they fixed it in an update, so that's cool.

The fights against the Titans was also a huge letdown. Only the first one was interesting, but that's bc it has to since you need a hook for the player. All the bosses felt clunky and kinda bland. Mashing buttons worked for all of them tbh.

For being a Sonic game, the music was a letdown too. I've always agreed w/ the idea of ""Sonic games may be bad, but at least they have banger music"". That wasn't the case this time, as I can't remember any song aside from the vocal tracks, but that's only bc I'm currently in a phase where i listen to them on YT.

Story progression was a big mess also. Idk how I was supposed to play this game, but as you progress through the island, you come across spots that reveal bits of lore about everything going on. You need a certain number of Memory Tokens to unlock them, so maybe you're meant to unlock those scenes slowly. I didn't do that, lol. Since I saw the requirements, I decided to instead collect all the Memory Tokens on an Island before going and viewing the scenes one after another. This made things feel very scattered, and I feel like the devs should've worked on that part a bit more. The plot was sort of confusing and forgettable as a result of this too.

Just like w/ Sonic Forces, there was no point in having a Normal and Hard mode. I totally forgot I was playing on Hard mode until I got to the end.

I know there was a big update that came out a while ago, but I honestly have no interest in checking it out since none of what was added seems worthwhile.

4/10, bad game that was overhyped. I will continue to wait for the next good Sonic game",,
"Have not played this game alot yet, but i can say thats its the best sonic game to come out in years.
The last one that i enjoyed was sonic unleashed and all the other games were disapointing
i would say with the little bit i experienced i can rate the game an 8/10",,
"This is my favorite Sonic game now without a doubt, while it's not perfect in execution.. you can really tell the amount of love and passion poured into this project despite it's rough edges. With that being said however, I would like to go into the pro's and cons of Sonic Frontiers because like I said, it's nowhere close to being perfect but it's sure one of the best Sonic experiences in my opinion.

Pros:

-Sonic Controls like an absolute dream, he moves as smooth as butter in the open-zone. it's the best feeling control since I wanna say SA1, it always feels like I'm in control of movement.

-The open ended progression system, mandatory collectibles in addition to collectibles used to upgrade Sonic can be obtained in a variety of ways which I appreciate because every play-through can feel fresh.

-The Combat, while simple in design.. feels very flexible and fun to experiment with. Initially I was worried that the combat in the game would be button mashy and to a certain degree it is, but it's really up to you to mix up your strategies in how you take down enemies. Additionally, I love how easily you are allowed to chain combo's together without it ever feeling clunky or slow (a problem with combat in past Sonic games). So to me, this is the best combat system we've had thus far.

-Super Sonic was a real treat, it was an amazing idea to take something that's usually apart of the end game in any other Sonic game to just be apart of each of the Titian battles.

-The music, OH THE MUSIC IS INCREDIBLE AND VERY VARIED. From melancholic melodies in the Open-Zone, to the DNB style of the CyberSpace stages. On top of that, each Titian has each of it's own blood pumping metal track which screams early 2000's and really sells the pure power and scale of each Titan (and to an extent Super Sonic).

-The design of the Open-Zone maps were very fluid to run through and collecting memory tokens were never a hassle, linking together each mini platforming challenge together is very satisfying and fast paced. I never felt lost for the majority of my time with this game, which is something I face in many games that are similar (other open world games like BOTW and GTA V for instance).

-The Story while not much on the surface (in terms of plot beats), contains elements and themes that make it incredible to me. For example, the characterization is a MASSIVE step up from games of past. Sonic and his friends no longer feel like exposition dumps or background character that cheer Sonic on, they actually feel like characters that feel, struggle, and grow like actual people instead of being silly stereotypes with a status quo.


Now onto the cons:

-While I really enjoy the majority of the boss fights (my favorites being Ninja and Spider), there are some that feel a little frustrating to fight.. for example, Asura may look grand in scale and yes it's very ambitious to have a boss of that scale. However, were it falters is within it's mechanics and how unpredictable the collision can be while climbing up Asura's 3 arms leading to you fall off more times than not making the overall fight feel tedious.

-Unlike a lot of people, I actually enjoy Cyberspace... from a level design standpoint that is. I love how they act as special stages and are fun to replay to master each layout (looking at you 1-2) but they simply aren't fun to control, which is jarring when you have such excellent control in the Open-Zone to go to Cyberspace which feels so much stiffer and awkward to control (especially in mid-air). It baffles me that the options allow you to tweak some of Sonic's attributes to your liking in the Open-Zone to then not mean a single thing in Cyberspace.

-Chaos Island is my least favorite island for having a lack of proper direction and splitting up the map into different chunks suspended over a pit didn't help, making me feel a bit lost on where I'm supposed to go. Especially when you need to locate rails to access other chunks of the island. I still quite like this island, but it suffers from issues the other one's do not.

-Elder Koco, that's it.

-Not a fan of the final boss, it felt lackluster and lacked the spectacle and impact you expect from a final boss in a Sonic game. In other words, it was rather anti-climatic.


So yeah that's what I mean by me loving Sonic Frontiers, even though it's a little rough around the edges at points. With that being said, I am absolutely thrilled to see the groundwork Sonic Frontiers creates for future titles. Who knows, maybe a successor or sequel can even surpass Sonic Frontiers, only time will tell!",,
funni hog game good,,
"Very good game with an excellent storyline. I must say that Sega has done a better job for making a game like this. Thank you Team Sonic, for everything.",,
"i tried everything i could to save writing this review for when the final free major update drops, but i just can't bring myself not to recommend this game, even now. what a love letter this was to the series. my personal favorite era of sonic is from around sonic adventure to sonic and the black knight, where sonic team consistently tried new things, and regardless of quality they were always cheesy, interesting, and, above all, full of heart. sonic frontiers isn't a perfect game, its far from it. but from the writing and characterization being the best the series has had since ~2008 not counting the idw comics, the team trying something really fresh and ambitious that's endlessly fun despite the jank, and the constant labor of love with the major free updates, including 3(+?) new playable characters coming later this year, if you have even a mild interest in the series, this one is an easy choice. the final credits song is even directly about this game being the first stepping stone in a significant leap forward and a return to the ambition and heart the series was once known for. its the only triple a release that had a story and experience that brought me to tears in quite some time. like any good piece of art, it isn't for absolutely everyone and it's totally possible it isn't for you, but if it is, you'll be hard pressed to find something else this passively fun to even just think about. banger game",,
"tl;dr: As a 3D platformer, it's great. As an open-world game, it's one of the very best. Story, voice-acting, music, and diversity of gameplay are all unexpected highlights. If you want a compelling adventure that leans on Sonic's excellent platforming mechanics to tie everything together, get this game.

Sonic Frontiers is less of an open-world Sonic game, and more of a Sonic open-world game. The distinction is important, and will flavor your perception of the game as you go in.

To explain, it feels like the development team started out with a premise such as a Yakuza game, and then made it a Sonic game. In other words, there is no single strong gameplay loop to focus on; instead, this game has a huge variety of side activities and distinct gameplay loops to engage with - or not - at your discretion.

As an open-world game, Sonic Frontiers is an incredible breath of fresh air. Whereas most open-world games lock important features, gear, etc., behind quests you might just not feel like doing, to try to obligate you to do them (thus betraying the open-world do-what-you-want premise), Sonic Frontiers really DOES let you avoid content you don't enjoy in favor of what you do, no fuss. For any given objective, there are many ways to accomplish it, and you're never required to do anything potentially boring for any significant length of time to see all of the story content.

In addition to this unparalleled freedom, Sonic Frontiers benefits from being incredibly fast. That may sound obvious, but you'd be shocked how much more fun an open-world game is when you can get around near-instantly. Also, Sonic is just inherently fun to control in the open world, and that counts for a LOT. Optional platforming and combat challenges are available all over the world, so you can jump in and out of that gameplay loop at any time if you feel even slightly unengaged for more than a second, too.

The story is well-written, the characters are charming, and things feel consistent and fleshed-out. Everything is given enough time to breathe and set in, and little touches like how Sonic idles and behaves at different times in the story tie in very well. Moreover, you aren't bombarded with sidequests that betray the tone; story scenes are always clearly set against the gravity of the current situation, so that even when the tone is light or jovial, the premise is never betrayed (a major problem with Please-Fetch-My-Chickens-While-The-Apocalypse-Is-Happening types of sidequests in many other games). It all feels very consistent and well-thought-out.

The open world also has a significant amount of deliberate sequence-breaking potential. You can launch yourself off of ramps or flat surfaces - or, more significantly, rails during a grind - to avoid the normal drag experienced when jumping and maintain full speed in the air. Used cleverly, this can launch Sonic straight to places that are meant to be much harder to reach. This harkens straight back to Super Metroid and Mario 64 gameplay concepts, and it hits great here.

The game also has huge modding potential, and the modding community has already rolled out mods that range from simple aesthetic swaps to radical physics and combat overhauls. If the core gameplay concepts don't hit right for you, they can be trivially altered, giving the game serious longevity and wider appeal. It also has an unprecedented level of customization in its controls and even its physics in-game, so you can tweak things to work exactly the way you want.

Reaching 100% in this game took me about 36 hours. I didn't have to do any tedious grinding to do so, and I wasn't dragging my feet, so that seems like a fairly safe estimate of the game's runtime. Despite the game's incredibly fast pace, it doesn't fail to hit a respectable open-world-game length. If the name 'Sonic Adventure' wasn't taken, I have a strong suspicion this game would have taken that title.

So as an open world game, this is a triumph. What about as a Sonic game?

Well, the controls in the open world feel pretty great, but the controls in the cyber stages are deliberately rougher to make for a higher challenge. They're meant to be imposing, tough, and feel slightly off compared to reality - and it works. The result is fun, but never loses that 'this doesn't sit right' edge, which I feel works to their benefit more than their detriment since they make up a fairly small slice of the runtime. At no point does this game try to beat previous titles such as Generations at their core gameplay loop, so if you're looking for a pure evolution on the Sonic formula, you won't find it - you'll just find a competent, if slightly odd, variant. The real draw here is the revolution that is putting the game into an open-world context and pairing it with so many disparate gameplay loops.

I'd be remiss not to mention the fantastic boss battles or the masterful music score. These are both great highlights of the game - everything from the moody, subdued tracks of the overworld that carefully match the tone of the story at a given moment to the powerful, unforgettable boss tracks is implemented with care and style. The voice acting is great here as well - Robotnik in particular has some lines, especially towards the end, that resonate with emotion.

Frontiers is a wild ride. Games like this don't come along often - I highly recommend giving this one your time.",,
"Product received for free

banger soundtrack makes up for the wonky physics

8/10",,
"The boss fights are awesome. Otherwise, feels like I'm experiencing mass psychosis.

Sonic is not fun to control. 90% of all levels, mini or otherwise, is rail grinding. The other 10% is fighting against the unbelievably stiff and precise Sonic to get where you want. The attempt at combat is appreciated, however not nearly fleshed out enough to be super fun. There is the occasional good level, but they are few and far between. I let out an audible sigh where an entire Cyberspace area was drifting - why doesn't it have a dedicated button? They obviously want to keep the boost, what was wrong with the Unleashed/Generations style?

The cutscenes and story direction is super jarring, callbacks to old games is cool but not enough to keep a narrative afloat. Not like Sonic is known for it's stories, but still.

Best Sonic game since Generations? Sure - but that's not really saying much. Really not sure what people are seeing here...",,
"Boss fights were utterly epic. Had chills down the spine especially while listening to the cyberspace jammer. They've also added the possibility to draw an Among Us pattern with the cyloop, which is a cool reference in my opinion. Overall, i'd say pretty cool game. Really wished they could've added Tails Doll though.",,
"Wyvern fight, music, camera angles, mechanics, the scenic view, just wow. Successfully lets you reflect on your childhood with fondness for a blue rat. Also, open ZONE stuff was pleasantly not a huge chore. End left a lot to be desired, but free dlc stuff coming over next year.",,
"A good, modern Sonic game?

Introduction

There have been numerous hit and miss Sonic games over the years. Sonic Frontiers aims to take the series in a new direction by implementing an open-world for Sonic to traverse. So how does the game hold up?


The game has a static title screen with different options to adjust camera speed, running speed, turning speed, inverting controls and several graphics settings. There are multiple language options too and voices can be in English or Japanese. Numerous cutscenes are also peppered throughout the game to progress the story.


Graphically the game looks very nice with a huge, sprawling, open-world to explore. It does evoke Breath of the Wild in many aspects. Character models are quite basic (as you'd expect from the cast of Sonic) but look nice overall. Whilst the backgrounds look great with large, open areas and nice-looking building structures throughout, there is an alarming amount of pop-in present throughout the whole game. I'm not sure if this is due to poor programming or limitation of the custom hedgehog engine that they used but it is definitely distracting. It can also be detrimental when you are looking for paths to different areas of the map but can't see them until you get close enough. I'm hoping that Sega can fix this with a patch but the game was delayed by a year and they still left a big issue like this in the game? This leads me to believe that perhaps we won't get a fix at all. The game runs at 60 fps but unfortunately there is no way of uncapping the framerate. I did notice some rare fps drops but nothing major.


Voice acting sounds like other Sonic games and would fit in a cartoon. Sounds effects are very good overall. It's a Sonic game so music is great.


So the bulk of the game is spent in the open-world areas which is broken up into different islands. Being able to zoom around at supersonic speeds in open space really feels like you get to fully unleash Sonic and make the most of his abilites. No longer are you hampered by the limitations of previous games. If you have played or seen any of the numerous 3D open-world Sonic fangames or tech demos then this may already be familiar to you.

You unlock portions of the island map as you progress by completing numerous challenges on each island, most of which are rudimentary puzzles. Each map features several portals that link to traditional 2D or 3D Sonic stages that will be familiar to series vets. Completing these traditional stages grants Sonic keys which are used to unlock access to Chaos Emeralds. Collect all the Emeralds on an island to progress through the game. There are also several mini-bosses sprinkled about the island along with other smaller enemies. Other than that there are collectibles littered about the game that can level up Sonic's stats as well as allow him to unlock new moves for combat. You start off with only a couple of basic moves but once you unlock more then combat really starts to shine and being able to do different combinations of Sonic's moves to take out enemies really starts to feel satisfying.

Along with levelling up Sonic's power and defense you are able to increase the number of rings he can carry as well as his speed but unlike his power and defense, you can only increase the these stats one level at a time by collecting small creatures called Koco and exchanging them. If you want to increase your stats by 30 levels for example (there are 99 in total) then you'll be there for ages. They should have implemented a faster and more efficient way of doing this as it just wastes valuable time.

Each island has a fishing spot featuring Big the Cat that features a far more relaxing fishing minigame that is quite fun and breaks up the action. You can also unlock Dr. Eggman audio files in here that build on the story. The narrative moves the action forward and whilst it isn't a masterpiece by any means it is probably the best written Sonic game I've played from memory.

The camera can sometimes work against you in this game and sometimes you can't manually adjust it when you need to which can be a little irritating when you need to do some precision platforming or an enemy is off-screen.

There are 4 bosses in the game (known as Titans) that you will battle as Super Sonic. They are the usual epic Sonic boss battles that you've grown accustomed to. One gripe is that you cannot battle them again after completing the game (other than by loading up old saves). Sega should add in an option in the main menu at least. If you opt to finish the game on hard difficulty then there is .


So overall Sonic Frontiers is a successful new direction for the series and definitely one of the best (if not the best) 3D Sonic games I've ever played. Most of all it feels refreshing whilst still paying respect to Sonic's origins. The technical issues do hinder the experience and I can only hope that they are addressed going forward. They do sadly make the game feel a bit unpolished.

Sega have the blueprints of a great game here and if they can refine and build upon what they have here for the next one then the drought of good Sonic games could be over.",,
"Best character writing in years, great level design, amazing soundtrack. Would recommend.

Maybe wait until some of the free updates.",,
I dunno where sonic team been hiding this but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ they need to do it more,,
I went fast,,
Play the game it's good,,
Blue hedgehog runs fast. Good soundtrack. Very Game.,,
Gotta Go Fast,,
Easily the best 3D Sonic game in the last 15 years. Everything I've ever wanted.,,
sonic fartiers xd,,
"Not mind blowing or genre redefining by any stretch, but it's a consistently fun (and functional) Sonic adventure with a satisfying feedback loop and excellent characterization. More Mario Odyssey than Breath of the Wild. It's exactly what Sonic needed.",,
"honestly its a good step in the right direction. Like sure there are some bad things about the game like wonky camera, weird bits of terrain that make you launch off the ground, and the most boring fishing mini game known to man. but hey stuff like that can be ironed out and improved in a future game. All and all a really good step forward for the game and I hope it gets improved.",,
Can't believe this soundtrack came with a free game.,,
Sonic :),,
This is the best 7/10 game ever made,,
I had fun playing this video game,,
just fun,,
"An 8/10 game. Best mainline Sonic in over 10 years. Had a lot of fun with this one. Sure, there are some flaws, but in my opinion, Sonic is truly back. Can't wait to see how the open zone formula will improve.",,
"Finally a good 3d Sonic game since Generations.

The story is good, nothing breathtaking, but Ian's writing really made it enjoyable.

Sonic's moveset is really cool, the combat is nice and overall the enemies are fun to fight, especially the guardians (obviously it's not DMC or Bayonetta lmao). The Titan boss fights are so hype, Super Sonic is cool again :D

The island designs are bland, seeming uninspired with objects and tracks that don't blend well with the environment, although I still enjoy running around and discovering new routes.

The puzzles in the open area are easy, sometimes a little too easy even on hard mode, but they are quite fun to play.

The cyberspace levels are... fun, the physics are a bit wonky there, but overall they're fun. I don't really like having only 4 themes (Green Hill, Chemical Plant, Sky Sanctuary and a city level), I was hoping for more returning level themes but we got the same overused Sonic levels.

The music here is really good, love the diversity in the soundtrack: the open zone has a sad and mysterious vibe, cyberspace has EDM and drumm 'n bass, and the Titan fights have ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Metalcore. The game also has 3 ending songs, Vandalize a licensed song by One Ok Rock, One Way Dream by NateWantsToBattle and Dear Father by Quinn Barnitt, the last one hits hard after the ending.

In the end, yes I really like it. For me it's a 80/100, really a good start for the new era.

sorry if it's hard to read, it's my first serious review :D.",,
"So... Do i recommend it ? it's complicated.
This game is going into the right direction, be it in story telling, ideas, ect but it obviously has some flaws.

I used thumbs up to use as a general statistic so SEGA sees that it was good step to take.

TL;DR It's a good game, with obvious flaws. if you can wait for a sale get it then instead of full price, otherwise pay full price at your own risks.
Keep reading if you don't care for minor spoilers and can bear to read my not so good english.

I'll try to make it short, but ... i have many thing i can say.
Not talking about the technical stuff as it's obvious and many other already covered it

Gameplay is overall actually fun ! it is really hard to show it, you'd have to play it yourself to get a feeling for it.

As soon as i hit a new area, exploring was for me the most fun. Seing new stuff, fighting new enemy types.
The cyberspace levels (AkA more classic level design part of the game) despite having kinda clunky and stiff physics were a nice addition, although it is a bit too easy for my taste to hit the different mission goals in them. I had more than 15 sec over S rank in some levels while also having done some very sub-optimal moves to get red rings.

A bit more into open world stuff :
For me the islands could have been more Sonic like designs that you would see in some fan games, it would open it more to momentum based gameplay which sadly heavily lacks to my taste. Jumping kills all your speed, you can go from 0 to 100 with a button press and instantly stop aswell, it plays fine, but feels unnatural to say the least.
On the + side, all mechanics and combat are balanced with these physics in mind so you'll be able to smoothly get through all of the game. I just wish SEGA would be more inclined to let players experiment, fail, and retry instead of holding our hands all the time with scripted sections. Ironically, whenever i did fail at some jumping or so on a scripted section, i felt like it was the game's fault for suddenly changing the camera, or expecting me to do something just after a 10 sec automated section where i was just holding forward.

Speaking about scripted sections : There are too much of them IMO. They're quite fun at first and some are actually really well done, but 1 island in particular has so many 2D forced section that it made me try to avoid any boost or jump pad as long as i didn't need it to get somewhere specific. If i didn't avoid them, i might have been stuck in it until i complete it or find a breaking point like failing a jumping part on purpose to get my 3D movement freedom back again.
For me, getting somewhere would be more fun if i had to look at my surroundings, find a suitable path and get there myself with whatever movement options i'm confortable using in that situation instead of finding a jump pad that leads to a rail with a few more or less quick reaction button presses.

Now for combat :
Compared to any Sonic game, it is quite a step up. You have basic moves, some combos you will unlock 1 by 1, dodges and ... parry. you can also use basic jumping, stomp, slide and drop dash to damage enemies but it's not very pratical. Some enemies have specific needs on how to be defeated, be it with the new overal tool, Cycloop, or them having their own parry so you need to get behind them or stagger them so you can damage them. Then there are mini bosses that have their own gimmicks, and the bosses which are a really cool spectacle, especially with the music that plays.
A nitpick would be that the homing attack is the same button as the attack button, so it can happen that you just wanna smack an enemy to finish it off, but the homing attack gets triggered by another ennemy next to it instead. Also, parry has no timing or facing requirements, so you can just stay there with your parry up waiting for an attack without any risks. Also also, using parry in the air will make you float infinitely as long as you hold the parry. It has no benefit, but hey i laughed when i saw it !

Exploring :
I said it was for me the most fun part. But this part also sadly gets SEGA's handheld treatment, although you don't have access to a full map at the beginning, each part that is revealed through chalenges fully shows whatever there is to get there even without you needing to have been close to it (with the exeptions on purple coins) which usually includes another challenge which will in turn reveals more of the map and so on.
The only benefit to exploring outside of key items is finding more collectibles which i'll talk a bit more later.

Progression :
Progression is pretty good and balanced overall. Combat gets tougher, but you also find stuff to make you stronger : EXP to get new moves, and 2 types of seeds that you can find from doing challenges or exploring, that will increase your attack or defense when interracting with an NPC. For me, as i'm usually trying to find every little thing i can find on the way to the next major objective, it felt like i was slightly getting stronger compared to the bad boys in terms or raw numbers. A normal combo started doing more damage to their overall HP than when i encountered a similar enemy on the last island which makes sense as i was getting a lot of these seeds due to my way of playing. But overall, as i got used to the combat system, i had way more flow and combats were getting faster and faster which was very satisfying.
But fishing is overpowered. i can't elaborate much cause of character limits but here is my advice :
Go fish, it's actually nice, but don't buy the seeds of power attack and defense if you're not really struggling with combat, or you're gonna easily kill big bosses in less than a min.

Small nitpicks :
- Too many mini cutscenes and forced camera positions that break the flow of the game imho.
- Mouse camera control -which i would prefer over a controller in any 3D platforming- is not how you would expect thus making it not really usable, and Cyberspace levels outright disable camera controls, so your typical way of controlling a character with MnK by using your mouse to change the camera's rotation and pressing forward isn't possible.
- the bosses have a bit too much spectacle compared to technical gameplay for my taste
- no post game. You can only go back to your save right beofre the final boss, implying no free roaming Super Sonic :(

What i really liked :
- Although lacking momentum, not being tied by a closed level and just running around was very fun.
- the overall moods of the game are nice : chill music for exploring. Faster paced music for the reaction based type of gameplay for cyberspace, and epic metal songs for the bosses. i don't regret my now almost 30 hours on it.
- Although i seem to contradict myself, the bosses spectacle is really nice ! They just lack a bit of technical combat to feel really satisfying, but that's coming from a monster hunter player.
- There are 4 big bosses. Not only the typical one and only last big boss we're used in Sonic games.
- While the story is pretty basic, it's well written. I especially liked the characters interaction with each others. It doesn't add much to the actuall story itself, but it is finally some character building. It was nice to see some actual things friends would do instead of only a goofy speech at the end to promote the power of friendship.


On a side note : the very active mod community already released some mods that actually adress some issues i have with the game like the adding momentum based movement and some cutscene related stuff, so in the future we can expect to get nice things to extend the life of the game.

So.. if you read through all that, well thanks i guess ? And i hope it helps anyone to make a choice. First time i ever took time to make an actual review so feel free to comment on it if you wish so.",,
"I’ve been an Sonic Fan since the release of Sonic Adventure on the Dreamcast back in the 90’s. This game brought me back to those years when I saw Sonic rooming at speeds that made me in love with the franchise in the first place. That being said, here’s what you need to know before playing the game:

•The game is an Open World adventure where you can go to any point on the map and complete objectives at your leisure’s (unless plot driven)

•Sonic as character progress as you discover and obtain the items in the game where a bit an RPG element is inspired

•The speed of Sonic is represented by how you can handle fast movement and control his path which is player based

•There’s a lot going on from the Starfall events, fishing portals, obstacles, terrain exploration, enemies, and so on

•Sonic Frontiers soundtrack is a BANGER as it always has been throughout the whole franchise. You’re enjoy listening to all sounds in the game especially with headphones

Sonic Frontiers is a great casual and speedrunning game that I enjoyed completing 100% in under 40 hours and I recommend this game for old and new players.

Sonic Adventure meets Open World 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏",,
"Sonic just works so well in an open world sandbox. Had an absolute blast exploring the maps and very much enjoyed the more serious take on a story! Also loved how much care was put into the fan service, from addressing character quirks over the past several games to mentions of Sonic's past adventures. This game felt like a love letter to everyone concerned about modern Sonic's direction, and I'm here for it. I can't wait for Sonic's next big adventure.",,
the part where sonic went frontier mode was insane,,
"Loved It, it was worth every single hour I spent on the game, and now I'm obsessed with Sage. 9/10",,
"Love this game, and I love Sonic",,
Sonic's back,,
The best game overall that I have played in a long time! Usually modern games as a whole have been quite disappointing nowadays but playing this has been a highlight in my gaming experience. I wonder if any DLC will be released for this game other than cosmetics? Looking forward to finding out!,,
"Sonic's back baby. I've beaten the game on both console and PC now, and I'm still ready to go back for a third playthrough. SEGA have managed to fuse their arcade'y game design roots with modern open world trends in a completely unique fashion. I've never wanted to speedrun an open world game, but I'm already loving blasting through these environments with shortcuts and hidden routes, and using Sonic's momentum to keep up a consistent flow. There's definitely a bit of jank in here and the reused levels from Generations, Unleashed and SA2 are a bit of a shame; but none of that compromises how fun the game feels to play. If this is the Sonic 1 of this new open zone formula, I can't wait to see what the Sonic 2 of it will be.

The story is a huge return to form for the series, and marks the first time since Sonic and the Black Knight that these characters have really felt like themselves (outside of the comics...) and a huge reason for that is Ian Flynn coming from his decade and a half of experience writing the comics to finally be given the opportunity to contribute to the games.

Also this games' soundtrack is unbelievably good. 'Undefeatable' is going to be some 10 year olds' musical awakening. All of the titan battles are clearly inspired by Metal Gear Rising and I'm all here for it.",,
"Open Zone is a winning format.

Sega realized this in 1998, but didn't have the hardware to really make it as expansive. Instead of abandoning their ideas, they've finally created a proper successor in game play to the original Sonic Adventure.

Cyberspace levels are rough around the edges at first, but if you're willing to put the time into them they're the single most satisfying 3D sonic stages ever crafted. Despite most of the level layouts being reused from previous games, the new engine and slight re-imaginings turn these stages into something truly special; and they're not even the main course!

The new writing team certainly had their hands full catching up with 20 years of left-behind lore, but they somehow stitched everything together in a way that works! The Sonic franchise is finally cohesive again.

...Except for the ending, lol!

The gameplay is unique, the soundtrack is the best in the series, and overall I'm incredibly impressed by a sonic release for the first time in my life.

PLEASE KEEP THIS FORMULA

IT WORKS!!!!!!",,
"One of the times I think Steam needs a mixed review option. The game was fun, however it left me feeling unfulfilled. It's a step in the right direction for the sonic franchise. Pretty sure SEGA looked at people beating Sonic Forces in 2 hours and thought 'What if we made it so it takes 2 hours to progress one part of the story through collectables'. TLDR; not a bad game, just a kinda there and got me through a couple of days game.",,
"TL;DR I am very satisfied with this game as an old Sonic fan. Long gone is my shattered heart from the unforgettable Sonic Forces hype...

Gameplay
The Open Zone kills it. Admittedly, its design with random platforms, rails, bumpers and dash panels isn't the greatest but what saves it is the sense of exploration you get from each island. The challenges that unlock the map are piss easy but that doesn't make them annoying. They are bite sized, small distractions from all the running and jumping around. The physics are great and the drop dash from Sonic Mania is in a 3D Sonic game for the first time! You can get some amazing momentum rolling down hills and can gain lots of height jumping after boosting on an incline or a rail.

Cyber Space... Bad physics. Most of the levels are bad. The ones that copy their level designs from SA1, SA2 and Unleashed are very fun. But yeah... The physics are bad. You can fix them with mods but they break some stuff with the game, so I do not recommend doing that.

There are some stupid mini-games in the main story quests. Sheep herding... And the worst: On the 3rd island, there's a bridge you cannot jump across, there's an invisible wall. Later on in the story, Sonic jumps through the bridge in a cutscene while jumping . And you have to get him to the ground . I hate arbitrary time-limits. Stupid mini-games like these should exist in the main story.

Elder Koco leveling takes way too long, just like Hestu from BOTW. I spent an hour pressing menu buttons and waiting through unskippable animations and text just to get my speed and ring capacity to the max level. Hermit Koco is better, he just levels your ATK and DEF at the same time while using all your resources. Why doesn't this also exist for Elder Koco? I have no idea.

The final boss, even the true one which you only get if you play on Hard mode, is a joke. The true final boss comes out of nowhere and is a very, very big disappointment. Regular bosses in this game are more like the final bosses you'd expect from Sonic games.



The narrative. Oh the narrative. God bless you Ian Flynn. We finally have a serious and comprehensive Sonic story after years of junk and especially after the disappointment that was Sonic Forces, I am very happy with this one. Expect callbacks, direct references and actual story connections to past Sonic media, including but not limited to Sonic 3, Sonic Adventure 1 and Sonic Adventure 2. The dialogues and writing are also amazing, Flynn definitely knows how to write the characters and playfully dances around their personalities, thoughts and dreams. There are some unexplained stuff in the game which I think they are saving for a future title. We'll see.

This is a weird one. While the game looks outstanding there is an insane amount of pop-in and you have no way to fix it. There are 30 and 60 FPS caps for the game and while you can unlock the framerate using Cheat Engine, it breaks certain aspects of the game, so I do not recommend doing that at all. All cutscenes are locked at 30 FPS. Besides the pop-in everything looks gorgeous at High settings. I cannot comment on the Low settings but I'd assume it'd look similar to the Switch version, which I find very ugly. I don't think the game is very demanding at High settings, as long as you have a decent system you shouldn't have any issues running it at 1080p 60 FPS.

I still don't like Roger's Sonic voice, even with this serious direction but many of the voice actors do a great job. They fit the tone of the game perfectly while not feeling too forced or cheesy. And while I don't like Roger as Sonic at all, I can't really imagine this story with Jason's voice either... But it is what it is. He does a great job and improves throughout the game. He starts sounding better as the game progresses, so maybe there were some issues when recording for the game first started.

The Open Zone musics are amazing. Some Cyber Space tracks are amazing. Most are subpar and forgettable. Boss musics are epic, except, again, the final boss. I have no idea why they thought that final boss was a good idea.

In my opinion, this is an amazing step in the right direction for Sonic. I finished it 100% in 26.5 hours without rushing. I hope they try at least one more game with this formula and improve upon it. Even zooming around the Open Zone mindlessly is fun, movement is fluid, it's just great. Very excited for the future.",,
"Updated Review on Sonic frontiers

Overall this is the best sonic game that we've ever had in a while. However what I listed on top before hand with my other review that I had problems with the game itself, became more and more problematic and that it wouldnt allow me to progress further in the game.


Overall the mechanics were repetative, and that it was becoming a chore, and also just time consuming to the point it was frustrating.


I LOVED THIS GAME, however the tasks that you had to do to progress were not so great.",,
Sometimes I lay awake at night thinking about how lucky I am to be born in a world where Sonic Frontiers exists.,,
"Not sonic unleashed, but still a good glimpse of what sonic forces could've been if they polished it a little more, cyberspace isn't much of a challenge but it's still a fun experience",,
"It feels surreal to be able to enjoy a Sonic game fair and square instead of it being a guilty pleasure.

Great job Sonic Team, you finally found a formula to build upon!",,
"Truly a great experience, has its ups and downs, nothing bad really, expected maybe a little bit more, but surely made me so happy the time i spent exploring the islands, S ranking the levels, finding the tokens, and specialy going through the dialoges with the characters and being surprised time and time again with the on going interactions and developments.

I am truly happy, satisfied and most of all exited for whats to come for the future of Sonic The Hedgehog, as long as it keeps the talented and great people that love the franchise working on it.",,
"This is by far the best Sonic game I've played in 3D. A solid 17 hours of gameplay was needed for me to complete the main storyline and progress to to the final battle. There's still lots more to do after completing the main story. I wonder how much more time I can spend till I hit 100% completion.
P.s. Each world brings new and or upgraded mechanices and enemies, along side more robots, bosses and epic fights",,
"Good game and a step in the right direction for the Sonic series. It could use a lot of adjustments to make this go from a good to a perfect game, like better designing the open-zone area to feeling more Sonic-y style than like any other open world game. Hopefully there will be big improvements on the next release.",,
"Easily one of the best Sonic games to date, honestly even rivals how much I love Adventure. The story is great, the gameplay is smooth, and although I was originally skeptical about it, the combat feels awesome. The only issues I really have are small nitpicks about the cyber realm stages and some other small things, but overall they didn't bother me too much.",,
"Easily the best 3D Sonic game I've played. The story is amazing and the gameplay matches to boot. It just feels fun to run around the islands with no real goal in mind. The weakest part of the game is Cyberspace but the story at least gives context to *why* it's a reuse of assets from previous games. At least they mix it up a bit by having some level geometry from games past, which is a rewarding sight for ultra Sonic nerds like myself. The physics in Cyberspace feel slightly off compared to the open zone segments, but that's just a nitpick on my part. I fully reccomend Sonic fans and maybe even a few non-sonic fans to give this game a try. There's much in store, especially for those who have been around the hedgehog for a long while.",,
"Don't normally review games on here, but this one is definitely personal. I've been a Sonic fan for 19 years now, and I can still visualize that exact moment I first got to play a Sonic game. Now, I started with Sonic Adventure 2 Battle on the Gamecube, which to be fair spoiled me hard, but I spent so many years of my life playing that game and still do to this very day. It, along with the rest of this franchise is special to me in more ways than I can describe.

So, to be with the franchise through so many ups and downs, let me tell you, Sonic Frontiers feels rewarding. Very very rewarding. Finally, a Sonic game has come out again and it's just good. Call me biased all you want for not being hard on the game for the graphics or pop ins, but to me, this game has a focus on just being fun, and fun it clearly is. And that's how Sonic's needed to be for such a long time. There's so much creativity packed into this game and it never feels like there's a dull moment. You run into so many little things that you can interact with while still moving at full speed, so the pace is always being kept.

AND THEN THE CHARACTERS THEMSELVES, FINALLY! Everyone sounds and acts so much more mature, and they all feel so much more genuine, probably more than they ever have. It's a level of character writing that we haven't seen since Unleashed, but then it's still even better than that. It shouldn't be such a wild thing to go ""Wow, Sonic's not just being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and cracking jokes every line"", like, there's genuine thought behind a lot of things he says in this game, and that's not something I feel you can say about Sonic in a lot of games.

All in all, this is a great return to form for the blue blur. It's exciting to think about where the franchise goes from here, but also a little nerve-wrecking considering they actually have a good game to follow up now lmao. Time will tell how it goes, but for now, I'm just happy we got this game.",,
"I just finished this game so it's fresh on my mind still. As a Sonic series veteran, I've seen many highs and many lows. The past decade has been mostly unkind to the blue hedgehog but... This is phenomenal. The gameplay, the story, the music, all of it... It's all great. This is the most enjoyment I've gotten out of a Sonic game in a really long time. To avoid gushing any further, I'm just going to list a few pros and cons that stood out to me.

Pros
- Genuinely well written, might even be the best Sonic plotline we've ever gotten
- Characters show emotion for once, and Roger finally sounds good as Sonic because of it
- Islands are fun to explore, plenty of little things to keep you busy
- Music is good (As is the usual for Sonic games)
- Combat is surprisingly fun
- Cutscenes and Boss fights are absolutely RAW

- Cyberspace stages can often feel like an afterthought. Some are straight copies of Generations levels. That said, there are a decent amount of fun ones and they don't detract too much from the main experience.
- Turning Sonic during a jump can prove to be a bit of a challenge in smaller areas, but otherwise movement generally feels nice.

-
- Denuvo. I won't get into it but it's purely a bad thing. Doesn't really affect the general game experience though.
- There isn't more to play and I'm sad

If by some miracle you've made it to the end of this review, then thank you for reading. If you haven't already, I implore you to buy this game. This is the first Sonic game in a good while that actually lived up to the hype. Please give it a try. Don't write it off because it's a Sonic game.",,
"The best Sonic has been for a long, long time.",,
very cool,,
"-- INTRODUCTION --
Sonic Frontiers is not just a improvement over Sonic Forces but it succeeds to beat the liking of most of the Boost area games from the last decade.

The good boost games, only regarding the base boost machanic, like Unleashed, Colours and Generation have a better overall feel for what they were designed for and are far superior to the Cyberspace levels in any way possible but they are either way too short or highly inconsistent like Colours and Unleashed.

Sonic Frontiers succeeds at staying consistent but is not affraid to try out new ideas like puzzles, tiny 2D sections in the open world and the very dumb but amazingly fun fishing game.

-- NEGATIVE --
(nothing insulting, just opinions and facts but keep reading, the positive stuff is overwhelming)

**Development and Bugs**
Knowing that Sega always pushes out their games even before they are done makes this game even more of a miracle, I mean 5 years of development! - that is highly unusual. Though, Sega being Sega, they still pushed out the game with many bugs, nothing game breaking but just tiny annoyences like loading erros, objects just appearing(pop in), frame drops, collision errors etc.

**Gameplay**
It is quite hard to know where you are on the island since every part looks pretty much the same, even while using the map you get disorianted easily.
The fourth island felt a little lazy and was part of the first island, so nothing new which was a little dissapointing, other than that, Cyberspace was a fun distraction but controlled poorly and I kept boosting of stage when trying to correct myself, the same applies while gliding down from the sky, it sucked to control.
Titan fights were awesome but very easy to break in a way where you just knew you were fighting a 3D model with animations and some code.
I was very enraged by tiny stone plates on the ground which cancled out my Cyloop and made Sonic flicker/jitter around.

**Story**
!!PLAY WITH SUBTITLES, I MISSED THE WHOLE ANCIENT PLOT!!
There were quite a few story inconsistencies towards the end, but I doubt that this was writer Ian Flynn's fault but more so what he was given by Sonic Team. Every island has these Story moments when you collect memory tokens but the last one could've given Sage and Sonic more moments together which was the weakest island story beat wise, Sage had a great development all the way trough but got cut off a little at the end. (Also I never knew that this giant moon thing was coming and I was a little confused by the whole end sequence and we never found out who the speaking voice was for Sonic or I probably just missed it, either way, something that could've been improved.)


-- POSITIVE --

**Gameplay**
Sonic Frontiers, like the Adventure Series, has tiny games everywhere (not talking about the puzzles).
From Pinball to collecting Scraps, Gardening or Fishing, it's all here! Of course, games that use Sonic's character controller do suffer from the same issues like other parts of the game but it all feels consistent which is the most important thing.

Running trough the open world felt great, having these tiny gameplay functions like infinite boost or the very fast boost felt awesome, need to go somewhere quick? Fill up your rings with cyloop and you are good to go!

Puzzles were a great way to update your map, I even prefer it over the towers in BotW. Sidestep puzzles, run from A to B and so much more, it felt awesome!

The combat was not as button mashy as I expected, it actually felt like something I had to think about the further I progressed and required skill for certain mini boss type enemies which, trust me, were not easy but not in a unfair way but rather in a way that intrigued me to keep trying and not give up!

Running on these Green/Blue/Rainbowish walls is just *chefs kiss*, that was the only part I enjoyed about Lost World back then but it is truly made for this game to move around the enviroment.

The Super Sonic sections felt nice, maybe a little too easy but still quite nice. They were beautifully composed with visual flair and made you not just feel but know that you are about to whoop this Titan's ass.

I have more to say but let us move on.

**Visuals**
Beautiful, I was so worried back in Summer 2022 about the visuals but Sonic Team proved us that they knew what they were doing. They are using the Quixel libary, which are scans of realworld textures. Making something look nice using Quixel is quite hard since it still depends on good lighting, Sonic Team put in 110% to get the best out of lighting to make the textures feel integrated and it really worked out for them. Day and night cycles work great, the new character designs are also breathtaking.
Particle and VFX are also a great improvement to what came before.
There is more to be said but I will leave it as is for now.

*Story*
Finally! Sonic is not a jerkward anymore, he is back to being a occasionally joking but yet a well meaning friend like in Sonic06 and Unleashed. If Sonic would have to leave someone behind for a greater purpose, Sonic wouldn't care, he would go trough all the trouble in the world, saving/helping each and everyone because this is what he knows is right, he fights against all odds, no matter what.

Sonic's relationship with Knuckles is great, they respect each other and apreciate what both did in the past, jokingly testing who is better at starring to then break out in laughter. Sonic even stops Knuckles from attacking Sage but instead of Knuckles getting angry, he trusts Sonic to know what he is doing.

For once they don't fall back to, Tails - Scared but Smart, Amy - THE Sonic Fangirl, Knuckles - Brain AFK/Agressive and Eggman - acting so smart yet so stupid, all of them grow far beyond from what they were the last 12 years and this is great.

Sage is very. and I mean very well written, that is all I will say since I don't want to spoil anyone.

From occasional references to past games, locations and characters, Sonic Frontiers has it all, it even attempts to make the overall lore of the games coherent.

Great job Ian, great job!


-- What now? --

Sega, if you see this, please keep giving your team the time and for god sake, keep Ian Flynn, he knows what he is doing. Make your games and make them make sense, make them longer again like now, keep game testing, it really helps you guys and trust me, we Sonic fans are able to wait another five years and are willing to wait even longer if needed.

This game is a 8/10 for me.
It has issues and bugs but even now, Sonic Team is still gathering and working to fix them.
100% recommended even if you don't care about Sonic.",,
Finally..... After a whole ass decade. Sega actually made a good sonic game that I don't regret spending full price on. I like this framework and hope they build upon this new style in future games.,,
you can fish with big,,
"Good game, some bugs and cyberspace controls are weird and some of the air physics are weird. other than that I give this a MegaStrimp out of 10",,
"Game gud, sonic, sonic good",,
Sonic is back,,
Blue rat go fast :),,
"Honestly a huge step up from previous sonic games, the moment you embrace the open zones as giant playgrounds to run around in you'll feel the real appeal of this game, not to mention the scope we're working on here.

The cyberstage levels are quick and fun, and the sheer quantity of them would make for an entire past modern Sonic game, it's impressive because they're not even the main focus of the game.

Also these big boss fights are just 11/10",,
Sonic Hedgehog,,
Yes,,
i kissed sonic,,
"This game plays just fine on the Steam Deck! Low settings, still looks very good and keeps a pretty steady 30 FPS. It's fun to play, with many unlocks it seems, that are pretty easy to get.",,
"Took about 16 hours to beat the game, another 3 to finish gathering the rest of the achievements. This is easily a contender for one of the best 3D Sonic games released.",,
I can’t play the game. I’m away from my PC while all my house hold goods are being shipped via army. I have a deck and ally before the update it worked for many users after the update it’s unbearable to even watch a cut scene. They have to fix this.,,
"A game I kept wanting to love, a game I held out hope would hit its stride, a game that never fulfills any of its potential and never discovers its own identity: that's Sonic Frontiers.

Technically, the game is fine-looking but poorly optimized. The movement is relatively smooth, though the homing attack and mid-air dash sometimes have surprising opinions on where you might like to go. The ""cyber space"" levels, more reminiscent of classic Sonic games, are sometimes fun. Some of the music and quick-time events are so comically '90s they invoke nostalgia. There: we're done with the good parts.

The rest of this game has two central themes. The first theme is ""plagiarism."" Breath of the Hedgehog, Soniruga, Tony Hedgehog's Pro Skater, Sonic of War, Sonic Spinball (yes, an actual Sonic game!), and even Pilot Spines show up a few times each. Some of the mini-games I don't even recognize. I was twice asked to be a sheep-hedgehog, for reasons I could not discern. Also, the sheep threw bombs at me. None of these ""mini-games"" are even in the same league as the originals. Balance is terrible, gameplay is limited, and the constant genre-swapping prevents any sort of pacing from developing.

The second theme is ""redesign."" It is very clear there was an entirely different Sonic Frontiers at one point which was hastily redesigned just before release. The game is full of mechanics which clearly used to be deeper, harder, or both, which leaves things laughably bizarre. ""Hey, it's challenge time! Block these attacks with various speeds and timings!"" OK, Sonic Frontiers, but you've given me a block mechanic which features no speed or timing -- I just have to hold two buttons and wait. Or the rather neat ball dropping game which feels like it has great potential, except you're only ever asked to catch one ball. Or the giant combo system full of different attack options which are all basically equivalent and thus useless. Or the ability to upgrade your max ring count -- which is actively detrimental in every way. Apparently, you can fish -- I'm not sure why. If you are careful and build up to max rings you get a speed bonus -- except you can summon as many rings as you want (and, if you're patient, all collectible currencies) at any time.

I would be ok with the game being unoriginal and... somewhat ""eccentric"" if it weren't just so bad. Pacing is terrible, difficulty is all over the place (not only does it not go up evenly, it often goes back down), traversal and collectible grinding both become tedious, boss fights are trivial (assuming you come in with max rings), the story makes no sense until the last hour (and even then it's full of holes) and once it does it's pretty uninteresting -- there's just nothing here that ever becomes ""the reason to keep playing.""

In the end, Sonic Frontiers is a mess. It demonstrates potential, sure, but never achieves it. Not entirely a Sonic game, not entirely any particular game, there may be two or three games-worth of ideas here but there's only about a quarter of a good, finished one.",,

"Didn't expect to find myself playing another Sonic game since Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for Sega Genesis nearly two decades ago, but here we are.",,
"a little janky but overall great, combat was way more fun than i expected even if it was simple. sonic controls well in the open world and its lots of fun to run around the world, the bosses are amazing and probably the highlight of the gameplay. story was the best sonic story in years the characters are written so well and they actually feel like themselves for the first time in forever. cyberspace is poopoo. play on hard mode.

a bird watched me play",,
"They finally got 3D Sonic right again after so long. The characters actually have some personality and depth again, and the new voice direction is so much better here. I cannot express how glad I am we finally have some good LORE and STORY overall back in Sonic FINALLY after the past decade. It's such a breath of fresh air to see they actually care about these characters again. It's so amazing to see them all interact here so full of life, after so long of them feeling lifeless. Thank you so much Ian Flynn and the writing team for finally putting love back into the cast.

The new Open Zone gameplay gives such a sense of freedom and there's always something new to find, which keeps a completionist like me wanting to keep exploring. The combat has been a blast and the different enemies to make sure you know every move of your arsenal. Pulling off a big combo on a boss or a group of enemies is rewarding and very satisfying. Finally, no more gimmicks or stupid quirks to Sonic's combat, just straight up agile and hard hitting moves showcasing his blistering speed. This is what we've needed desperately all along and it's one of the best points of the game. The titan boss battles are some of the best boss fights in the series.

I don't need to tell you how good the music is since it's a given for Sonic at this point. The titan boss fight tracks are sooo good. The Cyberspace stages are very lacking compared to open zone, and are a lot more stiff at first but you get used to it after a while. I wish that you could control the same between open zone and cyberspace, instead of the preset movement Cyberspace uses. These stages are fun for the most part despite some jank, but they don't overstay their welcome and have some killer music. I've been doing all the missions for these (S rank, red rings, etc.) no sweat.
The jank of the movement sometimes overall (mostly in Cyberspace), and the pop in are the only two things I don't like here. PC should of gotten a lot more graphics and frame rate options, as well as render distance options. The pop in being so close sometimes is pretty jarring at first but maybe an update will fix it, if not mods hopefully.

The Meta Era is finally over, and I can't wait to see what the next 10 years has in store. This is the most fun I've had in a new Modern Sonic game in a VERY long time, and I've been a huge fan of the franchise all my life. Please listen to your fans on this one SEGA and keep this ball rolling. I would love to see more of this promising formula.",,
FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!! A GOOD ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SONIC GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,,
It's like an official Sonic Utopia,,
"Great Sonic game with a fun open world, good controls, large enemy selection, amazing soundtrack, hype bosses, and a good story. Try to go into the game completely spoiler free for the best experience. The game has its issues like pop-in, a bit of jank (I actually found this fun because I could do some fun things that send me flying in the open world), a chunk of cyberspace levels are not good due to either level design or controls being weird compared to the open zone, however there are mods that fix the physics in cyberspace, . the pop-in although noticeable, doesn't bother me much. I would really recommend everyone to try this game, it was a breath of fresh air that the franchise needed and I cannot wait to see how they develop this new formula for this new era of Sonic.

Also the PC mods are already insane just 2 weeks after release, these can add so much playtime even after 100%ing the game.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is a new step forward for the Sonic franchise and their most ambitious effort since Sonic 06, although now they have learned from their mistakes. The ""Open-zone"" gameplay allows Sonic to utilize the boost moveset to the fullest and gives people a lot of freedom on how they want to traverse through the levels. Sonic also gets a expansive combat toolset to utilize that is fun to use and feels good to rack up combos on enemies. The Cyberspace levels are the boost gameplay found in most modern Sonic games and I found them to be enjoyable but they tend to meld together due to the reuse of assets of the same couple of nostalgic zones. I like how the reason for the classic themes was incorporated into the story but it would have been nice if there was more variety there or maybe they added themes from classic zones that don't get used as much.

The soundtrack is absolutely stellar, a normal thing for a Sonic game. The ""Open-Zone"" themes fit their respective biomes well and have a nice variance to not get samey well traversing the giant islands for long play sessions. The Cyberspace levels have fun EDM-inspired tracks ranging from many genres from Trance to Future Bass. But what stood out to me the most were the fights. Very heavy metalcore songs with loud and well done screamo vocals that really set the tone for the epic colossus-like fights that are so over the top and some of the best parts of the game.

The story was fun and a nice breath of fresh air from a lot of the games of the modern era. I liked the darker tone and Ian Flynn did a wonderful job with the writing. The characters have a lot of depth compared to previous entries and its very cool as a fan to see the characters reference events that have happened in previous games.

Overall, Sonic Frontiers is one the strongest Sonic games in the franchise and potentially the start of a new era of Sonic like the Adventure games did before breaking Sonic into the modern 3D era. I would love to see what more they can do in this direction with a bit more polish. Check this one out is you are a fan of 3D-platformers and a must-buy for any Sonic fan, but if you are one I really didn't have to tell you that you probably already have this :)",,

WOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU FEELING GOOD,,
"O primeiro jogo que entrega o que eu queria de Sonic... desde Adventure 2, provavelmente. Finalmente largaram aquela babaquice infantil do Generations pra cá e fizeram o personagem ser *cool as ♥♥♥♥* de novo -- melhor pra todos, a criançada vai ter a reação de ""mãe, o Sonic é muito legal!"" de novo, e os jogadores mais velhos... também dirão ""mãe, o Sonic é muito legal""! Em suma, o tom do jogo volta a ser o dos Adventures, que é o que eu queria desde sempre. Eu me importo muito com *tom* em videogames, então pra mim isso foi o principal destaque de Frontiers.

Claro que eu também tenho que falar do roteiro -- o estranhamento, até pela pegada mais séria, é natural -- mas depois que eu me acostumei, tudo fluiu super bem. Na minha opinião, é o jogo de Sonic mais bem escrito até hoje, tanto em coesão narrativa quanto nas falas em si. Entendo alguns preferirem o enredo de SA2, por exemplo, mas a execução aqui é simplesmente superior.

Mas antes que a lei do Carmack venha me pegar, vamos ao que interessa: o gameplay. A primeira ilha é, para mim, a melhor coisa que joguei de Sonic desde Generations. Daí é ladeira a baixo: o core loop se desgasta relativamente rápido, acho que até mais pela forma na qual a decidir jogar (focando em abrir o mapa primeiro e fazer as coisas depois), mas até que segura surpreendentemente bem a experiência até seu fim. O que piora com força mesmo é o level design: a segunda ilha é pior que a primeira, e a terceira é bem pior que a segunda. O boss da terceira também é bem jankyzinho, então nem isso salva. Pelo menos o boss da segunda ilha é um dos melhores da franquia.

Contudo, pra mim o jogo da um bom ""pick-up"" perto do final: me diverti com a breve quarta ilha, e gostei bastante da quinta, mesmo com . Mas aí o final... hum. Narrativamente? Amei. Roteiro? Top. Estética? Arriscada, mas gostei, achei conceito. Gameplay...? Não tinha uma ideiazinha melhor não? Eu não cheguei a odiar, mas o final cria um contexto tão legal que eu simplesmente esperava ficar menos apático a ele. Uma pena.

Os gráficos são “bonitos o suficiente”, assim como o character design novo que achei… ok! O que me incomodou foram as cutscenes: pré-renderizadas, de qualidade batatosa, e lockadas a 30FPS. Ridículo.

A trilha sonora é *gif do cara tocando piano pegando pogo*. Simplesmente maravilhosa. Meu Deus, como senti saudades de uma boss fight aonde eu não sabia se me concentrava do gameplay ou se ficava batendo cabeça, bom demais. E a trilha é ótima em todo o seu ecletismo: a metalera é boa, o acompanhamento sinfônico temático das ilhas é bom, as músicas eletrônicas do Cyberspace são boas, e as músicas mais “tristes” definem muito bem a emoção das cenas onde são postas. Sound Team de parabéns, como de costume. Absurdo ela não estar no TGA.

Em suma, muitas coisas podiam ser melhores, mas Sonic Frontiers é realmente um jogo muito bom, e recupera o que, para mim, é a melhor abordagem do personagem (SA, SA2), há muito adormecida. Espero que continuem nessa linha -- não de gameplay (sinceramente, pra mim, já deu por aqui, não tenho muito interesse em ver eles reiterando esse fórmula), mas de tom. A Sega **tem** que observar a ótima ressonância que o tom do jogo teve com os fãs e até com o público ""externo"" e mantê-lo. Isso é essencial, ou eles vão alienar todo mundo de novo, e talvez aí seja definitivamente.

Agora é torcer pro Iizuka parar de baitar e meter um SA3 logo.

É isto. Se você é fã da franquia, considero Frontiers um título essencial, até por essa importância de recuperação de tom. Se você não é fã, mas se interessou por algo do game, certamente será uma experiência divertida, mas espere a Sega parar de cobrar o preço de um Patek Philippe no jogo.",,
"Frontiers brings a breath of fresh air to a series entering stagnation, while also paying full service to longtime fans of the series.

The core gameplay still follows the basic boost formula, while tweaking and adjusting enough to feel new, and to fit nicely into the open design of the hub islands, and blend smoothly together with basic but satisfying combat. This does come at somewhat of a cost to the feel of the more linear levels, Frontiers does not reach the same heights in that area as games such as Generations, but it is still fun and enjoyable despite that.

The open islands are far from the most intricate or tightly packed of open world hubs, with most of the collectibles being the Memory Tokens, of which you only need to collect a fraction of what is available to unlock everything, but in the less restrictive open world the controls are more than enough to make collecting them just for the sake of doing so satisfying.

As for the story and writing, the overall story is unfortunately somewhat bland and predictable, but is saved by excellent character writing and a perspective on the core Sonic cast that is both refreshing and deeply rooted in these characters' origins and history. Some characters, particularly Eggman, could be read as somewhat 'out of character' compared to other recent games, but the approach taken to these characters here is more in line with older games that took a more serious tone, rather than the lighter and more frequently comical tone the series has been written in as of late.

Overall, while the game is definitely not perfect, and players, particularly ones without a history with earlier Sonic games, will likely be much less charmed by it, Frontiers thoroughly charmed me as a near-lifelong fan of the series, and I sincerely hope that it is the solid ground the series needs to achieve new heights.",,
game good,,
"Welp here it is, Sonic Teams take on an open world---- oh pardon me open zone game is finally here

Full disclaimer I am a huge sonic fan and have played and finished most of the mainline games. But as for Sonic Frontiers---yeah it was ok, most of my issues with this game were from a technical side and lack of polish. Like the pop in didn't ruin the game for me, but it is HORRENDOUS and you will notice it throughout your time spent with this game.

It is fun to control Sonic in these big environments, you can finally turn while boosting and it gets even better at top speed, launching yourself off rails and flying across the map. And kudos to the devs for allowing you to fine tune the controls (honestly reminds me of tuning a car in a racing game) however it is also janky, stiff and inconsistent. Sometimes Sonic will launch himself off a ramp just fine other times it feels like the earth's gravity is just got 20x stronger.

The Cyberspace levels and the Combat in this game are just fine. The levels themselves borrow a lot of assets and layouts from previous titles. They are better than any Sonic Forces levels by a long mile in my opinion.

Plotwise I'd also say it's just fine. The writing and voice acting is the best this series has gotten over the past decade really and it is without a doubt because of Ian Flyns writing and direction. There are a lot of callbacks and references to past titles and even some nods to more obscure characters in the Sonic lore. But if you're not a huge Sonic nerd like me I think a lot of these will fly over your head, but I'd say that the plot was just fine because the references were a little heavy handed and losses the game some identity of its own when you're constantly referring to the past. The game's structure itself does not lead to the best storytelling if you ask me, there are only so many different ways you can spin going to a new island saving your friend and defeating the big boss and move on to the next.

So overall would I recommend this game? Well if you're a Sonic fan you probably already got it in your collection. But if you're on the fence or curious I'd say wait for a sale, by then modders may have fixed some of the rougher edges with this game. I am curious how Sonic Team will follow this up, I’d be down for a more polished content rich version of frontiers, Hopefully this game does well so they can be more ambitions for the next title",,
"I... Am at a loss for words.

I genuinely think this might be the best Sonic game.

After having to put up with mediocre title after mediocre title for so long... Seeing this masterpiece has renewed my hope in a way I never thought possible...

The gameplay? Stellar. The writing? The best in the series. The graphics? Great. The music? PHENOMENAL. The only major criticism I can think of is that the cyberspace levels felt bad to control at first, but even then, getting upgrades to your speed helped mitigate that over time, so even the one criticism I have diminishes the more you play the game. Granted, I'd like it if that was cyberspace from the start, but it's better than being stuck with it for the whole game.

Put your money where your mouth is, and let Sega know that this is what we want.

In summary, Sonic Frontiers is absolutely worth your time and much more, in my opinion.",,
"This game is a love letter to the whole franchise. Sonic's last 15 or so years have been pretty rocky, but this game has finally broken the curse. Speeding through the open zone and quickly pulling off tight platforming challenges feels AWESOME, and the ability to tweak Sonic's controls to personal preference was such a smart move to accommodate for all different play styles. And for once, the writing does not feel like an insult to my intelligence. The story had depth and was packed to the brim full of lore that helps cohesively connect the franchise's various settings and stories together. The characterization itself was incredible, and it warmed my heart to see Sonic and his friends interacting together on what actually felt like a meaningful level. This game is everything I have been wanting and waiting for in a Sonic game and I would absolutely love to see other games in this format. If you're a fan of the Adventure games, this one's for you.",,

"Competent writing, a new main gameplay loop that somehow works within both old and new level designs alike, and a good chunk of fanservice. And it doesn't even lean on Classic Sonic as a crutch.

It's hardly perfect, but it's a breath of fresh air. It feels like Sonic Team is genuinely *trying* again.",,
"After over a decade of mediocre and bad titles(with the exception of Sonic Mania), SonicTeam have finally graced us with an okay mainline Sonic game.
Took 'em long enough.

Game is fun for what it is, but very basic.
Even though I played on hard mode, most of the game was easy enough.

I don't think I could call it a great open world game though.
It's just mostly running around empty fields, that have linear set pieces plastered everywhere.
Most of the time, the springs, dash pads and dash rings send you into whatever directions the paths were designed with, but that feels very counter-intuitive to an open world game.
You'll find yourself avoiding the pre-designed pathways, and just run around them to get to your destination.

Combat is really basic. More flashy than interesting.
I defaulted to using a move that asked me to do nothing more than jump and hold LT on the controller.
Took care of virtually everything I needed.
The parry move the game introduces early on is laughably broken, since it requires no timing to execute, and you can also use it to float in the air indefinitely.

The game has optional cyberspace levels that try to emulate the boosting style games that came before this one, and it is by far the weakest part of the game.
The controls feel very off.
You can avoid these levels, and try to progress through the game using other methods in the open world.
Thing is, cyberspace is the fastest way to obtain the collectibles necessary for progression outside of the fishing mini game, so you're encouraged to play this weak portion of the game. A very conflicting design choice.

Right... I mentioned fishing. It's just kind of there.
A fun novelty at first, but it requires you to just press one button, between two to five times, mostly depends on the catch. It's good for farming collectibles, but it ended up making me wish it had more mechanical depth.

Assuming SonicTeam wants to follow up this game with another that builds on top of the foundation established, then they have a lot of refining to do.
Still... this is SonicTeam, assuming they'll follow it up, let alone follow it up well is not guaranteed.

If you're gonna get it, wait for a sale. It's fine, but way over hyped.",,
"Sonic is good again.

I'll first preface this by saying, this game certainly isn't perfect. It has plenty of jank, and it's pretty obvious a lot of its design is console-first with PC as an afterthought. That said, all told this all has a fairly minor impact on the overall experience. What has a larger impact on the experience is the Cyber Space stages, which vary from good to... kinda bad. Sonic controls much worse in Cyber Space stages than he does in the overworld, ESPECIALLY in 2D stages. That said, once you find fishing spots, Cyber Space is basically optional.

Beyond those initial caveats, this game is pretty damn good. It's genuinely some of the best open world-style gameplay I've played; Sonic's speed actually lends really well to the format, and he handles exceptionally well in the overworld. (And if you don't like how he handles stock, there's plenty of ways to tune it!) There's lots to do and explore, and each island is bigger than the last, with the final island being especially huge. There's plenty of fun miniboss fights against the Guardians scattered about, as well, with many different types on display, all handled in different ways.

And then there's the proper boss fights. I'm not going to spoil anything, but all of them are glorious. Especially the third island's boss. Great fights, scored with some absolutely fantastic hard rock sending you right back into the early 2000s era of Sonic games.

The writing is also quite possibly the best the series has had since the Adventure games, at the best since Unleashed. It's a delightful return to form after over a decade of overly quippy writing from Sonic games. The interactions between characters are some of the best we've ever had. And Big exists! Why, we have no idea, Sonic's just as confused about it as everyone else. But hey, you can get items from fishing that as mentioned above, can essentially render Cyber Space by and large optional, so you don't have to deal with probably the least fun part of the game in most circumstances.

I touched on the soundtrack with respect to bosses, but I will mention that pretty much all of the game's music is really damn good, and I'll admit that as much as I don't care for Cyber Space, the tunes in there are some serious bangers. I'll admit I'm pretty biased, as I'm a huge electronic fan, but that's easily the best part of the Cyber Space stages.

Anyway conclusion is: Game good but not perfect. Sonic is good again. All is right in the world.",,
"The game is amazing. There's a lot to do and a lot to see, the jumps are admittedly a little weird feeling at first. Other than that, this is what open world games should be. There's detail and things to do literally everywhere, it's not just barren wasteland of grass and occasional tree. This is definitely the greatest Sonic game they've made in a long time.",,
"PEAK

Edit (10/11/22)
So, I've just finished the game, and to expand on my review, holy ♥♥♥♥ is this game good, the controls are some of the best since sa1, the story is and dialogue are amazing (as expected of Ian Flynn), and the music is jammin like always. If you've been sceptical of sonic team after 2017's Sonic Forces (which fair, I was too before the marketing for this game really ramped up), then don't be, they completely pulled it off and made the best sonic game in 11 years (not sure if it beats gens for me, def beats it in story though lol). But yea anyway game is PEAK, you should buy it N O W",,
"Sonic Frontiers > Sonic Forces.
This game can't really be compared to other Sonic games. I think this game is really unique in its own way and it makes so much fun to play. I can recommend this game to every Sonic fan!

Edit: The stage music isn't really fitting for the game. There should be more music like in the boss fights ;)",,
do not compare this to breath of the wild bro i swear to god,,
Gotta go fast!,,
way past cool,,
"4 hours into this game and I already absolutely love it. There is so many things to do right off rip like collecting kocos, side quest collectibles, cyberspace levels, boss fights etc. The music is AMAZING and truly brings back the early 2000's punk vibe. Sonic has never controlled better in 3D too. I am for sure 100%ing this game. I think gamers from all walks of life will enjoy this, cant recommend it enough!",,
"Listen it clear this game was made with sonic fans in mind and as someone whos been playing the games since Mega Collection on the gamecube I can safely give my opinion on this new title. Basically we are so back Sonic chads, the music, the gameplay the story its all so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good. Obviously there are some genuine problems like the graphical fidelity not being as good as say even Sonic Unleashed which to me is still the best looking 3D Sonic game to date. And the pop in is a little distracting I didn't really notice it until I got to the fourth island but even then it didn't really affect my enjoyment overall. The cyberstage levels have also been receiving a ton of slack from fans and haters alike but if you just think of the cyberstages as the special stages of the game and you realize how little you actually have to play them to progress then it should be clear that it isn't a big deal. But I really just want to gush the music first of all slaps so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hard its unreal. All the boss themes and the credits themes are absolute bangers and deserve to be listened to outside the game itself. Second of all the story was also so good especially for long time sonic fans like myself. I don't wanna get into spoilers but a ton of lore is expanded upon and new questions sort of get raised throughout. Listen if you're a sonic fan you'll like this but if you're not and think it looks interesting I'd say wait for a sale. Otherwise this is an excellent game and I look forward to the potential of an Adventure 3 ;) 8.5/10

Update: I hope this wins for best OST",,
"This game made me care about Sonic characters again. They're not just static stereotypes anymore. They feel dynamic, and they remember events from past games, and they actually interact with each other in meaningful ways. I know that's a very low standard for writing in any games, but this was something we needed in a Sonic game since 2010.

Exploring the open zones is pretty fun, and Sonic controls quite well- the best since Adventure 1 and 2. It's just simply fun to zoom around the big maps and do things here and there, especially if you install a momentum mod. Not only that, but some of the enemies around these maps are pretty fun to fight, especially when you unlock all of Sonic's skills.

Cyberspace levels are the opposite. I think they are a step up from Forces, but that's not saying much. Sonic feels awful to control in these levels. He somehow has some of the most stiffest yet loosest controls in these levels, and the levels themselves can be quite hit or miss- mostly the latter. The best of the cyberspace levels are basically returning level layouts with multiple paths and a strict S rank requirement (looking at you, 1-2!), allowing the player to really push the movement system to its limit as they replay the level.

The soundtrack is incredible, especially in the context of what's happening in the game. I will never forget how incredibly fun the bosses are (except for the final boss on Hard difficulty).

This game, while not my favorite, sets the foundation for future Sonic games. If SEGA can keep this momentum up, they could make some of the best Sonic games. I have high hopes for the future of this franchise (please bring back other playable characters, too!!).


TL;DR - Eggman didn't piss on the moon. 0/10.",,
"I have literally zero gripes with this game. But I'm gonna make this a short review.

The last Sonic game that I played AND invested time in was Sonic Adventure 2 BATTLE for the GameCube. I loved every bit of that one, and this one takes the cake.

Let's talk:

Graphics

It's a Sonic game.

Music

Jesus LORD ALMIGHTY THERE IS NOT ONE TRACK ON THIS OST THAT IS NOT A BOP.

Hands down one of the greatest OSTs I've heard of all time. Everything meshes well together with the scene that accompanies each track and what it represents. Not once did I dread any location in this VIDEO GAME because of the amazing soundtrack. It carried the mood whenever I felt like I was running in an empty, lonely void.


There are only two moments where I felt like things were being recycled, and it was negligible: Enemy types and overall theme of the cyberspace choices.

Past those two, EVERYTHING ELSE felt like a breath of fresh air. Each boss, minigame, zone, track, loops, felt new and innovative to the game.

There are two modes you are able to choose from at the beginning of the game (and edit through the options later on if you change your mind): and . The Sonic Team recommends the latter for veteran Sonic players and the former for newcomers.

Everything feels incredibly as you progress through the game - powering up your stats of Power, Defense, Speed, and Ring Capacity.

By default, the tutorial is your loading screen so you're never staring at nothing; there's always something to do.

There's fishing that DOESN'T feel tedious, isn't that great?

Sonic Frontiers has everything - and more - that you thought you needed in a Sonic game.


The fact that they tie the continuity of the stories of the PAST GAMES into Frontiers will make all Sonic fans want to be even more involved. Frontiers really brings everything together and even provides some comedic quips regarding characters and events that are not featured in the game.

It's pretty mysterious, and you will have questions

..

and you will buy Sonic Frontiers to answer those questions.


If you love the aesthetic/feel of TLoZ: Breath of The Wild (all emptiness included), the intense music of DMC, and the action and speed of Sonic, then Sonic Frontiers is a fantastic pick.

It's more than a ""Sonic game.""

It's a labor of love.",,
"Spoiler-Free Review.
tl;dr - The best 3D Sonic title in years. It contains some jankiness and the performance is not impressive, but the story and gameplay is fantastic. A game full of fun ideas and makes the future of Sonic titles look bright.

Overall an 8/10 (Great) from me. My thoughts on the game below without spoiling anything.

Finished the game, roughly 15-20 hours of Campaign give or take.
The game is called ""Open-Zone"" for a good reason, there are roughly 5-ish islands and you can collect everything you need to advance the story in whatever order you choose.
Comparing to previous games:

Story - 9/10 (Excellent)
Bringing Ian Flynn from the Sonic comics was a smart move for Sonic Team. Without spoiling anything, the characters have received great character development and the dialogue has been immensely improved without losing it's wittiness. The plot has serious moments as well that are well done, and a decent number of plot twists that make for an interesting story. It honestly feels like potential setup for a Sonic Adventure 3 title, but that might just be copium.

Sound / OST - 9/10 (Excellent)
Sonic doesn't usually miss with it's soundtrack, and this game is no exception. The good thing I have to say about this game compared to previous Sonic games is that it's steering back to hard rock and metal with song choices, especially for boss fights.

Combat - 9/10 (Excellent)
Despite it's simplicity, combat is extremely satisfying. I believe in future titles they should strive to bring it closer to a ""Devil May Cry"" style of combat, and add more complexity to it. The option for auto-combos is lame, and I'd recommend avoiding it entirely. Enemy variety is great this time around. They all attack Sonic in unique ways that are fun to figure out.

Visual Design - 5/10 (Average)
The stylized characters in Sonic simply do not match the environment that this game is in. Seeing Sonic next to a photo-realistic-style alligator is... kind of ridiculous. World design is also kind of boring to me, it feels like a bunch of islands that had grind-rail assets thrown onto them with little rhyme or reason and are called simply ""ruins"". They make sense if you take the game's story into account, but it feels uninspired and lazy. This in contrast to the Cyberspace levels is the complete opposite. The level design is gorgeous, but limited in variety. Why are there so many maps just themed after Green Hill, Chemical Plant, and Sky Sanctuary? Every map should have looked different and that aspect is a bit disappointing. The maps themselves, however, are visually incredible, and I wish there was more of it. My last complaint would have to be how difficult it is to see objects sometimes, but that has more to do with performance than design. Some color distinction or indicators for certain collectibles would have helped a lot.

Controls (8/10 - Great)
Sonic in the open-zone feels great to control, complete freedom of movement. While Sonic is a bit more restricted in Cyberspace, he has more freedom than in previous games, and the levels are actually pose a little bit of challenge at times.

Difficulty (5/10 - Average)
The game's difficulty is extremely inconsistent, and feels like it was poorly balanced. Some portions of the game, especially early on, felt way too easy. Upgrading Sonic's stats made the game significantly easier, so I may try a second playthrough without upgrades to see if it improves the experience. There are also some portions of the game that go from extremely easy to annoying. I don't want to use the word hard, because hard would imply a fun challenge, but some places don't give you a proper save, especially before a boss fight. It causes you to be locked to a specific number of rings, for example, and be stuck dying repeatedly because you ran out of time with nearly impossible time crunches. Much of the ""difficulty"" can come from jank too, but this is mostly just for boss fights in particular.

Boss Fights (8/10 - Great)
Feels a little unfinished at times but incredible on a cinematic sort of level. The music adds a ton to the fights and finishing end-bosses feels absolutely amazing. I do not wish to spoil them, I'd advise you to play the game yourself.

Performance (4/10 - Below Average)
Default settings ran too slowly and the game crashed a few times on initial setup. There is a lot of ""pop-in"" in this game. Loads of assets tend to be invisible unless you manage to render it, and it is quite a short distance. Assets also like to disappear when you are still looking at them too. Why not just have them disappear if Sonic isn't looking at them? I don't know if that's the case but it's so easy to miss things just because they weren't loaded properly. 60 FPS lock is also kind of garbage but this is a cross-platform game so it's bound to happen.

Might add more thoughts to the game later but that's about it. I like this game a lot and am considering getting all the achievements, but I don't really have the time or interest 90% of the time so we'll see.",,
"Started at Midnight....its now 6 AM...... Fun....yet still wonky. But it works. Could become dull with minimal change in enemies but not fully stagnant. Will change review at 15 hour mark to see if it became better or not.

Edit: 20 hours in and beat the game. Its fun. Still has some wonk but playable and actually really enjoyable. I would say its a 40 to 50 dollar game. Open world was really fun to just run around in. the fishing is......bare bones but its more to speed up you collecting things if you want or eggman back story.

All in all get it if you like sonic generations or sonic adventure 2. Cause the combat is lackluster but the bosses and minibosses do make it more fun....but the basic minions get boring quick.",,
"Product refunded

A lot of people recommended this game to me, but I was extremely dissapointed. I play a lot of Sonic, I love the guy. But this game starts out very weirdly. There is a lack of music in the overworld which is unfitting for Sonic, who is known for his bangers. I liked the jukebox feature, but none of these songs fit the vibe of the game and they don't belong to this world.

The game was heavy glitching on me. I was hitting invisible walls non stop, Sonic was running on air half the time, parts of the map were missing and I was seeing a lot of void.

The game is super ugly. It's not the bright and colorful Sonic I know, fine. But I played on the highest settings and it was still a messy experience.

Overall I am glad I could refund. It's sad to not play this game after anticipating it for so long",,
"This game is insanely carried by it's soundtrack. Also, Denuvo.",,
Man ♥♥♥♥ denuvo get that ♥♥♥♥ OUT of here Sega this stinks literally unplayable 2fps c'mon you can do better smh,,
Speedy boy🐥,,
"`This is one weird game to rate. It's both an incredibly good game and the worst Sonic game to ever come out.

Now allow me to explain this statement. The game is incredibly good. The gameplay, while jarring at first, is smooth and in no time you'll zip around jumps, rails and floating balloons at Mach 3. The variety of activities to do is pretty fun, combat is, while very easy engaging enough to not become boring, the graphics are pleasing.

But it's a very bad Sonic game, in fact, you could replace Sonic with any other fast character and it'd probably be better. Were SEGA to remove the iconic Sonic stuff we could barely tell it was supposed to be Sonic. Understandable, that should rightfully put off a lot of people.

That said, I have no idea what the interns in charge of writing the story at SEGA were on.The story makes no sense whatsoever, nothing is explained to you. You're just thrown into doing random tasks because the game asks you to with no explanation. From time to time the Evil Cyber Loli comes to tell you you're not invited to this damn party and tease the f out of you. Otherwise you spend your time cutting grass and herding rock people to give Sonic the power to summon chaos emeralds out of his ass temporarily.

Now for the lists:

GOOD STUFF:
• Going faste
• Beautiful graphics
• Banger OST
• Activities are cool
•

BAD STUFF:
• Bad lip syncing
• Some stuff isn't even voiced
• Story continuity is ♥♥♥♥♥♥
• That is, whatever SEGA is pretending is a story.
• Would be a better game if Sonic was replaced with Klonoa.

Overall, I recommend playing the game mostly if you like chilling and doing things. If you want hardcore content and A to B missions with defined objectives, it won't be for you.",,

"Not perfect by any means. Decent gameplay despite all the flaws it has. The Super Sonic in this game was amazing though, and if improved, would be a welcome addition for the future games. Cyberspace stages were fun, until Final Horizon stages arrived. Most of the gimmicks for the Final Horizon stages were annoying, or redundant. Time bomb was probably the only gimmick that was decent. Apart from that, Final Horizon as an update was solid, fixing the game's biggest problem, which is the ending.

Overall, it was good enough for me. Hoping that the future games' quality only goes up from here.",,

"This is the most fun I've had with a Sonic game in a long, long time. Controls feel weighty, grounded and responsive. Battles are a thrilling challenge and exhilarating experience and there is so much to investigate over each island! Traversing each island is a brand new fun experience and I really do adore the different outfits you can give Sonic - he's so cute in his Christmas outfit :(<3",,
"The best Sonic game since Sonic Generations (2012). Over the last 10 years, Sonic has been up and down. Sonic Lost World was decent, Sonic Forces was just kinda crap, the Sonic and Sega racing games and Team Sonic Racing were great kart racers and the 2 Movies were really great. So overall everything but the main games were good. That is why it is nice to see Video Game Sonic have a really great main game after so long.

First off the game play is pretty different from recent games. Its still boosting but its in an open world rather than level to level. There are still traditional sonic levels to play but they are not the focus of this game.

There are 4 Islands (Technically 5 but one is very small and you do one task and its 100%). The first is grassy, nature and stuff like that, the second is a desert island, the third is a lava and ice island and the fourth island is another grass and nature island. you do the same thing on every island. Collect memory token for 1 of Sonic's friends that are trapped there, Fight bosses to get gears for portals to cyber space, complete the cyber space level and get a keys, use the keys to get the 7 chaos emeralds, go Super Sonic and fight the boss, rinse and repeat. once you have done all that, the island is then about 30% complete as there is a bunch of optional side quests to do around the island.

This game gets heavily compared to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and that is basically what it is. Its Sonic of the Wild. This is a good thing because it works really well.

There are ALOT of Easter eggs, references and voice lines about previous games, locations and other characters from across the sonic lore like mentions of Cream, Sticks, Dark Gia, Space Colony Ark, Spagonia and more.

Mt Favourite thing to do is just to run around the islands and parkour. It just feels really good to do that, like swinging around in New York in Marvel's Spider-Man. It feels natural.

Of course there are issues. the biggest one being the pop in of objects and platforms. It takes you out of the experience a lot.

Fortunately the story and antagonist are really good. The story was written by Ian Flynn , who writes the stories for the sonic comics.

Plus they have announced a Road map for 2023 including a new story, new playable characters, new missions and new outfits.

So overall after a really great movie (Sonic the Hedgehog 2) that has become of the best and highest grossing video game movies of all time, A good follow up from Sonic Mania (Sonic Origins), A new Netflix show coming soon (Sonic Prime) and a main game that got 2nd, i believe, in the game awards for best game of the year, but was beaten out by Genshin Impact (Sonic Frontiers). I'd say Sonic has had a good 2022",,
"Product received for free

I really liked this game before, but now after the 3 updates I think I love it.

It was insane to feel something about Sonic again, my favorite little guy is finally back and I'm excited for the future. I say this genuinely, this was my favorite game of 2022 and its now only better.",,

"a bold take and a bold direction, but ultimately a half baked, overpriced and genuinely awful game with a weirdly written inconsequential plot with 10 hours of pointless filler and build up, alongside with a borderline inconsequential ending.",,
"I am writing this after 100% completing the first island of the game, and messing around on the second for about an hour. The first island took me about 10 hours and I loved almost every second of it. This is solidly the best Sonic game we've seen since Generations, and I didn't even mind Lost World that much. It also features a huge step up in writing, thanks to SEGA bringing in Ian Flynn, who's known for turning the comics around and improving them drastically. Here's to hoping we can see many more Sonic games in the future with this degree of quality (or even higher), even if not in this style!

While I don't usually like to give a number rating to a game, before I dive into the core parts of the game, I will. I'd say it's solidly an 8.5/10.

The gameplay when out in the open world is genuinely amazing. It takes inspiration from the best parts of Mario Odyssey, and sometimes Breath of the Wild as well. Out in the open world you'll be running around collecting memory tokens and completing short less than a minute long ""puzzles"" that are about as complicated as Skyrim's statue turning ones. The method of collecting memory tokens very much is inspired by Mario Odyssey, as these tokens will be laying out in the world openly sometimes, available by doing a quick spin around a glowing blue aura from the ground, or by engaging in traditional-esque gameplay in the open world, which is what those floating platforms and rails are for. The Breath of the Wild inspiration mainly comes down to how the cyberspace stages exist in the world and serve as a brief (and usually not as great) emulation of the classic gameplay the series is known for, in Zelda's case being dungeons & puzzles, while in Sonic's case it's fast-paced platforming.

These traditional stages are honestly not that great. They're about as short as the stages in Forces but that's not a bad thing in of itself. The main issues I have with these are Sonic's nerfed moveset and the blatant reuse of stage elements from previous boost games (most notably Unleashed and Generations). To start things off, you don't have a drift, and that is absolutely terrible in some parts of cyberspace. Your air boost is also nerfed tremendously, with it giving an incredbly short and minor boost in speed that doesn't give you enough distance to make jumps that were possible in Unleashed & Generations' levels. The homing attack & your method of attacking enemies in these cyberspace stages are absolutely atrocious as well. Most of the time attacking an enemy will only slow you down, while in previous Sonic games using the homing attack was a fast way of dispatching enemies or accessing shortcuts, here you have an immense amount of lag after homing attacking an enemy, both in the open world's combat and these cyberspace stages. With no drift and rather terrible air control these stages are nowhere near as fun as they were in Unleashed & Generations, but they're not bad. These are still fun to play and their Forces-tier length makes them more fun to perfect your time in them. To see a comparison of a Green Hill level from Frontiers and where much of it's level design is stripped from (Green Hill Act 2 in Generations), I'll link two videos here showing me play through them both. The stage in and in .

The combat... is a bit messy. In general it feels very stiff. There are unique and interesting enemy designs here, which require different chains of attacks to defeat them, but it's not very fluid. The homing attack has similar issues in open world combat as it does when in the cyberspace stages, that being when you attack an enemy using the homing attack you have to wait what feels like forever before homing attacking another. Most enemies don't go down with just one homing attack, but on the first island there's packs of 5 enemies that pop up randomly and can be dealt with via just one homing attack. These combat encounters are singlehandedly the worst in the game due to how slow the homing attack is. I should note that on other islands they seem to pop up as well, but require other methods of attack. The other enemies in the game are a lot more fun to engage with however. Some require you to use certain attacks, which certainly spices up the gameplay a bit but some may think it's just pointless when in previous games a single homing attack could dispatch any foe. The enemies the game marks with two clashing sword icons on the map are much more fun to fight against, with the exception of the Squid on the first island. It essentially creates a long purple bridge with 3 lanes which is about as complicated as Temple Run is. You chase him down on this bridge he makes until you get close enough to homing attack him and start an actual combat encounter. If you're not fast enough you might have to do this in 2 or even 3 cycles. At the time of writing this I haven't encountered any other enemies like it thankfully.

Being how I've only completed one fifth of the game's story, I can't speak on the entire game but I very much so have enjoyed the writing and characterization I've seen so far. It's a huge step up from every game since 06. The voice cast sounds just a little bit different this time around, with Roger giving Sonic a much deeper and manlier voice this time around, which sounded strange to say the least at first. You can interact with Amy, Knuckles, Tails, and the mysterious Sage on the islands, and you use memory tokens collected in the open world to unlock new dialogue with them. From seeing all the dialogue with them, you obtain a few chaos emeralds while grabbing the rest from exploring the open world. Once you've obtained all emeralds & seen all dialogue, you can transform into Super Sonic and go off to fight a massive kaiju. These fights are an absolute blast and aren't too hard either, which is why I'm including them in this section rather than the combat section. The cutscenes aren't that greatly animated, and the dialogue within the open world is very Ubisoft-like, with the characters cycling through a few animations and poses while talking. I don't mind it, but others might.",,
"The game is a free roam sonic game, so its fun, but Sonic Team have done literally the bare minimum past that. The Cyberpsace levels are literal garbage, like worse than Forces. But they arent the focus of the game thankfully.

"This game is alot better than i originally expected which i'm super happy about! I love just running around in the world, i had alot of fun with the vast majority of cyberspace levels + their music and the characters are written super nicely too!
It has it's flaws here and there but it was never anything that ruined the experience for me, just things that can be improved in the future like more varied world themes, mostly but not only thinking of cyberspace

Overall a very nice game and i recommend playing it!",,
"I haven't play Modern Sonic in years, and this was the first time in years I had so much fun in a Sonic game, despite having a lot of lore details that I'm not familiar the story is presented very well, voice acting was decent tho Roger Craig Smith's new take on a more mature Sonic was really clever.
The gameplay is all the way fun and worth the time to 100%, running really fast to travel feels so satisfying and fun, combat is good and more enjoyable if you try to diverse the different moves that Sonic can do.
the third 3rd island was the only least fun part with the way it was designed, but it still didn't ruin the overall fun, Sonic's physics could do better but Sonic Team is clearly on the right path, I'm really looking forward for what's next.",,
"This game is peak 3d Sonic. There are absolutely some issues, it's not perfect, but it's the best 3D sonic game since Sonic Adventure 2, and has the best boss battles in the franchise by a wide margin.

If you're an older sonic fan, one who has stuck with the series for a long time, and have played most of the games, experienced the stories, and learned to love these characters, you will absolutely LOVE the writing here. The story, while not groundbreaking, is amazing worldbuilding for the franchise. Not only that, but we're finally starting to see the rebuilding of the sonic world in terms of lore, Characters name-dropping specific scenarios from previous games, cementing their place in the canon, and calling back to specific events. It's fan service, but it's fan service that was long overdue after the 12 or so years of sonic games having saturday morning cartoon stories.

The bossfights in this game, without spoiling, are peak sonic. I have never been more hyped in my 20 years being a fan, and it hits ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ HARD from the first major boss onward, with an incredible soundtrack that will go down as one of the best.

If you are a sonic fan, you'll most likely love this game. If you're not, you still have a pretty solid platformer here with semi-open world action as well as traditional linear levels.",,

"Frontiers is pretty cool, especially with physics and music mods coming out for the PC port. The story kind of fell off near the end unfortunately and has a plot point that I feel wasn't explored that well, but has an interesting ending. I recommend buying it when it goes on sale though. It's a fun time, but not worth $60 imo.",,
genuinly a solid open world or well in sega's case ``open zone``. Now the graphics are pretty good you can change how sonic controls and have an alright fighting system and exploring the open world is a treat and have a way to play more linear levels like in the boost games that sonic had. To a scale to 1 to 10 its a 8/10,,
"Okay, Imma say it. At first, I enjoyed the game. Sure, it was different, but I like different.... UNTIL DIFFERENT BECOMES THE SAME TWO OR THREE GIMMICKS CONSTANTLY. Cycloop and rails are a major part of this game, with rails being everywhere in the cyberspace levels, slowing you down if you don't do some techniques you'd expect from speed runners (no pun intended), along with being the primary way to get around in some islands where there are massive gaps to block your way. Along with this, the enemies are all generic and too samey, with even earlier minibosses coming back with a new paint job and maybe one or two new moves.

We also have the return of QTEs and side scrolling sections. I honestly loathe most QTEs, especially when they are in boss fights like in Frontiers. I also despise how there is side scrolling FORCED ONTO YOU if you aren't careful in the open world which is frankly just plain ridiculous. Plus the Koco are frankly just annoying when you have to deal with their minigame missions. You're supposedly helping them, yet you keep having them do ♥♥♥♥ like blowing ya up with bombs while you try herding them into one area! And let's not forget to mention how your speed is cut off during this stuff! There is also the ""puzzles and challenges"" which include stuff like Pinball, Cycloop around glowing stuff during nightfall, and sidestepping onto glowing platforms. I did enjoy the stepping on the colored squares to turn the whole board dark ones though, I'm a sucker for that type of thing for whatever reason.

And as for the bosses themselves, the first was okay, loved the theme and was getting pumped while thinking ""yeah, Sonic is finally back in town!"" I got my opinion changed quickly as the bosses just became less interesting and the other songs played. Granted, I have no issue with the other songs, but Undefeatable is basically on the same tier as Metal Gear Rising music in my book.

Fun fact I forgot to mention when first making this review: EXTREME COLLECTATHON THAT CAN ACTUALLY MAKE YOU GO INTO THE 2D SECTIONS.

I won't spoil the last boss, but I didn't play this game to do a crappy version of Nines' minigame. Props to you if you catch the reference, but holy HELL is the last boss annoying and I'm still trying to beat it! All in all, while there are a few positives like seeing Sonic be a little more expressive, Tails getting some of his old self back, Big being around to fish with even if fishing is also a basic QTE, some nice music as per usual, and some nice references to the IDW comics like Sonic mentioning Tangle, I am just not a fan of this game and hope the next one does better. I'd give it a 6/10, maybe a 6.8/10 when I'm not being irritated by the gimmicks which is honestly rare.",,
"The average duration for the main campaign of Sonic Forces was ~2h, it took me 18 hours to complete this game's main campaign. You can probably see how much of an improvement this game is.

However, this game does have quite some flaws, the most notable being the lack of animation overall. Whenever you get into a cutscene the characters are incredibly stiff... when they do move, as most of these consist of Sonic and buddy X just standing and doing weird head movements.

The open ""zone"" gameplay is... alright I guess. It's extremely repetitive tho, you do some rail grinding, destroy some enemies, run on walls amongst other stuff to get a collectable and repeat, for like a 100 times each zone. Also, you gotta love it when a dashpad that you can't see locks you into a 2D area for the 5th time. Didn't really have too much problems with the ""pop-ups"" of platforms, but I guess that depends more on hardware.

The cyberspace levels are also fine I guess? They only have 4 stage themes across for like 30 levels, which makes them super forgettable, but they aren't TOO terrible. They kind of are just a quick diversion from the main gameplay.

There's an actual story this time, but it also had some really weird moments during certain points. It kind of tries to be similar to the Sonic Adventure 2 story arc, but I think it just misses it. Again, better than nothing!

Soundtrack ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ slaps tho.

Boss fights are fine, some of them overstay their welcome, but I think most of them were good. The titan boss fights are the highlight of the game, but I regret to inform you that these are just glorified cutscenes, they present no real challenge. Still, pretty epic.

OH YEAH, this game has Big the Cat. 10/10",,
"The combat may just be mashing a button over and over again but when you're flying around as super sonic, fighting an enemy straight out of shadow of the collosus, and listening to heavy punk-metal, it just hits different.",,
"Sonic Frontiers tries to take a new step for it's franchise, putting Sonic in an open world with a new combat gameplay style and i must say they have done a VERY good job!
While there are some issues they are minor compare to the good stuff that this game offers, Firstly the combat is super enjoyable to use, it is very satisfying pulling off combos, every move really fits Sonic and it seems they have made a really unique move set that is not just generic punching.
plus running around in the open world feels awesome!
the islands offer a lot of puzzles to do and they are different in each one whether it would be running to an end point against a time limit or throwing a huge ball into a ring or even just playing JumpRope, all of them are really neat and do not get so repetitive quickly.
The Cyber Space levels are also very fun, while i do feel Sonic controls a bit off in them it is not so bad as how he was in forces, the levels are pretty short but there are some that are 2 minutes long and they give you a lot of freedom in movement i must say the majority of them offer a great time running through them and replaying them.
And the story of the game itself is one of the best we have gotten in a long time, I loved seeing Sonic talk to everyone, the dialog felt really well written and the cutscenes did a fantastic job with making everyone look alive plus all of the references to past games didn't feel force and were fun to hear.
Oh yeah, and the OST is nothing but awesome, the music they put in the bosses are literally the best i heard in a Sonic game, and the music in the Cyber space levels are also very good while in the open world it feels really relaxing.
All in all while there are some stuff they need to improve on like the pop in issues and to give a bit more to do in the islands and of course making leveling up the Speed and the Max Rings faster, i really loved my time during this game and happy to see Sonic doing super well with a lot of other people enjoying this game too, i hope they will keep this strike of good games going from here on out!",,

"good game with actual game loop and solid construction that people will call bad because they're actively looking for a reason to say Sonic is still bad.

"TLDR: Is this game perfect? No. Did I have a lot of fun with it? Yes. Would I recommend it? Yes.

I was one of those people who were leery of the idea of an open-world Sonic game and not impressed by the early glimpses we'd gotten. I am pleasantly surprised by just how good and how much fun I've had with this game, but that does not mean it is perfect or free from criticism.

★ Gameplay __________________

The gameplay is divided into two major categories - the open world, and the cyberspace stages, which both have a completely different feel.

By and large, the open world feels pretty good. It feels reminiscent of Unleashed, tho lacking in certain aspects of control like the drift. It also employs a combat system that took some getting used to. The idea of being able to parry in a Sonic game is still extremely foreign to me despite having finished the game.

As for the cyberspace stage gameplay, it feels more reminiscent of Forces. That is to say, extremely clunky and precision platforming is an absolute nightmare. I basically played the cyberspace levels enough to 100% them and have no intention of returning. Open-world tho? The first two islands feel SO GOOD to just run around and vibe in. This is the first time since Unleashed where I truly feel like I have a sense of what it would feel like to be in Sonic's shoes, blasting around in whatever direction my whims take me. The third island onward things get a bit frustrating with a lot of forced 2D segments that are difficult to break the camera out of. Is it a dealbreaker? Nah, but it is annoying.

As a final thing to point out, the boss fights at the end of each island are, generally, an absolute spectacle with a couple of exceptions. Also wtf to the hard mode final boss. It's not necessarily BAD but.. VERY VERY not what I expect in a Sonic game.

★ Aesthetic __________________

Hit and miss for me. I do think the open world is gorgeous, but nothing about it feels 'Sonic' to me. I'm also not a fan of the bumpers and rails just randomly placed around the realistic looking open world. Don't get me wrong, I generally find them fun from a gameplay standpoint, but there was absolutely no attempt to integrate them into the island's aesthetic so they just look jarring and out of place. Either they should have been more integrated into the chosen aesthetic, or the overall aesthetic should have been made more Sonic-like. Preferably the former. I would love if an update was made that removed all of them so I could just run around the maps freely without looking at them.

For your more familiar checkerboards and whimsically designed robots if you happen to be missing them, you'll want the Cyberspace levels, but even then you'll just run the same three-four level aesthetics over and over again. It sadly feels very much like they cheaped out on the assets.

★ Story __________________

This was the major draw for me. Sonic comic book writer Ian Flynn was chosen for the script, someone the fandom has been calling for years to work on the games. Does the story live up to expectations? Overall, hell yes. The character interactions feel genuine. They feel like actual characters with personalities and relationships and not flanderized tropes spouting one-liners.

The story focused a lot on uncovering the mystery of the Starfall Islands while also working to rescue your friends, along the way dealing with the new character Sage. Sage is a worthy addition to the cast in terms of character (not so much in design, in my personal opinion), and the overall mystery had me intrigued. I livestreamed the whole game over the course of several sessions, and the entire time I found myself speculating in my attempts to figure out what was happening. There are a couple of major aspects (no spoilers) that I wasn't happy about, but overall, I'm very satisfied and hungry for more of this kind of writing.

Also, can I just say that I'm pretty sure I was the ONLY person who called Sage's story and relationship among the characters prior to the game's release? Can I brag about that? I'm going to brag about that.

Anyway, Sega, more of this. Please. Give us more story and more fleshed out characters like this. These are the characters we deserve.

★ Music __________________

It's Sonic music, it's usually the one thing you can count on to be amazing no matter the quality of the rest of the game, and this does not disappoint. There's a couple of tracks I was meh at, but overall? Excellent. I have been listening to Breaking Through It All on loop for several days and I am begging you to NOT send help.

★ Overall __________________

Overall, definitely give this a look, especially if you're a long-time Sonic fan or perhaps a former Sonic fan who stepped away from the franchise. It's not perfect, but it's fun. I hope that Sega will revisit and refine the concept of an open world Sonic game in the future. And, I would be 100% okay seeing Green Hill yet again if it was in an open-world style, I'm just saying.

Hoping for some good DLC!",,
I LOF SANIC HEDGAHOG SO GOOD GAME.,,

My expectations were really high. They have been far exceeded.,,
"Fantastic Sonic game. It doesn't fall into the usual trappings of Open world games since you constantly have ♥♥♥♥ to do and are quick on your feet. Making the BotW like mini dungeons into boost like levels was a pretty good idea. Frontiers probably has the best selection of levels in any boost game. There is 30 of them and perhaps two or three of those are not worth replaying at least once.

What also helps is the combat. Instead of playing like typical action games you need to actually engage with enemies in non button mashy ways. The combat would be just standard affair if the game didn't have so many well designed enemies.

There is a fair bit of jank though. You can feel that Sega like always rushed Sonic Team to the finish line and while I wouldn't say it's unfinished there is definitely need for fine tuning like getting rid of the pop in, having more balanced rpg mechanics or turning off certain one off UI elements that might get annoying after a while.

8/10 Top 3 Sonic games for sure. Can't wait for the next one.",,
"Heya. I steam has an issue posting my review, so I can't post it here right now. The first paragraph is underneath. If you want to read all this stupid review, I have it here. https://textdoc.co/e9P87TKGMmwashXo

To explain my credentials on this topic; I have been a Sonic fan for many years. I have completed a good proportion of all Sonic games. And by ""all"", I mean ""all"" the Sonic games released. I went in this game completely blind, and now I have beat the game 100% by 11/13/22. I waited to get rid of initial bias, and to get views from both sides. I will give a general overview next.

To answer the first question, ""Is this game bad? Did SEGA screw it up again?"" No, not entirely. This game is about a normal, passable game. I had fun at least. This is the part where I get laughed at. For a first-time Sonic player, this game can be actually good. However, this is not a good ""Sonic-game."" It's an alright Sonic game. My worry is that if a first-time player thinks this game is actually good, they will believe this is the epitome of a ""Good Sonic Game."" Sonic can be better than this, and I will be more harsh on it. It is about a 74 percent for me. I will now go in depth.

"I was excited to give this one a try. I got it on Steam for PC and refunded it in 1 hour. Could not get over the early alpha feel of the game in general. Horrible cutscene quality at 4K with ugly compression, blurry UI at 4K, 60fps cap, stiff animations, pop in, lack of dynamic shadows, everything looks evenly lit, at least the first island did. The settings menu is also a pain to move around in.


I didn't get too far, the story seemed the run of the mill, Eggman does something stupid and you deal with the consequences, the game mechanics felt like proof of concepts, specially the mid air slashing thing, you can just spam it infinitely in the air white falling in slow motion while everything else moves at normal speed, makes for some pretty anticlimactic stuff, kind of like the gun in Devil May Cry, but with jank animations. Furthermore, the lackluster level design and art direction, a realistic world, with Sonic stuff floating mid air for some reason.

I am not particularly fond of the, collect things in an open world to unlock the next area endlessly concept either.

I will definitely keep an eye out for any updates by the devs that could make the game better, specially for PC, as of now, seems like a tech demo of a future Sonic game bottlenecked by developing it for the aging Nintendo Switch.

Wait for a sale and updates is my recommendation.",,

But seriously this game is actually a return to form for Sonic with actual meaningful character interactions, PEAK boss fights, and good fishing. Cyberspace levels are just there but the main meat of the game, the open zones, is fun to explore.",,
"EDIT: Actually, I'm gonna lower my score further. Its a 5.5/10 now. The islands get worse and worse, more repetitive and more confusing as you go. The first two are okay, but from then on, its really boring. I hear the last two islands are just repurposed amalgamations of the ones prior to it as well, which if true cements my point even further.
The first island and its boss are the highlight of the entire game.
Id actually rather play forces, because that at least knew when to end, and wasn't 60 dollars.
I didnt even pay full price for this game and I still feel kinda ripped off.


6.5/10, wait for a sale or check other sources unless you have nothing to do

To summarise and avoid wasting anyones time including my own, the physics are really bad at times, especially in 2D, and they're using old zones and ideas for what will now be the 4th time debatably in the last decade. Feels like a very polished fangame, but a fangame nonetheless.

I think if you're a younger fan and/or have low standards then you'll be fine and hyped with this, but otherwise its just a mediocre time waster with strong points that're only strong because they're very derivative of other games/media that already did it way better, games like breath of the wild, metal gear rising, ratchet and clank, even nier automata a little, and even the other games in the sonic series.",,

"Absolutely loving the game itself. In fact this may just be my favorite Sonic game by far. Only problems are, it doesn't play out well on PC/Steam Deck, and the SA2 Shoes code offered by subscribing to the newsletter says it's not available in my country (U.S.).
During TGS, Sonic Frontiers was shown alongside other games coming to Steam Deck, but it's labeled as unsupported. It *technically* runs around 60fps but shader cache stutter (presumably) and more importantly, lighting bugs where anything unshaded flickers rapidly. Honestly I wouldn't usually mention Steam Deck in a game review, but the fact that there was an expectation set by Valve for the game to function on it at launch despite not actually happening is rather disappointing, and I'm not sure if this is anything Sega/Sonic Team is responsible for or if they will do anything about this.",,

Best Sonic game ever!,,
"All I can say is yes
It's a must play",,
"I nominated this for the labor of love award because they gave us 3 FREE, amazing updates in 2023. It's not fair that I can't nominate this for game of the year, update 3 basically made it a whole new game (which released in 2023). It deserves that game of the year award AND the best soundtrack one, but labor of love makes sense too, so it'll have to do.

Don't pay any mind to the people who say that Denuvo makes this a terrible game. It really doesn't affect the game much, apparently, having it lowers the FPS slightly, but most people will never notice it. I don't have the best computer and I played reliably at 60 FPS the whole time, so the average player will be unaffected.

People also complain about if Denuvo ever ends support the game would become unplayable, but that's true of EVERY game on Steam. If Steam ever got rid of Sonic Frontiers you couldn't play it. Most people don't BUY games anymore and don't own a physical copy, if the hosting service goes, so does your game. If Denuvo ever goes Sonic Team could just remove it, I don't know that they WILL, but they're innocent until proven guilty. Can't hold them accountable for a wrong that they haven't committed yet.

This is a great 3D Sonic game period. It plays similar to Zelda BoTW. It's a little rushed at the end, but the free updates will fix that, the first 2 were great, and the third and final one should be coming sometime in the next few months. But by far, the soundtrack is what solidifies this as one of the best Sonic game ever created!",,

"I think it's decent enough but it doesn't try to do anything fancy with the tools it has and also seems like it was never fully completed, the developers just had a stable beta they released. It isn't like it's buggy or anything, and it has a decent amount of content but said content mostly consists of inexplicable floating platforms and rails in the world that look purely artificial and unreal, or instanced levels with a handful of visual themes they cycle through, calling back to previous sonic games and no attempt to seem related to the island's environment. Also it has some serious popin issues that make it hard to find where a platforming challenge begins because you can see part of a challenge, but the start of said challenge simply isn't visible so you have to try and follow what is visible so you can find the start and get it to pop in. Weird amateur hour stuff, like they're working with 10+ yr old hardware as the benchmark for the game.

Lastly, I wish in future Sonic games they make skipping cutscenes and dialogue faster. I mean, going fast is supposed to be the philosophy of these games and the plot sure ain't worth sticking around for.",,

"In a nutshell, the game is ""Aight"" to me. It's a solid piece of playtime, but not something I'd be happy to spend 60€ on again. To me, it feels as if the game is functional, but was never properly polished beyond that point. The controls are servicable, but specifically dodging or switching rail tracks when grinding (done via the same button) are really stiff movements that feel unnatural.

The combat is very basic. All of the moves chain into each other, and there is really no sense of timing because you can just buffer all of your inputs. Parrying in particular has been dumbed down from other games, whereas you can simply keep the button pushed and Sonic will parry automatically, regardless of how good or terrible your timing is.

The skilltree is more akin to a skill branch, which you can completely fill up by the time you're at the 3rd act. It's very simple, and most of the time simply spamming the most expensive skill you've unlocked is the best way to go forward instead of trying to combo any of them.

The story is this game's strongest aspect. The characters constantly reference older game's happenings, which can feel a little forced at times, but it does demonstrate a nice sense of connection between games and experiences. The characters all behave in believable ways that don't clash with their core ideas (Lookin' at you, Sonic Forces), and work with you on uncovering the lore behind everything.

The graphics settings are just like the rest of the game. Basic. You either get 30 or 60 FPS, there is no support for Ultrawide, everything that isn't the terrain pops in at around 20 meters of distance, which is really jarring. The lighting occasionally messes up water and puddles, which can appear bright from one angle and dark from another, which can be really distracting for some of the minibosses that have been placed in a puddle.


TL;DR: Buy this game at a discount, and you'll have a servicable experience.

it just felt like an open world game with random sonic assets strewn about,,
this game is fun you can run around,,
"If I had to pick between recommending and not recommending, I think I can say I can recommend it on sale of <$40 given the current amount of content and game length. If you’re a huge Sonic fan, you’ll likely be getting this either way at any price, but this review isn’t really for you. If you’re on the fence, trust your gut and wait.

On one hand, this is one of the better 3d sonic games I've played with the least amount of jank. On the other hand, the bar for a good 3D Sonic game is low so that's not saying much. If I were to compare to this other open world action games, this one would be average and even on the lower end there; however, it's FUN to run around as Sonic in an open world and generally going that fast isn’t a hinderance. In 90% of instances, they give you enough on-screen information and decent enough camerawork to make sure it feels nice. There are some points where you’re scratching your head in frustration because Sonic didn’t quite move how you expected, but in general, and compared to other 3D Sonic games I have played, this one frustrates me the least.

I can’t say how this review will change after the “free” story content releases – it certainly can’t be worse unless they introduce bugs, but as it is now it’s about a 16 to 20 hour game for $60. That’s a hard sell for anyone looking for an open world action RPG with minimal story. If you’re a huge sonic fan then please feel comfortable buying it, but I still recommend getting it on sale. Most of the gameplay will be spent in the open world and not the traditional old-school Sonic “levels” so just keep that in mind.

I enjoyed my time in this world and given the ending, I’m surprisingly hoping to see what they do with the additional content this year.",,
sonicbros.........we won..............,,
Tis good. Pop in is kinda bad like most people say. But can recommend.,,
"Each individual island in this game is about 3-4 hours long each.

Sonic Forces was notorious for lasting around, well, 2-3 hours.

Lol.

(Also going into this game with an open mind helps, give it time to sink in)",,
"♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, a good Sonic game! I had all but lost hope by here we are.

Okay, I got that out of the way. Now let's talk about the game.

Sonic has finally returned to form in a game that feels like everything Sonic Team has experimented / fumbled with over the years and merged it with how many hours their team has put into playing Breath of the Wild. It's a game that puts you in a sandbox of beautiful environments with high octane speed and face melting visuals. The game is just gorgeous and fun to play.

What's good about it: It's a Sonic game that makes me feel Sonic's speed. There is a fair amount of level progression and skill unlocks to give enough versatility in your skill set and it's also surprisingly fast to pick up. It helps if you've played previous Sonic games, but the learning curve isn't steep. It's challenging enough but not overwhelmingly so. The open world is fun, the non-linear exploration is enjoyable. The combat is super fun and the music score is fantastic. If you like Sonic games, really, read no further.

The bad about it. It's formulaic and often repetitive. To progress in the story, you have to collect an arbitrary amount of tokens in the open world, the get keys, then get emeralds. You are gate locked a lot in this way and I find myself wandering about the open world just trying to get what I need so I can progress the story. Once you complete the first area, you go to the next and basically lose your ""power-ups"" like Samus Aran at the start of every game. Then it's the same thing over and over again. Collect your stuff, gather your tokens, kill the big bad island boss. Repeat. That's really my main complaint about the game. It's not as immersive in the story as I'd like. Don't get me wrong. The story is pretty good so far, but it's just stuck behind gates you have to unlock.

That and Sonic is sometimes too fast for the map. Yes, he is -too fast-. There are times parts of the world don't pop in faster than you can run through areas, which leads to some confusion. I imagine this'll get fixed later though so not really too concerned. And even then, it's more inconvenient than anything and not game-breaking.

All and all, it's a worthy entry to the Sonic franchise. I've definitely been enjoying it! Worth a buy.",,
"Few positives:
- Running around the open world felt nice, I loved how tight sonic was to control
- the characterisation of everyone is pretty great, I like the direction they’re taking them and hope they stick to it. Sonic especially, I would like to see him be a little more jokey since most of his jokes fell pretty flat but they're no where near anything like baldy mcnose hair.
- Music is great
- Super Sonic is finally cool again, the ♥♥♥♥ he does in the boss fights is really sick
- I like the attempt at a more serious story
- Cyberspace can be pretty solid when it's not janky and there's a legitimately really cool stage near the end of the game that feels pretty original and had like 4 different pathways

Negatives:
- The world is boring and forgettable
- Cyberspace was either solid or ♥♥♥♥ because they try using Adventure level layouts which don’t work very well for this moveset
- Not a fan of Sonic and Knuckles’ new performances; Knuckles just felt flat, couldn't get past the weird surfer kind of voice the VA opted to give him, and Sonic was generally very inconsistent. Felt like Roger kind of drops the gruffer voice mid-way through the game or at random points like talking to Big where he sounds like his usual self. I generally liked Sonic's voice when it wasn't just Roger's standard low tone he does for most games so I hope we get more of that.
- For a next gen title, it’s laughably bad graphically
- The gameplay loop of collecting emeralds and memory tokens is repetitive as ♥♥♥♥ and doesn’t feel satisfying after you realise you have to do it 4 times in the ""20 hour experience""
- Combat gets pretty redundant quick after you get new moves even the early ones
- Puzzles are built for babies
- The rails and mini bosses that pull your control away are a pain when you’re trying to get somewhere
- Felt like the entire game was rushed once you get past the third island

I think most people will enjoy the game but personally I was really feeling it slow down after the first island where it felt entirely repetitive and hard to force myself to play. I found it hard to sit through the story because it was told through visually uninteresting cutscenes that didn't hold my interest, I mean you've got one of the most expressive video game characters of all time and yet they hardly take advantage of his entire range of facial movement.

However, I am still looking forward to the future of this franchise. The new gameplay style is really fun and if we get a more interesting and unique world to explore with thoughtfully implemented puzzles/platforming segments, it could very well be a really fun game! For now though, I am not a big fan of Frontiers especially for getting it at standard price. If the price does drop and you like Sonic, I'd snatch this up.",,
"Almost everything about this game is bad. The challenges feel like they were made for 5 year old kids. The combat is repetitive and sometimes depends on mashing. The graphics and scenes are ugly. Sonic's feet feel like they are glued to the floor. The only good thing about the open world is the platforming.

Most of the cyberspace levels are copied from unleashed, generations, and adventure 2. There are only seven completely new levels, and they're all fun, but there are two cons about them: most of them are way too short one of the levels was only 30 seconds long and the jump feels very heavy.

Feels like sonic team can't do good games anymore",,
"Let me get this out of the way right now: Sonic Frontiers is not a perfect game. It's janky, it's flawed, it's unpolished, it's lacking in some key areas. And I loved every second of it.

As someone who's played every mainline Sonic game, this game feels like a return to form and recaptures everything I loved about Early 2000s Sonic. The open world isn't perfect, pop-in is a major issue, especially when trying to hunt for certain objects in the sky, but I was still compelled to explore every nook and cranny and 100% each map (as well as the fishing game. Great to see Big again in a semi-major role!). While I and many others would have loved to see momentum in the game, I still found lots of enjoyment improving Sonic over the course of the game and learning how to use the environment as well as the set pieces to my advantage, even doing a fair bit of sequence breaking to grab items in unintended ways.

Also new to Frontiers is a more in-depth combat system. While simplistic, I found it to be a ton of fun. This isn't a super complex system, but Sonic has a pretty decent move pool to make wailing on bad guys lots of fun. My only major gripes are the infinite parry system (A generous window + a ""perfect timing"" bonus would have been more enjoyable), and how early you max out the skill tree. By Island 3, I had every single move and by the end of the game had hundreds of unspent skill points. I can't talk about the combat without mentioning the end of island boss fights however. I won't spoil them, but the major boss fights are genuinely some of the most hype moments I've had in a game in recent memory.

One of the more interesting parts is a return to the more serious story telling the """"dark era"""" games had (which I'll say right now I loved, even when they may have flopped on their face. I appreciate the effort.) While the writing can feel a bit hamfisted in some of its callbacks, it's great knowing that all of these games are still canon and this game does a lot to re-establish a cohesive universe that felt sorely lacking from the 2010s era (as well as do away with the D-Tier Saturday Morning Cartoon Writing), and this is easily the best story since SA2.

All in all, this isn't the best Sonic game ever... Though I might put it in Top 10, barring waning relevancy bias. It's flawed, but a great time over all, and I'm especially excited for all the free DLC coming in 2023. If you're a Sonic fan that's been tired of the series more bland recent entries, I encourage you to give this game a shot.

Oh, and if someone from Sega is reading this: Stick with this gameplay style. It's got some kinks to iron out, but there is so much potential for a follow up with a solid foundation built in this game, and I eagerly await a follow up into new frontiers.",,

"Needs a boss rush feature or a way to re-challenge boss fights, ending is a little eh meh with some unanswered questions here and there. After forces however this is considered a masterpiece in comparison, combat is fluid is feels nice to string together combos, exploration is ok with only a few scenarios that are frustrating to navigate to. Oh and the music hits haaaaaard, youtube it at your own peril before playing for fear of spoilers.

Solid 7.5/10",,
"It's okay but not the second coming of Sonic that fans are saying it is. Sonic can run fast in the open world but running fast along the ground is just about all he can do. There is no proper momentum or advanced movement techniques, you hold the sprint button until you reach the next set of grind rails and spring pads that will force you along a 15 second predetermined path that ends with a collectible.
The cyberspace levels offer nothing beyond what the levels in Forces offered, a short <2 min linear hallway where you hold boost and occasionally do a homing attack chain to cross a gap before landing and boosting down more hallways.
The combat is super button mashy and even on the ""Hard"" difficulty offered no challenge.
The dialogue and tone of the story is also quite melodramatic and while it's a breath of fresh air from the ""Baldy McNosehair"" tone of the last few games it's still not great.

The Super Sonic fights are pretty cool though.
I'd only recommend this game for full price to a Sonic fan who's desperate to play a modern Sonic game that isn't total hot garbage.

Port Sonic Unleashed to PC already.",,
"Amazing Sonic game. It has an open world, exploration, mini sonic old school levels, variety, weirdness, accessible and fun to play. This Sonic game has set the foundation for future Sonic games. It feels really good to control the blue Hedgehog again. Story is good cheese for a video game. Its running smooth as butter. Game looks great, sound and music are pleasing to the ears. You can check my computer spec in my profile. I recommend buying this game to support future single player games. You can also check out reviews and gameplay to help you decide if you want to buy the game or not. Best experience is to go into this game with minimal info so you can discover the game on your own. Take your time and enjoy the beautiful maps. My guess is this game could be 15-20 hours long.",,

"I played this to the end
It's very refreshing to see sonic in open world again

A bit of sonic adventure DX vibe (hope there will be a remake)

the downsides of this game is

- ALOT of re-use assets from greenill or other level, so not much variation
- Levels are TO short The levels seem shorter than the previous ones
- Graphics are neh
- We are in 2022 and it also looks like it is port of switch with small extra option
- Pop ups of stuff
- Cutscene are pre-render, And the result of that, poor quality,
- Hard mode., it's still very easy...

But it's a fun game, but the price could be a little lower..",,
"Sonic Frontiers is very action packed game with so much to explore and learn about the Starfall Islands. There is a lot of good and bad with this game. On the bad side some controls in ciberspace are a bit tough to use, springs not working and other bugs, many enemies just attack unprovoked and limited replayability of much of the game. On the good side there is however much more. I really liked the overall story even know it was a bit anticlimactic. It was so much fun to explore the open world of the Starfall Islands because there is so much stuff not to mention the day night cycles, weather including rain, and how great the Starfall Islands looked with so much details on them. The enemies seemed about the right level of toughness. The fishing game was really fun. I also liked that you can level Sonic up and give him more attacks to use. I would say it is one of the best Sonic games that I have played. This game lot of fun to play. Overall I highly recommend this game.",,
"Summary
In short, Sonic Frontiers is a flawed but amazing experience. Like most Sonic games, it has it's fair share of issues but instead the majority of those issues being flaws on a fundamental level, most of Frontiers' issues stem from subtle performance hiccups and a lackluster endgame. Other then that, Frontiers is one of the best Sonic games I have ever played, featuring a solid gameplay structure, amazing boss fights, and a great soundtrack. The game left me wanting more and I don't mean that in a bad way!

Overall, I'd give Sonic Frontiers a solid 8/10!


The Negative
Starting with the bad stuff, the obvious place to start is the performance. The game runs beautifully and never once frame dropped or crashed on me, however, the pop-in is extremely annoying. There was no attempt to mask it (like a fade-in effect or something) and sometimes objects don't appear until you're right on top of them. Truth be told it was never an issue during a casual playthrough for me but the more you play it the more you notice it.
The achievements for Frontiers are pathetic. The time it takes to 100% the game is laughable and that's because the lack of achievements in some instances is questionable. There is no achievement for completing all of the missions in all of the cyberspace levels. There is no achievement for getting all of the in-game collectibles. There is a lack of achievements for combat outside of the main bosses, only having one achievement that requires a specific action to be completed 50 times (). It did hurt knowing that there isn't much to do for 100% completion unless you want to self-impose a 200% challenge where you collect everything.
The end of the game is pretty weak. To summarize it without spoilers, the last 2 islands are underwhelming and the secret final boss you get from beating the game on hard mode is baffling and I honestly wish the game didn't have it at all. The game starts to drag a bit near the end of the third island but ultimately wraps up before it becomes detrimental to the experience.
While I don't hate the cyberspace levels (I'll explain further in the positives), in a pre-release interview Takashi Izuka said that those portions of the games were included because they believed some people didn't want entirely new gameplay. That alone made me furious. Everyone that has kept up with the series had begun to loath the boost formula and the linear design. The boost gameplay peaked with Sonic Generations back in 2011 and that's where it should've stayed. I hope going forward, Sonic Team tries to do new exciting things as opposed to holding on to old things that worked years ago as a make-shift crutch.

Sonic is really fun to control. You can customize him anyway you want and while most people just cranked the sliders to max it's still a cool option. Unless you're on rails, momentum is a bit limited but is still fun to mess with. Sonic's range of moves is a huge step up from Sonic Forces and while most additions are great, the drop dash was surprisingly pathetic. You would mainly want to use it in the cyberspace levels to gain speed on slopes more efficiently but it reacts super weird and isn't worth using. I don't want them to get rid of it since using it in the open zones to chain together movement options is a treat.
The Cyberspace levels, while pretty lame on their own, became way more enjoyable once you realize that Sonic can cancel a homing attack by boosting to gain an insane amount of momentum. Whether intentional or not, it takes the cyberspace levels from being a negative to becoming a positive. It's so fun to break the levels and makes you feel really cool despite the fact you're most likely a grown man playing a Sonic game.
The boss fights are easily the highlight of the game. I don't know how the series that is infamous for having the worst boss fights in gaming managed to make some of the best bosses in platforming history but they made some truly memorable fights.
The combat, while not anything special, makes me extremely optimistic for how they could improve it. It's a solid foundation, I just think they need less attack options and more movement options or skill boosts on the skill tree and it's perfect! While it can be a little button-mashy, it's not super tedious and can be quite fun if you learn how to effectively string together moves!
The music is very interesting, containing a variety of tracks that all sound great (outside of a few cyberspace levels). The boss music made my jaw drop and the open zone tracks are lovely. EDM isn't my favorite genre but I'll admit that some of the cyberspace tracks were pretty good but most were bad.
The story isn't award-winning but Ian Flynn has been writing these characters for over a decade and it shows. I legitimately couldn't stop smiling whenever Sonic and Knuckles interacted and the story actually kept me invested. I'm so glad that Ken Pontac and Warren Graff are gone because after dealing with their awful and cheap writing for over a decade, I don't know if I could've handled another atrocious script. Flynn thankfully delivers, although he can get a bit obsessed with throwing in too many references.
The freedom in the game is extremely refreshing. There is multiple ways you can progress through that game and that freedom actually makes me forgive a lot of glaring problems because if I don't want to do something, I simply don't have to.

After being disappointed with Lost World, upset with Sonic Boom, and bent over with Sonic Forces, the fact that Sonic Frontiers ended up being decent meant the world to me. It showed me that Sonic Team was still capable of good things after a decade of fumbling. I'm honestly shocked the game was worth the 60 USD price tag and them some, especially since the modding scene has already cracked the game wide open. If you enjoy platformers, do yourself a favor and pick this one up!",,
"Flawed, but a good game.

The open zones are a blast and the boss fights and music are great as well.
Best written dialogue in a Sonic game to date.
Combat is pretty fun if you disable auto combo.
The game is not hard, play on hard mode if you have played any Sonic game before.
_
Most of the issues are a simple lack of polish, some simple fixes would be:
*Have the trigger for Sonics voice lines be a set distance from a structure rather than at the entrance.
*Let us upgrade speed and ring capacity more than once at a time. [FIXED]
*Some things require it to be night, please let up pass time from the pause menu.
*Parrying is great, but undermined by how easy it is, you should be able to hold it for a second max.
A good example of how broken it is, go to a jump rope puzzle and start it, hop just above the ground and hold parry, you can float there for the entire duration.
_
The more frustrating things are:
*If you boost while in the air, you have to land again to be able to boost again.
There are some awkward times in which you use boost to get into homing attack range, just to hit a spring and need to boost again immediately, but can't so you just fall and hit the spring until you pull Sonic out of automation to touch the ground, then try again.
A quick fix would be, homing attacking an enemy, or bouncing off of a spring should reset your ability to boost.
*There are some common enemies that hijack your camera and make it awkward to run around, you can just kill them, but they come back after a while.
*Hiding springs and dash panels underneath a spot marked for cyloop is just stupid, whats even more stupid is that walking away hides them again immediately.
*Sonics all or nothing speed when climbing walls is just bad, the slow grabbing animation is worthless and your next slowest climbing speed is way too fast for some sections.

*Why are the menus and cut scenes so SLOW? restarting a cyberspace level after getting the goal should be just as seamless as restarting from the pause screen.

One cut scene for putting in the gears, then the one of it powering up, then sonic entering cyberspace, one minute of game play later I watch him come out of cyberspace, I got keys!, an emerald is ready, an emerald is ready, an emerald is ready. Even skipping them all is too much.

*Revealing the map is nice and all, but it sometimes takes longer for that animation than whatever you just did, I would like an option for the animation to wait until the next time you open your map and then just play all of them at once.

*Getting hit by Giganto really shouldn't awkwardly steal my camera and force my camera to look at sonic long enough to get hit by Giganto again.
_
Weird and cool things I noticed:
*You can use Light Speed Dash on seeds, gears, and experience points.
*Boosting right after starting a homing attack flings you really far and can be quite fun, it's especially helpful for getting a better time in the arcade.
*1-2 is the hardest stage to get an s rank on, it's not even close to any other stage.
I would love to see an optional S+ rank going forward in games that have a similar time requirement.
-
DLC Nitpicks:
*Why does knuckles have a turning radius while gliding.
*Amys normal attack is with Tarot cards? She has a hammer ffs.
*Why must I go to the training thing ever time I get an ability in the skill tree, I know what it does and how to do it, it tells you in the description of the move.

*Giganto DLC fight: I am all for learning the fight better to get the parrying down, but every time I fail to parry I have to sit and wait for my camera to slowly turn around otherwise I get hit by the next attack that I can't see.

*Why does the music player stop when doing anything?
It stops when in the map, when fighting the world bosses, and when doing time trials, that's the entire game!
-
Overall a very good game, I'm pleased with the challenge that the DLC offers but it definitely is not for everyone.
This game is the definition of rough around the edges, but if you like sonic at all you will like this game as it is a massive step up from the last few 3d entries.",,
Collect-a-thon disguised as a Sonic game. Running around to collect hearts to get a 30 second cutscenes to only to be made to collect more hearts to get another cutscene isn't fun Sega. Why can't we just get a Sonic Adventure 3? Or even Sonic Heroes 2?,,
"TLDR: First Great Sonic Game since Sonic Colors (2010). A definite must play.

This is a long review because I love this franchise, but this game definitely deserves it.

I'm 22 years old and grew up playing my older brothers hand-me-down Sonic Adventure 2 Battle, Sonic Heroes, and Sonic Mega Collection (Toxic Caves is an absolute BOP) on the Gamecube.

I refused to watch any promotional media so I went in completely blind, well, as blind as you can be to a franchise with 31 years of history. I was actually expecting to be MORE than thoroughly disappointed thanks to Forces & Lost World being in far too recent memory. I was also pretty hostile towards SEGA for removing their 2D Sonic ports in order to sell the remakes through Sonic Origins. Even with the negative outlook that Sonic Frontiers had working against it, I have to admit that I haven't had this big a smile while playing a Sonic game since I would hear that infamous City Escape bassline after coming home from Elementary School as a kid.

With that being said, here's my honest opinion: This has been the best 3D Sonic game since Sonic Colors. I've been thoroughly disappointed with SEGA's lackluster performance when it's come to 3D Sonic games. It's as if they saw Sonic 2006 flop and said, ""It's not the unpolished gameplay or gamebreaking bugs, it's the fact that we weren't bending over backwards to dumb down our gameplay and writing for literal toddlers!"" Retro (pre Wii) Sonic titles were also mostly made for children, but I'm still able to go back and have them hold my attention as a grown adult where other nostalgic franchises fail to do so. Frontiers managed to break through and balance out BOTH gameplay AND character writing where other 3D titles have failed time and time again for 21 years.

Frontiers' gameplay is very unique. It almost feels like Sonic Heroes' abilities all got mushed together into one character with the open world running mechanics being a Frankenstein hybrid of Sonic Unleashed and Adventure 2 with just a hint of Colors as a cherry on top. Call me schizo because even though I understand the explanation in my head the way I worded it feels wrong, but that's as good as it's going to get. Also, the overhauled combat system means Sonic can throw hella hands now >:)

The thing that surprises me the most about Frontiers is the writing. There are, thankfully, far too many scenes where there are genuine moral dilemmas and adult topics that are explored through these characters in a way that hasn't really been done before . It's a very welcome surprise that a majority of cutscenes aren't just some cheesy meaningless one liners with half baked jokes. Sonic and his friends experience anger and frustration in far more subtle and complex ways than previous titles. Time and time again I would go Into cutscenes expecting to react by rolling my eyes and saying ""Pffft yeah right, thats not at all how people react. This is just slapstick humor clearly aimed at children,"" and yet more often than not I have been left speechless while embracing Sonic's new and unexpected mature/responsible albeit frustrated reactions to situations. Sometimes the writers simply leave me saying ""Damn. . ."" The storyline isn't the best but the characters feel real, they aren't forced to be the one caricature that other modern titles try to force Sonic, Tails, Amy, and Eggman to embody.

I may be singing Frontiers' praises but don't get me wrong, Frontiers has MANY quirks, and not all of them are pleasant, I'm not a fan of the forced hint pop-ups that completely stop your momentum even AFTER you've been thoroughly introduced to a mechanic with a tutorial. And DO NOT get me started on the half sentient camera that refuses to cooperate when you need it to the most. However, the hint popups become far less frequent and you learn to anticipate the camera's shenanigans. There are many little other quality of life nitpicks like how cutscene transitions feel very abrupt, or how you'll be running along and run into a miniboss just to be forcefully taken out of your activity to rewatch the same cutscene announcing the bosses presence even when you aren't going to fight it. Things you get accustomed to after a couple of hours of playtime. The writing isn't the best in the series, but even the Sonic games with the best storylines had questionable gameplay and the Games with 10/10 gameplay had pretty good storylines but weren't outstanding.

It all makes sense when you realize how big of a risk this game was. SEGA and Sonic's reputation aren't what it used to be, yet they took a huge risk and changed the core structure of what defines a Sonic game. A huge gamble and even greater payoff. An absolute REBOUND towards an upwards trajectory for our favorite Blue Hedgehog. 8/10 Overall so far. Great game, good job, and keep up the good work SEGA.",,
"It's not at all perfect, but it's not too far off.a fun time filled with all the references you never expected to see acknowledged at all or ever again",,
"The open world segments kick ass, surprisingly the standard Sonic boost sections are some of the worst Sonic has ever been. A genuine 7/10, much better than Sonic Forces.",,
"A janky, but overall very fun entry into the sonic series. The best Sonic has been for a long time, and hopefully can serve as a solid foundation to future titles. Game ran very well on my mid-tier cheap laptop at 1080p 60fps, the only thing I dropped was shadow quality from high to mid and that stopped my framerate dipping to around 40fps on the second island. The pop in is real, but I dont think it ruins the experience unless you are very hung up on it. And yes, the sky is full of Spaghetti but so would the sky be in sonic adventure 2 if you could see those stages from the ground, so I think thats just an issue of a new perspective on a series that has always had weird abstract level design. Game took me 20hours to complete with the only things left to do is max out some of my stats.

All I need you to do now Sega is bring back Cream the Rabbit.",,
"Sonic Frontiers does everything right while it also casually stumbles along the way, but yet shines bright throughout the game. Its very experimental open zone gameplay has shown great direction for the future of the series while its cyberspace traditional gameplay is patched with bandaids that struggles to hold it all together.


That's not to say that it holds it back because for what it does, but because of what it tries to do. But with the open zone being the real meat and potatoes that outshines the optional stages, I had a legit blast through the game and towards the end, it became one of my favorite 3D Sonic games.

Not perfect by any means, but Sonic Frontiers is an outstanding comeback for the blue blur that has a very very solid foundation to be improved upon on.

8/10",,
"Despite some performance issues on the Deck, Frontiers is a decent open-world game and a pretty solid Sonic game.

Compared to classic 2D Sonic:
- Levels are shorter, but there are 8+ per zone
- Mechanics favor Sonic Adventure over 2D titles
- Easier, even on Hard and Fast (so far)

Compared to Adventure:
- Sonic controls even better! Movements can be combined in ways we haven't seen before, and when done properly, you never have to stop boosting.
- Levels have the same if not even greater sense of speed
- Open world areas are obviously a greater focus this time around, with hundreds of little collectibles and good design.

For sure worth it as a Sonic fan, if you are on the fence as a non-Sonic fan I can still recommend it, but wait for sale.

*Play with Japanese voices.",,
IM FRONTIERING,,
He's finally back,,
"Update 3 has made this game worse on every aspect. The game freaks out every two seconds, from the camer ato the ´controls, and the new stuff added is literal ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and almost impossible to complete.",,
"Some developer at Sega clearly just wanted to make a Bullet Hell Shooter,
And Sega were like ""Nah they don't sell well""
And then the Dev was like ""I'll show you, I'll make a whole Sonic game around a bullet hell shooter, just so you have to release it then"".

We then got Sonic Frontiers with no Chao Garden.
Where are all the Sega Devs who want to make a Chao Garden?
:(

I will recommend purely on the premise that Sega will hopefully make a Frontiers 2 where I can then raise Chao.",,
"I 100% this game on my first playthrough which took about 22 hours and boy was it fun. The 5 year wait was definitely worth it and this game is a great start for the return of the series. The visuals are amazing, the music hits hard as always, the story was solid with good writing this time around and the gameplay wasn't difficult but pretty fun to play. Finishing off this game, I really want to see more of this and I can see the next Sonic game continuing on with this and if done in a good time span with the right work, it would be really amazing.

Visuals
Starting off with the visuals, they look absolutely amazing. These are the best visuals we've gotten in a Sonic game since Unleashed and they really did this well. The textures mostly look very crisp and the detail in the environments look great with dynamic weather and time of day. The shadows being cast by the sun do jump as time progresses, but it isn't a big deal. The biggest issue I have with and the one that practically everyone is talking about is the pop-in. It is really distracting and there should have been at least some efforts to prevent this. A change in LOD or fade could've been added. Being able to change the render distance in the settings would've been even more great. On my RTX 3070 at 1440p, this game doesn't use my GPU beyond 50% so it'd be great if I were able to crank it up to render as much as possible with a smooth framerate. The graphical options are pretty mild, with only some adjustments available. The presets only are low and high and framerate is capped to 60FPS. The cutscenes are also capped to 30FPS for some reason; Not a big deal, but it did bother me. The story cutscenes do look a little low quality for me. I wasn't sure if this was the game or if I was just seeing it like that when it wasn't. The animation for them also seem to vary. In a good amount of them the character movements look great while in others it looks stiff like a fan animation. The motion blur in some scenes also adds on to this effect. In terms of animation involving gameplay, they all look great and fluid. The Super Sonic transformation animation is pretty mid and could definitely look better.


The gameplay is pretty fun and despite the combat having a lot of button mash, I find it fun pulling off different combos. I played on hard mode and some of the enemies were a challenge, and more so later on in the game. However, they weren't too hard overall and I do with they were more difficult to defeat. Would've been cool if the parry was timed (Which is what I thought when I first started just to find out it's not). All you have to do is wait for the attack and it makes it quite OP. The puzzles were fairly simple overall but did get a little tricky later in the game as well. I find it weird that there are no controller vibrations for springs, stomps, etc. Exploring in the open world environment was pretty cool. Just going around doing some platforming and getting tokens was enjoyable throughout the game for the most part for me, it did start to drag off around the end of the game at the last island for me though. The bosses around the island were cool but I do wish there was more variety and difficulty as said before. The main island bosses are FIRE. That's all I need to say for that. The leveling up system for speed and rings takes ages and should be adjustable in increments by the player. The same should be done for defense/power upgrades. Big fishing is cool as well for farming and the detail on the underwater creatures is quite something..
Cyberspace wasn't bad overall but it could've been better. They took stages from previous games which I personally didn't mind. I just wish it was something other than Green Hill, Chemical Plant, Sky Sanctuary, etc. Would've been cool to see something like Flying Battery, Wave Ocean, Adabat, etc. Sonic is also pretty slippery in it and it really shows in some stages which makes it annoyingly difficult to complete some missions.

Ian Flynn really did it this time; The story and dialogue was great this time round. In my opinion, the best we've got since Unleashed. It's nothing really complicated or amazing but I really liked the character interactions on this one with Sonic & Knuckles being my favorite. They are all portrayed well here with Knuckles is finally no longer a joke. Overall jokes are also no longer being thrown out in the dialogue commonly. The references to the previous games go crazy here and I really like seeing that as a Sonic fan; it feels good seeing things tie together. Solid story overall and it was a little darker than expected but nothing crazy or amazing to be honest.



Sonic is finally back and as long as the quality of this game is the minimal from here on out to eventually be improved upon, the future is looking really good! If you're a Sonic fan you'll definitely love it and I recommend it at it's current state. The shortcomings of the game are not hard to be overlooked and do not damper the whole experience. If you're not a Sonic fan but a gamer, I recommend waiting for a sale. I do wish there was more to do after finishing the game, but after doing everything, there isn't anything to do afterward. I give this game an 8.5/10.",,

"Edited Review after finishing The Final Horizon Update

Sonic Frontiers is the newest entry to the Sonic The Hedgehog series, and in my opinion, the BEST Sonic game out there.

I have been playing for a long time, 21 hours straight as a matter of fact. This game got me hooked from the beginning to the very end. The movement of Sonic is wonderful, the character development throughout the story is very noticeable and much appreciated! Roger did an amazing job voicing Sonic in this entry!

For 60 euro this game was entirely worth it. I enjoyed it from the beginning till the very end. If you are a returning Sonic fan, or a beginner. You should definitely check this game out. Exploring all islands and messing around with Sonic in this open zone adventure feels amazing

Update: The Final Horizon update DLC is amazing. This game is a steal while it's on sale so go get it!",,
this game will always be players' voice in my heart,,

"A good step in the right direction for the series. The open world exploration is the weakest part of the game and can get a bit monotonous, but it's still fun. The Cyber Space levels are a blast and a good bit of traditional sonic action. The story finally makes the characters more than joke and one-liner machines and I actually care about what happens. Overall, a good time and I see great potential for this formula. I look forward to seeing what future games do to refine and improve upon this.",,
"This game isn't perfect; It's definitely still flawed in quite a few ways, and could absolutely use some serious tweaking going forward with the ""Open Zone"" style of play for the franchise, but as it is, it's an incredible benchmark on where the series is headed in its future. Sonic Team cannot afford to drop what they've learned from this game's experience; They'll have to take everything they did here, in Frontiers, and make it even better in the next mainline title for it to truly bring the blue blur back to the stardom he once held.

First, the negatives;

[CAMERA] - I can't tell you how many times I had to struggle with this. The automatic camera sections didn't help, either, and only served to make it more complicated than it really had any right being. The game's got an option to have the camera follow behind Sonic ""at all times"", but this is, unfortunately, a blatant lie, as it does NOT always travel behind Sonic ""at all times"", instead just deciding to automatically re-align itself whenever it feels like it. Yeah, having a ""Center View"" button's nice, but in the heat of speeding...?

[COMBO SYSTEM] - I hate to say it, but the combo system's bare bones at best, and a complete waste of potential at worst. The Auto Combo skill makes it even more braindead, as you can simply mash the same button over and over again to win. It says the combos do ""less damage"", but that's a small price to pay for automation of any kind... It's still braindead. Yes, I'm aware it's a choice thing, but that shouldn't even be available in the hardest difficulty. In-fact, it really shouldn't be available, period. Better yet, make a better combo system worth investing time into, next time.

Speaking of difficulty...

[HARD MODE isn't actually HARD] - This always boils down to subjective bias, but typically, when you play a game at its hardest setting, you expect it to be brutal, hence the name ""Hard Mode"". Where's my Lives counter? Why do only certain attacks take all of my rings, but not all of them? Until these things are fixed, I don't know if you can really call this a genuine ""Hard Mode"". It's really more of a ""Tedious Mode"", as it simply delays the inevitable outcome of your victory, rather than actually making you work for it using your knowledge of Sonic game mechanics, and skill.

[OPEN ZONE Needs More Work] - This game's Open Zone gameplay is its defining feature, but I feel like it needs to be addressed that it's nothing exuberantly revolutionary, or even game-changing, for that matter. It's definitely got the makings to be an amazing ""Hub World"" of sorts, leading you back and forth through action-packed Sonic levels while also having cool stuff to find, and feature-rich areas to explore, but as it is, it slowly begins to become a chore, beautiful as it may be to excavate.

[MEMORY STAGES Are Extremely Uninspired in Design] - Really?... You couldn't have pulled out a few more iconic backdrops or designs for each of the Memory Stages? We see around maybe 4-5, and that's literally it. Sonic's entire franchise has almost TOO many backdrop ideas you could've went with, but you went with only the most Basic ♥♥♥♥♥ designs from the series that you could pull out. Not pleased with that one, at all.

Alright alright, I'm done with the negatives. I recommended this game, didn't I? Well, here's why, then;

[STORY] - They got the legendary Ian Flynn to help write the story, and it shows; Character interactions no longer feel painfully lifeless, or utterly unfunny. This time around, the characters you know and love actually have visible character development throughout the span of the game, not only hinting at brighter futures for each of them, but also allowing them to move on past their gimmicky pasts as merely being Sonic's ""cheerleaders"". Very well done to the writing team, and the voice cast (yes, them too) for nailing this story!

[COMBAT] - I realize I kinda trashed the Combo System earlier, but that doesn't necessarily make the combat itself mundane, or even nearly as braindead; There's something special here, and I think Sonic Team's onto something with it. The boss battles are an absolute visual treat, but also rather tough when you're not paying attention to your surroundings. Not just the bosses, the minibosses offer a lot of neat gimmicks in order to reveal their weak spots, and I'm a sucker for creative combat design. You're onto something here, guys!

[MUSIC] - Look, it's a Sonic game. Do I even need to say anything else? This album's going to slap, along with all the others.

[MECHANICS] - This is the best feeling Sonic game I've ever played; Gone are the days I feel as if I'm merely holding a button and watching Sonic do most of the work for me. Just try and boost into an enemy this time... I dare you. You'll be met with the cold slap of reality that this game absolutely obliterated the boost's power, and I couldn't be happier to see that. This not only allows Sonic's movement to feel more controlled, but also less like it's Sonic controlling me, and more like me controlling Sonic. It's wonderful. Master his moveset, and you're going to be ecstatic to realize that all this awesome precision is all because of your skill as a Sonic player.

[PROGRESSION] - The methods of progression go 2 ways in this game; Exploration and Fishing. You could just go straight into the game and find everything yourself, but if you're wanting to try and get everything quickly so that you can experience the game's best parts, thanks to the game's Falling Stars event, you can use your Purple Coins to fish and stock up on a whole lot of Fish Coins. This minigame's painfully easy, allowing you to obtain these coins fairly easily. Why am I putting this here as a positive, and not a negative? Because it's completely optional. You don't HAVE to do things this way if you don't wish to. I'm a sucker for games with options, and being able to change my methodology of progression midway through a game is always a welcome change. I almost wish there were more minigames like this, so that progression felt even more varied.

[OVERALL] - Sonic Frontiers isn't exactly the life-saving game that Sonic dreadfully needs, but it's one big giant step in the right direction towards that event; It's a solid game, and you'll get plenty of fun out of it if you give it the time of day, leaving your harsh judgement of all Sonic games at the door for just one title. This game feels experimental, but that doesn't make it a bad game, it just makes it a game worth playing so that you can see what good the franchise is truly capable of if given the time to do so. This game's absolutely not winning any awards, and that's okay, because Sonic Team knows now what works. Take what they learned from this game, and the next one could easily be Sonic's life-saving title. Until then, I'm very pleased with what we got!

[P.S.] - This may be fixed at some point, but as of writing this review, a major bug with graphical ""pop-ins"" occurred a LOT during my playthrough. Sonic's physics on climbable walls sometimes makes him go downwards, instead of upwards, which was a serious problem for me in some places. I overcame this issue through sheer will, but that last problem absolutely NEEDS to be fixed, because not everyone's going to have the patience for it. The camera... I already mentioned it, but while it can't exactly be fully reworked, it does need a bit of placement tweaking.",,
"After over a month of playing this game for a while, my opinions MOSTLY stays the same. Unlike my previous review, this one will in fact go a bit more in depth on the aspects of the game. Spoiler warning. Sonic Frontiers is bad. Just kidding, it’s good. It’s actually good at it’s core. After our ROL, Lost world, forces, ultimate, and origins; we actually got a good sonic game. However, SEGA needs to be a better company and allow the Devs to have the resources they need. Sonic Team literally made an AAA game for an AA company. Sonic Team actually cares, and most of the issues in this game are SEGA’s fault. Intro over, let’s actually talk about the game. First off, the gameplay. Open Zone gameplay is still very fun. The controls are mostly good. The physics aren’t perfect, but solid. Air/roll turning is a bit of an issue. More momentum would help as well, other than that; the game makes you feel like Sonic. You can adjust the controls a bit that helps. Sonic goes decently fast, he turns good, and his homing attack is okay. There is a bit of a delay on it though, but it isn’t that huge of an issue HERE. Mapping it to X helps as well. Boosting is basically a run, but with more functions. RT is a good mapping for this. You can air dash as well if you touched the floor. Yeah sadly, you can’t do it off springs and such. But it’s still fun. Despite not turning good, drop-dash is still fun to use. Implementing momentum is fun there. The open zone just needs more… momentum. That’s all it really needs to make it perfect plus the air steering. Combat is fun too. It’s simple. Which is all it needs to be. The skill tree is smol as well. However, there is a certain mod that makes it better. We’ll talk about those later. The quarter of the game, cyberspace, is bad. The physics sucks. Sonic is slow there, which is an issue because a lot of the levels take level design from the boost games in which Sonic casually goes at Mach 2 but who cares. The boost steering also sucks because you can’t steer at all. Yeah, screw controls and the fact that the open zone controls but faster would work fine, but why have that? We can have bad controls. Also, the homing delay is literally intolerable here. It ruins speedruns. It’s way too slow. The level design is reused from previous games. Have I told you the themes? They are Green Hell, (I intended to spell it that way), Chemically bad Plant, Sky Sanctions, and City Level. City Level is fine, but Green Hill? No. Why? ACTUAL CYBERSPACE THEME WITH THE OUTLINED SQUARES WOULD WORK BETTER. Now I get it for Sonic Team, they didn’t have enough people to make new assets for stages. SEGA should have hired more men for Sonic Team. I remember what LS mark said would work for Cyberspace level design, mismatching assets together. Meaning that the level design is just assets from previous games just mismatched together to form one stage. That would be actual fun. However, this is actually Sonic Team’s fault because it would have been easy. They just used the entire stage design from previous games. Yes. We got Widmill Isle Green Hill edition now. I’d give this part an C because it gets better later on. Oh yeah. The first two islands are the best ones. Chaos is good, but a bit hard to navigate. Fourth Island is non-existent. Fifth is inflated as hell. You need a lot of tokens there. And three of them have the same theme. Kronos, Rhea, and Ouranos were meant to be combined, however SEGA, instead of delaying the game, decided that they should split the islands. What. The. Hell. The bosses in this game are the best parts no doubt. IM HANGING ON TO THE OTHER SI- oops. Sorry, got a little exited. They are just pure hype, the metal tracks, you just using the games combat to beat the crap out of them. That’s a chef’s kiss right there. Except the final. The music is good, but the gameplay, not so much. The first phase is Giganto, and the second is just a shooter mini game? Thank god that’s being fixed later. Yep. Mario Kishimoto decided to respond to a tweet about the finale boss improvement ideas. Thank you. Mario Kishimoto is a chad. Tikashi Izuka is also good. Most of Sonic’s flop isn’t his fault. Except for Sonic 4 and Sonic Boom, and maybe Forces. It’s literally the publisher’s corporate greed. Sega just wants money, that’s all. Back on topic, you just beat up all the titans, do some cool ass stuff, and then obliterate them.",,
"Alright, lets get cooking. Sonic Frontiers is probably one of my favorite 7-8/10 games out there. The game is absolutely janky, and there are some flaws. However the overall structure is so full of life and love from Sonic Team. You can see this with the continued FREE updates they put out, and I believe that for the most part, they stuck the landing, launching Sonic into a potentially new era for the Hedgehog.

To start:
Pop in is rampant, which isn't fun. Textures literally load as you play, this was NEVER an issue for me during playtime, but other people had it so it has to be mentioned. I don't think it's as big as people make it seem, but for a full price game, you should expect more loading without pop in, so totally get that.

Combat is fun, but a little flawed too, it's very flashy, but the optimal combos just devolve into doing the same thing over and over and over again, which people might not necessarily like or want. My recommendation is to go with the flow, and FEEL how badass the game wants you to be. What I discovered is that the more you let Frontiers cook, the better your overall experience will be.

Story: Maybe one of the best we've gotten in a Sonic game, the character writing here is PHENOMENAL, the base game ending, kinda sucks I'm not gonna lie, but with Final Horizon, it becomes a much more satisfying piece. (even despite some of the now fixed issues with Final Horizon). Ian Flynn did a fantastic job connecting this world with the rest of the Team, and they made you feel rewarded for even remotely caring and going out of your way to interact with Fishing for the logs. Sage is a character that they introduced in this game and I'll say she's an immediate fan favorite to me at least.

Movement:
My god did they nail it. ""Open Zone"" was a phrase that really confused and worried me a little when I first heard it, but the movement is fluid, and it feels so good. Especially with the addition of the Spindash. There are some instances in which the physics just, don't work, but very rare in my experience.


Overall, I think Frontiers was such a promising project, and I was super happy to be here from the start to its conclusion. It wasn't perfect, and it still isn't, but what it shows is that Sonic Team is more passionate than ever, and they put everything into impressing us all. (End credits song is meant to be a thank you to the fans for being here).

If i had to be objective, 6-7/10, its fun, with some major flaws that keep it. But if I had to be COOL and AWESOME 9/10, I just loved my time with the game so so much, and I have so very minimal complaints. (Except the 3rd island ♥♥♥♥ that place)> Sonic team did a phenomenal job I think, and I think this game deserves the praise it gets. It's put in the work to earn it.",,
"Just 100% Completed Sonic Frontiers, And It's A Very Good Sonic Game. This Game Completely Wipes The Floor On Sonic Forces Which, Personally, I REALLY Didn't Like. The Pros: The Game Runs Well, Soundtrack's GOATED, Sage Is ALSO GOATED, The Combat Is Fun, Enemy Designs Are Awesome, The Story Is One Of The Best In The Series And Even Makes References To Past Games Like Sonic Unleashed For Sonic Fans Who Like Sonic Lore, Voice Acting Is Great And Characters Are Expressive, And The Graphics Look Nice, The Exploration Of The Islands Is Fun, And The Sonic Controls The Best He's Probably Ever Has. Now, The Cons: Combat Is Quite Janky But It's Not A ""Bad"" Kinda Janky, The Combat Also Gets Repetitive Quite Fast Because Sonic Also Doesn't Have A Broad Moveset Either Which (I Already Had Like 1/2 Of The Moveset Unlocked On The First Island), The Cyber Space Levels (For The Most Part) REUSE Old Level Designs From PAST Games Which I Find Very Lazy But Could Probably Be Fixed In Sonic Team's Next Game Or In Future DLC They've Planned, In Cyber Space Sonic Controls Worse Than He Does On The Islands For Some Reason Which Made It A Tad Bit Harder To Control And Platform, The Puzzles Are Not Hard To Only A Select Few MAYBE, Game Was Quite Easy Aswell I Was Playing On The Hardest Difficulty... Which Would Be ""Hard"" Mode, Pop-In Is Bad Not Even Like A Fade-In Pop-in Effect Which Gets Distracting, And The Enemy Types/Variety Get Reused With Just Different Colors And Names. Now Probably The Maybe's/Nitpicks: No TRUE Momentum The Game Has A ""Speedometer"" But It's Use Isn't Really Put Into Full Effect Which Means Sonic Doesn't Lose Or Gain Speed That Much (It's SO Slight And VERY Insignificant) Going Up Hill Or Down Hill, I Think Sonic's Animations In Gameplay Are Very Stiff And Janky-Looking Compared To Previous Games Like Sonic Generations/Unleashed Which Had WAY Better Animations (This Game Uses Sonic's ""Sonic Forces"" Model, So They Just Ripped That With The Animations To.) Well, That Should Be It For This Review, ENJOY THE GAME!!!",,

"I am probably one of THE biggest Sonic fans, so this may be bias, but this game really IS deserving of Game Of The Year. If not that, it has made one of the BIGGEST U-Turns in gaming history. After the heavily flawed Sonic Forces dropped, us fans were devastated. But once this game dropped, the expectations were blown out of the water. The fact that his game has been given NO love for any musical awards is downright absurd. The Titan themes are some of the biggest bops in the franchise as a whole. Not to mention the regular Cyberspace stages were amazing too.

In the end, Sonic Frontiers is a great game, and an AMAZING game if you've been a Sonic fan. Here's to SEGA riding this momentum and making us fans proud.",,
"Sonic is back.

Frontiers is a step into the right direction for this franchise. After so many years, sonic is back with a sped-action-based game that combines, even when it has its own flaws.
We can say that this is the best game we had of Sonic since the Adventure Era, featuring a beautiful story, breathtaking music, and fun mechanics.


It's been a long since we had a sonic in 3D that controls this smoothly. Running around the islands at full speed, discovering the secrets of the world and solving very fun puzzles is satisfying. Sonic hasn't felt this good since Sonic Generations, but most importantly, Sonic hasn't felt this free since the Adventure Era.
You run across the islands in the way you want. Wanna try and fight the enemies without any upgrades? Wanna solve puzzles and platform challenges at full speed in the order you want? You can do it here.
The physics of a running sonic have been upgraded, not at its fullest since there's some hardware details that could be better if this game had 3 or 6 months of more development, but even with those flaws, it feels smooth.


The world is well designed for sonic, you can run long dunes in a Desert biome, you can climb mountains and run across beautiful grasslands and forests as much as you want, if you can see it, it is possible that you can run in top of it.
The biggest problem with a huge world designed like this is the quality of the visuals here. Some parts of the first and third island feel weak. Since this game shows you the entirety of the world, the long distances are rendered poorly, making it look like a game from the older generation, this also works for some parts of the game where you can see that this game needed at least 6 months to one year of more work to polish this things.
This also fits the animations, in some parts of the game, the animations of certain characters feel stiff and robotic, which is unacceptable in a modern game.
Even with those flaws, some parts of the game, specially in the Second and Fifth island left me with the mouth open. Beautiful structures, cool textures for sand and grass, unique and melancholic atmosphere, particles that are too good that it made me wonder if this was a sonic game, etc.
This kind of designs made me notice that this game wanted to be more huge, in terms of graphics, but it needed more work.


The special zones of this game. Since Sonic The Hedgehog for the Mega Drive, sonic has implemented a set of minigames known as Special Zones, Zones dedicated to gain extra points or to obtain powerful gimmicks.
This time the special zone comes in form of the traditional Sonic Boost Gameplay, bringing old level designs in a time-based experience like in the past games of the franchise, excluding Sonic Lost World.
The physics in this part is the worst part of the zones, there are parts where all the momentum is lost and sonic just stops when he's supposed to fly or run.
Overall they're fun, and challenging if you wanna S-Rank them.


It is common knowledge that Sonic always has the best music, even in its weakest games, but this time Tomoya Othani decided to create one of the best soundtracks of the year by mixing beautiful instrumentals, that use real instruments based in the area we are playing, EDM, and the classic Rock that has accompanied sonic since its origins in the Dreamcast.
The music of the open zone is beautiful and melancholic, and fits perfectly with the situiation. The first and last islands give you the feeling of hurry and melancholy, the perfect feeling to describe how Sonic is feeling. The second and third island givee this aura of mysticism, thanks to the multiple exposition shown during the cutscenes and conversations with characters.
But the most impressive work in the soundtrack is the music that plays during the boss fights. Those battles feature the best music we had in this franchise. And it's sonic, the bar it's too high, to top amazing Soundtracks like Sonic Unleashed, Sonic Adventure 2 and Sonic Colors is hard, but Sonic Frontiers did it.


From now on, I will talk about parts of the game that contain story and mechanic spoilers.
If you don't want to see this part, skip to the conclusion to see my final words about this game and if I recommend it or not.


Ian Flynn took everything that made Sonic great back in the 2000s, combined it with the modern approach of sonic, and made a beautiful story, the kind of story we haven't seen since Sonic Unleashed, Sonic Battle and Sonic Adventure 1 and 2.
The amount of lore and exposition to the of Sonic The Hedgehog exceeded my expectations.
Combine this with a beautiful dance of Melancholy, self-improvement, anger and dispear, and you'll have one of the coolest stories in the franchise.
The ending made the sensitive me cry, and after a long time, makes you feel empathy over Eggman, the enemy.


After decades of having a sonic that doesnt take itself seriously, an Amy with nothing else but her love at sonic, a weak and coward Tails, and a stupid Knuckles. Ian flynn and SEGA decided to take all those wrongs that the franchise has been doing in the past decade and give it a full redemption.
This is the first game in years that takes its characters seriously, specially Tails, who is determined to even go trough his own path, decided to one day surpass Sonic.


Super sonic was nothing but a final boss thing and even like that it never felt powerful and worthy of respect in the gameplay. But this changes in Sonic Frontiers.
The boss fights feature super sonic in a epic way that we haven't seen in this franchise before, accompanied with the best music that this franchise has ever delivered and epic mechanics that make Super Sonic feel powerful and smooth.
The best part of this game, those boss fights are so cool that even the weakest boss of those, the fourth one, leaves the bar too high for future sonic games in terms of Boss fights.


Even with the multiple flaws that are unacceptable for modern standards in gaming, Sonic Frontiers delivers the greatest experience we had since Sonic Generations.
Sonic Frontiers takes the best of the Classic, Dreamcast, and modern era and mixes it into a cool game that is fun and sets the bar high for future games.
If I have to give it a title, I would name Sonic Frontiers ""The Sonic 1 of the new generation"" setting the bases for future sonic games and returning Sonic to its old glory.

Pros:
- Features beautiful scenarios in certain moments.
- Good and fun gameplay.
- Challenging zones and enemies.
- Fun puzzles and gimmicks
- Beautiful Story.
- Amazing characters.
- Epic and beautiful music.
- Beautiful artstyle.
- Supports mods.

Cons:
- Hardware problems like popping.
- Lack of smooth animations in certain moments.
- Can be repetitive at moments.
- Weird particles.
- Physics that need more work, specially in the cyberspace.
- Lack of a Boss rush mode and replay value.
- Uses Denuvo.

A solid 8.5/5,
a 7.5 for the steam version since it has Denuvo.

If they ever fix the problems in the graphics and hardware related issues, a 9/10.

I would not buy it at this price range tho, I recommend to get it with a discound, or when the price drops in some time.

Sonic is back, and the little child in me loved it, after following the franchise since Sonic Battle released, and watching it fall, it makes so happy to see it back to its own glory, so happy that I cried :)",,

Nyanco's Review : 
+ Experience Sonic running in an open world! ヽ(´• ω •`)、

Sonic Frontiers is an action adventure game published by SEGA and developed by Sonic Team. This is one of the first main line Sonic games made since Sonic Forces. There are a lot of things we do like about Sonic itself, but honestly recent Sonic games needed a hell of a lot more love than what was given. This new title Sonic Frontiers takes the open world as a new challenge for the Sonic series. How about it? Let's take a look with Nyanco-chan!

While the game says it features an open-world, it's really more of an open “zone” of sorts as the development team noted. The reason is that other AAA games express the open-world in a way that adds RPG and adventure elements to said open world, but the open “zone” from the setting of Sonic Frontier transforms the entire game world into a kind of open action platforming adventure. The game has a UI interface and skill tree designed to fit the open world game genre, and the interactions are similar to open world games as well. However, advanced cutscenes and in-game directing effects are okay.

The devs seem to have learned some lessons from the last Sonic titles. A good Sonic game is not made with high speed alone, but only when secondary elements such as story and level design are harmonized with the main high speed mechanic to achieve a higher level of perfection. Obviously, this is different from the existing entries in the Sonic series. Still, it's welcome to experience Sonic's adventures in this kind of open world as it contains several homages and outstanding elements referencing other various Sonic titles. Not only will new users be able to experience this game positively but also old-fans will be able to play this new title with pleasure. Recommended!",,
"Good game, but they should added sex.",,
"It's good. Play it. Cyberspace is mid but tolerable and everything else is amazing. 9/10 overall.

Oh btw if you like Sonic CD you're gonna love this game and also be insanely cracked at it.",,
"I really enjoyed the game! So happy to see some fresh mechanics and gameplay.

Sonic Frontiers brings back things I missed from Sonic Adventure like the open areas where you are free to explore and run, outside the platforming/linear stages. The story is good and it feels like they're trying to focus more on each character background and personality and the fishing minigame was a small surprise ^^

Besides, the OST is the best I've heard in years. Really amazing work there.

I've seen some new content coming next year such as photomode, new challenges, playable characters and new story. Looking forward to seeing that!",,
"Those early trailers from IGN truly did this game a disservice. This right here is the most fun I've had with a Sonic game in roughly 20 years. At the moment I'm only on the second island, but they absolutely succeeded in creating an open world that you just wanna get lost in. Some of the Cyberspace levels are among the best stages in a boost-styled Sonic game, even though most are remakes of past stages using assets from Generations.. Combat isn't difficult at all, but it is incredibly fun. And the writing, oh my god the writing. At long last, a Sonic game with a serious story again. And leave it to Ian Flynn to fill this game with small references to past games, from the Genesis and Adventure titles, to more recent games like Team Sonic Racing. Without a doubt in my mind, this is a must-buy for any Sonic fans.",,
"In the old days sega loved experimenting with sonic, each game had a new gimmick, however when they made forces they played it soooooo safe that the game ended up being a bland mediocre collection of 1 minute levels with a story that tried to be something serious but ended up making 0 sense with a lot of plot holes.
However with frontiers, for the first time in my life I am playing a sonic game where I am not cringing at the story. The idea of an open world sonic game always sounded like a dream to me, I absolutely love everything about this game, sega really went all out with this one. You can tell when playing the game how much effort was put into making it, giant islands, lots of secrets, side quests, THE KOCOS ARE ADORABLE, boss fights feel engaging and fun for the first time in a while thanks to sonic's new moveset.
I have not finished the game yet but my only problems are the cyberspace levels feeling a but slow and sluggish at times, and sometimes being recycled lvls from generations or forces, and that the speed + ring cap lvl mechanic takes sooooo long to happen since you can only go up 1 level at a time, a skip feature here would be great.

Yeah so overall, really fresh and new experience for sonic, a serious yet mysterious story that's engaging keeping me asking questions (mostly about sage because she's so mysterious) and a game that will go down in history for being one of the best sonic games in decades.",,
"Subverted my expectations entirely, so far the game has been a lovely experience with plenty to do. The combat is fun and satisfying. Overall a good experience, certainly better than Forces.",,
"Product received for free

eh the game isn't great but it's ok and it's pretty fun the ending is pretty cool ok have a great day",,
the only way this game could be better was if it sucked me off,,
"I just finished this game and 100% completed it. There are many things I felt when I played this game, this brought me back to when Sonic felt like Sonic. They did it, they brought Sonic and his friends back to where they should be. The story, the gameplay, the music, it's all spectacular. Thank you Sonic Team, I hope to see more of this in the future.",,
"Must we judge Sonic games on whether they meet some arbitrary standard of Good or Bad? Is it not enough to Go Fast and listen to great music? Does the fishing minigame mean nothing to you? It means everything to me.

Frontiers is definitely in my top 3 favourite Sonic games. I love the exploration, solving the little map puzzles is super fun to me and I love being rewarded for all my poking around by uncovering more pieces of the story. It took me a few tries to beat the first island's final boss, but that mini intro cutscene when the music kicks in never once got old or failed to get me hyped up. Yes, the overworld plays near identically to Breath of the Wild's (there's even a ""blood moon"" reset event), but I don't feel that's necessarily a bad thing. The minibosses are fun to fight, and I like that each one has its own set of mechanics. The environments are expansive without being overwhelming, and given the tone of the story I think they look great.

If I had to pick one thing to criticise, it's that the grind rails on the overworld often give the impression that something has failed to render, but when you take into consideration the whole Cyber Space vs Reality thing that's an easy enough gripe to ignore.

I hope we see more Sonic games like Frontiers in the future. If this is the direction the franchise is taking then I am here for it.",,
Breath of the Wild on Speed.,,

"Honestly, when I saw the initial gameplay demo for Frontiers, I was convinced I was gonna pass on what I was assuming to be another mediocre 3D Sonic game. But as more and more of the game was shown off, I became more and more curious, and now that the game is finally out and I've played through it, I can say it was worth the purchase for me and I am so happy to see and play what I feel is a pretty good Sonic game.

The game is not perfect or even close to being perfect, but it is enjoyable and there's a lot to enjoy. The main draw is probably what was also the biggest selling point in the game's marketing, the ""Open Zone"" areas. They're a JOY to blast process my way through and just get lost in. Sonic's control and momentum aren't EXACTLY ideal, but they're still really good. If Sonic had just a bit more weight to his movement and didn't stop basically on a dime and magnet to the floor a lot, I think it would be perfect, but what we have is still pretty solid.

The cyberspace levels were... Passable? I was a little disappointed in the limited tilesets, but I was excited to see some of the level aesthetics from early 3D Sonic make a return for this. The 3D levels in general were all pretty fine, but the 2D ones were... Just straight up mediocre. I genuinely think it's time for Sonic Team to stop forcing 3D Sonic into 2D settings. Nothing about them feels right, and it always feels like something is missing.

Fishing is fishing. I don't actually enjoy fishing much in games, but the QTE for it here is... Serviceable. And it's a nice way to farm up your stats for when you're going for 100%

The boss fights are the highlight imho and the combat in general is just a straight upgrade over every 3D Sonic that tried to handle combat like Heroes and Shadow the Hedgehog (or Shadow's story in '06). Not to mention the boss themes go raw af.

The story is probably the best we've gotten in a 3D Sonic game, period. Sure there's a little bit of a reliance on ""OMG HE SAID THE THING I REMEMBER BECAUSE I PLAYED THAT GAME TOO"" and to someone new to the series, some of the references or callbacks can probably come off as alienating. However, there is so much care placed in it and Ian Flynn did SUCH a good job with the writing on this one that I legit would not have a problem with him taking the helm for 3D Sonic stories going forward.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my time playing Sonic Frontiers. If you're a bit stingy with your wallet, I wouldn't blame you for not wanting to drop a full $60 on this game. Really I think only Sonic fans eager to play the game should drop that kind of money on it, but I would definitely recommend you pick it up, as I don't think you NEED to be a Sonic fan to enjoy this.",,
Gotta go fast,,
"20 years later, a proper Sonic Adventure 3 is finally here.",,
They did it. The crazy bastards did it. They made a good 3D Sonic game again.,,
mario is in this game,,
"The best sonic game in a long time, definitely up there with Generations and Unleashed. We're definitely in the good timeline, The controls in the open zone is really great! Really hoped Cyberspace atleast had the same controls, The game's a 9/10 would highly recommend. Sonic is back baby!

Edit: Final Boss was kinda disappointing ngl",,
"If you've ever liked 3D sonic games, this is the best one. This game will have you feeling like Tony Hawk when you quickly react to rails and obstacles chaining them together for a smooth run. The soundtrack has a ton of variety with some house and EDM tracks along with some metal for the bosses. The graphical pop-in and sometimes janky situations are bad but they didn't detract from the constant amount of fun I was having.",,
"Sonic the Hedgehog. One of the greatest and most attractive characters ever thought up. He can run at sound speed, take out enemies in a flash, and best of all, he's blue colored and knows how to handle the females. Speaking of females, the Sonic universe might also be classified as ""Hot Chick Heaven"" because there's such a mess of very beautiful and tough women that it will make you love the franchise even more! And since Valentine's Day is around the corner, I've been inspired to make a top 10 list of the most beautiful female Sonic characters. Grab yourself a snack and a glass of orange juice, and try not to reach through the screen because HERE WE GO!

10: Try this question on for size. Who chases and hugs Sonic all the time and wields a powerful hammer? Why it's Amy Rose of course! Though more of a cutie than a hottie, you can't deny the fact that she's still attractive. Two things that make her attractive are the fact that she wears a dress, and when have you ever seen 3 big, very smooth arcs of hair sticking out of a person's forehead? I haven't! So once again, Amy Rose is lovely; that is until she goes berserk and starts hitting stuff with her hammer.

Who's at number 9? It's this alien plant girl from a distant planet. Cosmo, from Sonic X. She arrived on the character's planet to deliver a message saying that the galaxy was under attack by a force called the Metarex. She doesn't do much except tell people to stop fighting and focus on the real matter at hand. The real reason she lands at the #9 is that she becomes Miles ""Tails"" Prower's sweetheart, something Tails needed for a long while.

Numero Ocho. Cream the Rabbit's mother, Vanilla. She's attractive and the size of an average human mother. What really surprises me about her is that the leader of Team Chaotix, Vector the Crocodile, falls in love with her. Kinda silly, don't you think? She's another character that doesn't do much, but in a season 3 episode of Sonic X, she helps Chris Thorndyke get into space to fight the Metarex along with Sonic and friends.

What number's next? Seven, of course. Wave the Swallow from Sonic Riders. People always root for the good guys, but sometimes, the bad guys steal the show. Her mechanical IQ is equal to Tails. She also happens to be the smartest member of the Babylon Rogues. I wonder why she isn't the leader. Like Jet the Hawk and Storm the Albatross, her specialty is riding the air-boards called ""Extreme Gear"". With two very long and smooth feathers extending from her head to her calves and droopy eyes, Wave will rock your socks. If only we could see her take wing.

Numero Six. Tikal the Echidna from Sonic Adventure 1. Named after an ancient Mayan city of the same name, Tikal is the daughter of Chief Pachacamac. She's yet another character that hardly does a thing except beg her father to stop being so greedy. She also traps herself inside the Master Emerald so that the water god Chaos doesn't reign terror upon the land. When you're the daughter of a person in the highest power, you need to look your best and Tikal delivers perfectly. That's why she's #6

Number #1, #2, #3, #4, #5! Ah-Ah-Ahhh! Mina Mongoose from the Sonic Archie comics. How could you go wrong with a girl that looks like this? She can run nearly as fast as Sonic and she went from being a Freedom Fighter to being a popstar singer. Next to Princess Sally she looks more humanoid than the other characters. Who could top someone who has long mauv hair?

This female standing at number 4: Blaze the Cat. One word: Pyrokinesis. How would you like to have that superpower? I mean Blaze could play around in the Himalayas for hours and she would be perfectly fine! Also, 45 degree ponytail makes her look like a Native American. I really like the fact that her love interest is the telekinetic hedgehog Silver. The combination of mind-moving and fire superpowers make these two a reliable couple. But what really lands Blaze in the #4 spot is that her attitudes apparently more different from the other females.

Next up is #3. What's better than having a female with cascading quills? How about a female with cascading quills and hair? Julie-Su the Echidna, another Archie comic exclusive has that feature. She's smart, knows exactly what to do as a freedom fighter, and even trained Amy once. She's also the girl of Knuckles' dreams. Heh, lucky him. Her older self in the series Mobius: X Years Later is just downright hot! Just look at that long ponytail! Now we're talkin'!

1, 2, button my shoe! Princess Sally Acorn. There's a lot to say about this character. She's the heir to the throne, Sonic's first official romance, the only character that used to not wear clothes, brave and athletic, the most humanoid character, and is like a mother to Tails. In the TV show, Sonic SatAM, one Freedom Fighter, the cowardly Antoine constantly tries to woo Sally, but doesn't succeed because... he's a coward! The Princess is also a semi-perfect example of an excellent love interest, although there were a couple of times when she really snapped and acted like a lunatic; in the comics, that is. But overall, Sally Acorn really stands out amongst the slew of females not just because she's Sonic's first official love interest, or because she's the only one who didn't wear clothes, but because in the comics, she grew very long hair, and married Sonic in the future, becoming the Queen.

So, you've seen a pyrokinetic Cat, a swallow, two gorgeous echidnas, and even a princess! Who could possibly top those kinds of females? Well, get ready folks; this is the #1 hottest Sonic the Hedgehog female character. Rouge the Bat. If anybody denies it, how dare you? This woman can fly, she's as strong as Knuckles, and is a femme fatale, seducing other characters into getting what she wants. Instead of having one love interest, she has two! Knuckles, and Shadow the Hedgehog. Being a treasure thief, she's only interested in one object set; jewels, especially the Chaos Emeralds. There actually have been situations where Rouge's cleavage has been exposed, but it eventually got censored. What a price to pay. I think the best part about this beauty is that she wears three different outfits unlike the other female characters. And who wouldn't want to fly across the landscape via strong as Shawn Johnson, and flirt with any male, anytime, anywhere. These three traits make Rouge the Bat triumph over all of the Sonic the Hedgehog females. My hat goes off to you Sonic Team USA. You oughta be proud.

There ya have it folks. Those were the hottest female chicks in the Sonic universe. I hope you enjoyed it, happy Valentine's Day

"For anyone new to sonic this game is probably a 6 or 7 out 10,
but if you're a fan of the series this game is a 9 if not a 10.
There's some small issues and bugs that I encountered
but its overshadowed by just how many things the game does right.

Super Sonic is absolutely RAW.",,
"Another janky broken game from Sonic Team.

People pretend it's good because it isn't garbage like Lost World or Forces The only reason it's not garbage is because it's open world. Running around the world as Sonic is fun, so people ignore all the issues.

But the truth is that this game is very poorly designed. Everything is janky and barely functional, the animations are terrible, it has an incredibly bad combat system that you're forced to use to progress. The cyber space stages feel like they haven't been tested, they're either too hard or way too easy.

You're supposed to collect things by completing platforming puzzles or other kinds of puzzles, but so much of it can be skipped thanks to Sonic's mobility allowing him to just jump straight to collectables without doing it the intended way.

The main objective of the game is to collect stuff to unlock cyber stages and emeralds so you can fight a titan. You repeat this for four island. You also collect kocos and attack/defense upgrades to level yourself up. There is no reward for collecting everything and I never felt the need to collect everything as emeralds were unlocked very quickly.

The story is okay. Better than recent games but that's only because it relies heavily on nostalgia, referencing almost every game and trying to fix plot holes. Sage is a good new character and Dr Eggman feels more developed than ever before. But overall, the story feels unsatisfying as nothing much happens, too much time establishing lore and not enough action and the ending is just a rip-off of SA2's ending. But the worst part about the story is that it seems to think that everything is canon, including non-canon shows like Sonic Boom that take place in different universes.

I had fun with this game but I just can't tolerate Sonic Team's lack of quality control. This game is good despite the jank, but that doesn't mean the jank should be forgiven.",,
"***NO SPOILER REVIEW***

This will never be the best Sonic game, but it will forever be the Sonic game that brought back hope to the community for many.

This game is not perfect or feels finished by any means. It needs work and fixing, but I think that this time that's actually a good thing. Many things are very much not finished: the obvious pop-ins, the weird physics, Cyberspace feeling slow and sticky, the story pacing at times, the world sometimes feels a bit lackluster in versatility, the forced notifications or camera pans towards enemies and so on, but this will all help Sega going forward. They will learn and understand from these mistakes and (hopefully) grow and adapt solutions for these.

Looking beyond the flaws of the game, you can feel that they genuinely tried their best to make something more worthwhile to play: first proper open world Sonic game, more intricate combat system, a story that feels like it's inspired by Unleashed and the Adventure games (thank you, Ian Flynn), characters that no longer feel flat, a kick ass OST that (most of the time) absolutely slaps HARD AF, bosses that hype you up and feel exciting to fight against, exploration that always has your attention, a world that feels like it has emotion and expression with a nice aesthetic and many more of said good details. It feels like we're back in the early 2000's of Sonic. It's not perfect, but we're having a good 'ol time with our buddy Sonic again.

I could not possibly recommend this to someone who is not a Sonic fan. Even more so, I feel like this game is not meant to be played by a larger audience than the Sonic fandom (even if they promote otherwise). It feels more like they are trying to apologize to us, the Sonic community, for their past mistakes. They want to walk away from the disaster that was Forces, and follow this new direction they took with Frontiers, and I think that's a really good thing.

At the time of writing this review, the Steam store page says 'Overwhelmingly Positive' with about 6000 reviews, and that to me is very beautiful. Since the day the first teaser dropped, everyone was scared that Sega messed up once more. 'Here comes the Sonic cycle again'. But here we are, about a week after release, and even though many of us are still conflicted and confused on what to think about Frontiers, we can all confidently say that Sega, in fact, did not mess up, and that we got a Sonic game we have all been waiting for for a very long time.

It's far from perfect, it's far from the best Sonic game, but I'm sure we can all agree that beyond it's flaws, it's a damn good Sonic game.

Let's just hope Sega keeps their promise and keeps improving their quality going forward into this new decade of Sonic.",,
"So far, the game is really fun. It's about collecting a lot of stuff throughout the open world but what ties the game together is Sonic's control, he feels wonderful in this game.",,

"It definitely has its fair share of problems: Issues with the camera, immense pop-in, 60 fps cap (which can easily be modded out, but must be turned off at certain moments as it breaks a lot of the physics), low resolution cutscenes (clearly this was a bare minimum PC port, but can also be fixed with mods). However, this is one of the most enjoyable open world platform games I have played in awhile. While I am not sure how it stands as a Sonic game, as I haven't played many, I would say if you are a fan of collect-a-thons, you will find this game enjoyable. The story was endearing, and the different worlds were fun to explore.",,
"Wow... just wow. This game has been something I've been waiting for for a long time now. I remember when the game was first announced, I wasn't excited for it at all because I wanted to keep my expectations low after the disappointment that was Sonic Forces. Now all I want to do is go back in time and congratulate myself for doing that because this game didn't just reach my low expectations, it hit them full force and shattered them so hard that I had a smile on my face for most of the game.

The Good
Sonic is an absolute blast to control in this game. He's FINALLY responsive to your controls which I felt has always been an issue with the Boost Formula since it first came out and he has an interesting combat system that allows him to take down enemies in the game. They also gave new direction and a better script for Sonic's VA, Roger Craig Smith which he sounds sooo much better than he did in previous games. I actually LIKE his take on Sonic now and while I'm still bias and prefer Ryan Drummond, Jason Griffith, & the movie voice Ben Schwartz, I can't WAIT to see what Roger does with the character now if they keep this direction. Sonic music is also, once again, in great abundance here! The minigames, from the different Challenges to Big's Fishing were also very fun too! Finally, the little details from Sonic's animations, to seagulls travelling in your gust of wind... it all added to making a great experience! :)

The Bad
If I had to criticize anything about this game, it would have to be when you're not in the open-world and are instead doing stages... the physics are pretty bad and for some reason, the developers have decided to LITERALLY REUSE MODELS & SOME LAYOUTS FROM SONIC GENERATIONS! I sort of get what they were going for here because in the story: , but it kind of comes off as lazy. Thankfully though, this is not the focus of the game as the focus is all about open-world which has better physics and is mostly original (with some models taken from previous Sonic games). People also complained about the open-world having too much stuff flying around it, but I particularly never minded this. Personally, might be a hot take, but Sonic games in general (even up to the original back in 1991), I felt have always had flying stuff everywhere that really had no rhyme or reason. It's a PLATFORMER, flying stuff is just natural in these games and if you're complaining about it ruining immersion or whatever, then it's not just a Sonic-thing... it's a platformer thing and it exists in Mario, Kirby, etc.. Now, one thing I will admit though is that the flying stuff generally seem to not have a point. You go on them to collect things called memory tokens, but you can literally cut to the middle or the end of it, bypassing most, if not all of it, rendering it a bit pointless. As a best of both worlds, the devs could implement an easy fix should they try to make an open-world game like this again where the flying stuff disappears after you collect the memory token with maybe an option to bring it all back once you've beaten them all.

Now while my expectations were shattered, there was some disappointment near the end, particularly when I reached Islands 4 & 5. They're both practically the same environment as Island 1. Island 4 has basically nothing in it which surprised the heck out of me considering how big it still is and Island 5 feels nothing how a final level should be in my experience. Ironically, Island 3 feels more how Island 5 should feel which is interesting. Imo, Island 3 should have been an ice island and Island 4 could have been a more city-esque island while Island 5 could have been what Island 3 is in the final product. Also, the final boss... wow. I hate to say it, but I think I much preferred Sonic Forces Final Boss which is the ONLY thing that I like more about Forces than in this game. It's not a bad idea, but there should have been a Phase 2 to the final boss. Having it be how it is in the final product just feels like such a let down, albeit, the ending of it is cool at least. Finally, the ending itself... it's nice, but it feels a bit rushed. More time could have been spent to it, but that may change in 2023 because...

There's going to be THREE free content updates this year and it seems there's going to be a TON of new features implemented into this game because of it, including and I quote ""New Playable Characters and Story"" which is kind of shocking to me. Considering how much of a disappointment ""Episode Shadow"" was with Sonic Forces, I will be lowering my expectations for this DLC as well. At best, we may actually see the return of a playable Tails, Knuckles, and maybe Amy with a skill tree that's tinier than Sonic's and a new island for them to explore to boot. At worst, we may see playable Shadow who plays practically the same as Sonic much like how Forces was (with maybe some altered animations) OR more costumes for Sonic. At mediocrity, we may see Challenges tailored around to Tails, Knuckles, & Amy while they were captured which I feel is the most likely option sadly. You'll probably play as them only for the challenges and then switch back to Sonic once those challenges are completed. Even if that is the case though, I'm still excited for the other stuff in the roadmaps and will be coming back to play once they are released.

I love this game. Believe it or not, this game has been something I've been looking forward to since 2003. For me, Heroes was the last Sonic game to have good gameplay & good story. All other mainline Sonic games have either had good gameplay, but bad story (Generations, Colors, Lost World), good story, but bad gameplay (Sonic Unleashed) or both failed (Shadow, '06, Forces). I've had to survive on spinoffs and fangames for so long, but today... I'm proud to say that in the mainline series, there is FINALLY a Sonic game that excels in both gameplay & story. Congratulations Frontiers! Here's to hoping that the future for Sonic will again be bright! :)

My final rating: 9.6 out of 10!",,
goo,,
"This game is jank as hell but still really fun (overall) and has amazing hype moments.

-Btw I am 16 hours in but have only just finished the first 3 islands (100% + all quests, incase of a true/secret ending)",,
"As a refreshing shakeup for a series that had been lost in the sauce for a good while, Sonic Frontiers does a good job of reigniting my love for this blue blur that I haven't felt in a long time. There's just something so intrinsically fun about running around these wide open worlds, while taking things at your own pace, however fast that may be. A lot of the supplementary mechanics that I was a little iffy on going into this game turned out to be some of the best parts. The combat, for one, starts feeling more and more fluid as you keep playing, and, with enough time, truly captures the feeling of being a deadly, speedy annoyance to any enemy. Building off of a really solid combat system, the Super Sonic segments (yes, segments!) are easily the best in the series, being absolutely awesome spectacles that don't just feel like a series of qte's. Platforming in these open zones feels really nice and interactive as well, letting you sprint off the beaten path to find your own way to the various collectibles. If I have one complaint about this game, it's the Cyberspace levels, which, while being a nice change of pace, do not control well with this new movement system. Music is still bangers all around though, especially the boss themes.

Overall, if you weren't a huge fan of the direction this series was going, maybe give this one a shot, as it's one of very few games to capture the speedy freedom that the Sonic Adventure games were known for.",,
Sonic fans needed this story. The best Sonic game to be released to date.,,
Best Sonic game since Unleashed.,,
"Gotta say, my time with Frontiers was the best I have had with a Sonic game in what feels like forever. If Sega continues growing what they built here they can make INCREDIBLE Sonic games for years to come! The OST is AMAZING and the boss battles are EPIC! Sure it has some hiccups but nothing game breaking, once I picked up the controller I could not put it down. This game definitely helped remind me how freaking cool Sonic is.",,

"As it stands right now, after beating the game on the ps4 and giving it a bit of time on steam, it's really hard to recommend this game at it's $60 price point.

The game starts off strong, giving a good first impression, but as you progress you'll start to notice a decline in quality and a general lack of ideas. The ""open zone"" design is neat for a bit but I found myself just trying to skip content through fishing with Big just because I got tired of doing the same thing over and over again.

The movement feels extremely stiff and weightless. You can be moving at 300mph and stop on a dime. Maybe for some people this is a plus, but it felt extremely unsatisfying for me. Sticking to the ground like glue also hampered a lot of potential enjoyment that could have been had with the open zone design.

Cyberspace was a mixed bag. Most of the 2d variants feel terrible because of how unsatisfyingly slow Sonic seems to move in 2d. What should have been the saving grace for these sections, the drop dash, barely even functions in 2d and I tend to just get stuck and come to a full stop. Reuse of past level designs as well as more green hill/chemical plant themes is honestly inexcusable at this point.

The battle system is.... there. I don't really need devil may cry lite combat in my speed based platformer, but I'm open to new ideas. It's generally functional (aside from parry being a joke) and flashy. Severely lacks depth, but I guess it's not supposed to be the focal point of the game anyway.

The bosses are neat and flashy, but don't really offer any depth. This isn't a huge issue on it's own, but it didn't feel like there was ever anything in this game that tested me. Once again, a lot of the mini bosses I tended to try to avoid because they often were a slog (although there was quite a handful of enjoyable ones too).

I'm not a fan of the new writing direction and the voice actors all sound like they had the energy sucked from them. I understand the tone of the game is supposed to be a bit more somber, but I still expect the characters to act like themselves.

I will say that there was some fun to be had, and the music is pretty good as usual... But after 5 years and so many promises, I expected far better. If it launched at $40 I feel like I would be more forgiving, but if you compare this game to other AAA titles that launch at $60, it's easy to see how it's lacking.

Maybe the DLC will change my feelings, but I doubt it.",,
"I grew up with Sonic Adventure DX and Sonic Adventure 2, and this game just isn't it. I'll be comparing this game with those games because others have drawn the comparison already, so I'll be giving my review in that context.
It feels a lot like someone who had only ever played Breath of the Wild was told about Sonic Adventure by someone and this was their interpretation.
It strikes the same sort of confusion into me as I'd expect to get if you gave Mario a gun and tossed him into Skyrim, but also added a handful of yellow ? blocks and pipes randomly throughout the landscape.

I will also add that I have only played this for an hour, as I have decided to refund it. My negative points here may be invalidated further into the game, but I found them egregious enough that I'm just not willing to give the game the chance, and want my money back before Valve decides I enjoyed it too much.

Having played Adventure and Adventure 2 again recently, comparing those to Frontiers:
- Frontiers soundtrack does not come close to the older games. It's very ""abstract"" - stages have a random cacophony that sounds like American pop-rock/emo-rock, while the overworld has a very BotW ""quiet random piano keys in the distant background"" vibe. If you like that, go for it - I find myself missing the hard rock of the older games. I guess Jun Senoue/Crush 40 weren't involved at all.
- While very pretty (unsurprisingly, graphics have come a long way since ~2000), the overworld feels very empty, and is reminiscient of a windswept and bleak Scottish island I visited several years ago. It's been peppered with a sort of playground of random little toys, enemies and minibosses, with nothing to offer any real cohesion or context. I don't feel very motivated to explore any of it after the first few minutes - I think this is a combination of a few factors.
- Levels feel very short. Again, may be an early-game thing. Sonic Adventure 2 in particular had relatively complex levels with a few different paths through them, the complexity of Frontiers levels makes me think ""mobile game"".

There are good things:
- Controls are very good. This was a major frustration of the older games where camera angles were often fixed; this has fully embraced the dual-stick control system and feels good on a modern controller.
- New take on abilities. In the older games, you had to find specific items in levels to unlock certain things. This lent itself to replayability (in a sense - my 9 year old self was a lot more patient than I am today), but could be frustrating, particularly when paired with the occasionally janky controls (remember trying to light dash over a line of rings and somersaulting off a cliff instead?). I find myself liking the unlockable ""tree"" abilities more.
- Graphics are decent, as mentioned above. The general design and theme doesn't sit well with me, but the implementation of it is good.

Overall the game feels like a confused mess trying to be Sonic Adventure game while also specifically targeting the Breath of the Wild audience. I compare with BotW a lot because I see the same ""abstract digital something plus old stone ruins"" stuff in both. Perhaps its a sign of my age that I find myself longing for a style from 20-25 years ago - this game is definitely a lot more modern, for better or worse. The soul of it is very different from what I'm used to and expect in a Sonic game.

If you've only ever played Sonic Adventure DX/2 and find yourself missing the wacky, comic-book sort of action storytelling, I'm quite confident you won't find it in this game.",,

"TL;DR its better than forces and lost world, but thats it. writing is overall pretty good but has a deus ex machina. thankfully it sets up character arcs for future installments. didn't save sonic but it didn't kill it either, get it on sale



its the best 3d sonic since generations, but thats not saying much considering the only games released between then and now were lost world and forces. the core gameplay loop is extremely fun but gets repetitive after a while, although i wouldn't say it overstayed its welcome. the overall experience is unfortunately muddied with unfun minigames and poor design choices (why tf cant i bulk upgrade my speed and ring count???) that drag it down a few notches. the first 3 bossfights were really good but the 'final' boss was lackluster, and the true final boss even more so. maybe its just because i maxxed out my damage stat expecting the final boss to be hard when it wasn't, but it just felt braindead. apart from the gameplay, the story was actually pretty good for modern sonic. not award winning but its an actually coherent plot which is a lot to ask for considering sonic's recent track record. only gripe was the kind of deus ex machina on the 4th island:

all in all its a good game, but riddled with flaws and poor choices that ruin it. 6/10, not worth full price, get it on sale.",,
"This game is absolutely STUNNING. It's a massive step up from Forces, probably the biggest step up you could've done. The writing is amazing, the game is fun, the minigames are fun, the Boss fights are EXTREMELY fun and engaging

Sure, the game has its jank here and there, but it's over all a really fun experience. As a Sonic fan from pretty much when I started gaming when I was young, this has to be my favourite sonic game by FAR.

Well done SEGA, you put out a really good game! would 100% recommend!

Edit: After the Final Horizons update, this game is just a must have. For a free update, that was just amazing. Playing as Tails, Knuckles and Amy after so long again was just so refreshing. Once again an amazing game, and now would still 100% recommend! Keep it up SEGA!",,

"As a jaded Sonic fan, this is easily the most fun I've had with a modern Sonic game since I can remember. If you can excuse a bit of jank here and there, this is a really nice experience that I'd recommend to anyone. An open world game with snappy reaction-based platforming, going around as a high-speed character, is a very good time. I'm surprised I haven't seen anyone else do that yet.

Also the bosses, oh my god. A Sonic game has never had so much hype crammed into a boss at once.",,
"somewhere between 3.5 and 4 stars. a solid 7.5/10 game. the open world innovation for sonic platforming was really fun and exciting, imo. absolutely sucked me in for three days. unfortunately, the cyberspace levels are largely ♥♥♥♥ and the voice acting is astonishingly bad, even for a sonic game. couple gripes here and there about systems but overall really enjoyed it. one of the most interesting 3.5/5's i've ever played. https://www.backloggd.com/u/roxaloxa/review/605720/",,

"Sonic boom your way through Frontiers

I've been a Sonic fan for most of my life so I've seen the series go through a lot of changes over the years. Sonic Frontiers is Sonic's first take on an open world style game and it delivers on all the speed, platforming and action you could hope for in a Sonic game.

While Frontiers takes a lot of influence from open world games it is referred to in this case as an 'open zone' game, which just sounded like marketing talk at first but considering how this game is separated into different islands it actually makes sense. Basically you will explore multiple open zone completing puzzles and fighting various enemies as you progress through the story which has some interesting lore regarding the history of the Chaos Emeralds. Some of these islands end with an epic boss fight against a titan.

Frontiers isn't all open zone however as you will also come across Cyberspace stages that play like stages from older 3D Sonic games. Well they're more than similar as I believe these are all recreations of older stages just with a new look applied to them. These levels are a nice change of pace and offer the extra challenge of completing the missions for each stage.

Overall Sonic Frontiers is a solid entry into the Sonic series and a nice new direction. I hope they build on this idea more and maybe make the puzzles more challenging next time.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is the most sincere, genuine, and exciting Sonic game in 11 years. While there's plenty of room for improvement, it manages to address issues the franchise has faced from Lost World onward, and shows newfound confidence and pride in the franchise.

Frontiers is a very different game in the series. Rather than a linear action-platformer with a grading system for each stage (still present in Cyberspace), the game is split up into 4 open areas that Sonic must explore, in search of his captured friends. Once freed, your goal as Sonic is to search these zones for all 7 Chaos Emeralds, so Sonic can power up, transform into Super Sonic, and stand a fighting chance against the game's powerful new villain.

Combat plays a large focus in this game. While some may bemoan the focus on battles instead of momentum-based gameplay for a more open Sonic game (which I would still like to see myself), quality of these battles is surprisingly high. Not only does Sonic have a plethora of attacks at his disposal by the time you've unlocked all his skills, but the game encourages you to use each attack wisely, from using Cycloops to blow the shields off an enemy, to parrying attacks and projectiles back at a boss to then immediately punish them with a flurry of devastating blows. The combo meter, while not as nuanced as a Devil May Cry game, still has some perks of its own, as it encourages a more aggressive playstyle without getting hit to activate Sonic's Phantom Rush mode, in which attacks become much faster and more powerful. Enemy tells could use some work, but this game builds the foundation for something I never thought I wanted or needed in a Sonic game. Better yet, these mechanics result in the best Super Sonic segments the franchise has seen thus far (complete with bangin' vocal tracks), which have bosses that test you on everything you've learned, and throw a few curveballs at the player for a spectacle-filled hypefest. Sometimes these segments made me forget I'm playing a real Sonic game, and not just imagining the coolest setpiece.

Frontiers also features a fishing mini-game. In exchange for fishing tokens, Big The Cat will lend you his rod, to catch all the different fish in a pond and fill out the encyclopedia. Rather than the intrusive and controversial character-change it was in the first Sonic Adventure, fishing is now just a relaxing side-activity that can net you some bonuses to help you in your adventure, and I enjoyed it a lot while it lasts. The fishing mechanics are sadly lacking when compared to fishing mini-games in other series like Animal Crossing and Zelda (or hell, even Sonic Adventure), but the variety of catches, rewards on offer, and the Eggman voice logs made it a worthwhile break from the usual action of the game.

The story deserves equal praise, as it has the best writing since The Black Knight. No more Classic pandering, no more meta-humour in a desperate attempt to seem self-aware and smarter than the writers actually are, no more self-deprecation whilst hypocritically delivering a sub-par product, no more placating to an audience that never liked Sonic *cough* Normalboots *cough* Hidden Block *cough* Game Grumps *cough*, and no more trying please fans in the most cynical, surface-level way imaginable. No, this time, Takashi Izuka, who was impressed with Ian Flynn's work on the Sonic IDW comics, decided to hire HIM to write the script for the game. People were hyping this guy up like crazy, and now, I understand why. He's evidentally a huge fan of the franchise, with a good grasp on its history, characters, original lore and kanon (and not the vague, nebulous and overly-Americanised ""Mobius"" lore), and the developers' original intentions with these characters. Hearing Dr Eggman acknowledge Sonic as coming from South Island might not mean anything to most people, but as a long-time fan of the franchise, who's had to watch this franchise lose its identity from Sonic 06 all the way up to Forces, it had me grinning from ear to ear. But that's not all.

Sonic The Hedgehog feels like Sonic The Hedgehog again. As in, the cool anime hero-inspired character who thrived in the 2000's, before being watered down into a caricature of his former self. Hell, all the returning characters feel like their old selves again, and even get some development and growth in this game. They acknowledge events from past games not as a cheap callback, but as a means of furthering their growth (or just a fun interaction between each other). Even the new character, Sage, has a great character arc she goes through, and Dr Eggman's voice logs are something any long-time Sonic fan will get a kick out of. We also get to learn about the origins of the Chaos Emeralds, and some interesting lore that ties back into past games in a meaningful way. See, this is what happens when you get fans of the franchise, who've already proven themselves elsewhere, to work on the series, instead of a hack Saturday-morning-cartoon writer who doesn't even care about the source material.

Now, none of this is to say the game is perfect. As great as it is, there are some issues that need addressing, and I can only hope this is the beginning of SEGA and Sonic Team's redemption where, instead of abandoning a good idea just because it didn't work out the first time round (or by association with a bad game), they learn from their mistakes and make an earnest effort to polish these ideas into something great.

First, there's the Cyberspace levels. Doesn't matter what context it's in, and while some of them have unique layouts with interesting mechanics, enough is enough. We've gone 11 years after Sonic Generation's release, and instead of moving on from what was only supposed to be a one-off anniversary idea, they continue to use nostalgia as a crutch. The controls are actually worse here than they are in the open zones, too, so that can result in some unwanted annoyance.

Another issue I had was the 2D segments, which were an unnecessary inclusion in Sonic Unleashed. They were supposed to be novel callbacks to the 2D Sonic games of old (even though the Rush games were still recent at the time). But in every 3D Sonic game after that, we've had these perspective-shifts constantly shoehorned, even in the games that featured Classic and Modern Sonic as the dedicated 2D and 3D segments respectively (resulting in only a third of these games actually being 3D at all). Sonic Team already nailed 3D game design, on numerous occasions. They don't need to fall back on this outdated cliche anymore. If they so desperately want to make a 2D Sonic game, I don't see why they haven't commissioned a fully-original follow-up to Sonic Mania yet. I came here for a 3D Sonic game, and I expect it to be fully 3D.

I wish 100% completion was more rewarding. Instead of a marathon of mediocre-to-okay Cyberspace levels, it'd be cool if there was a boss-rush mode or the option to play as Tails and the others, with their own quirks and abilities.

Lastly, I'm a bit disappointed we only got 4 zones. The adventure felt a bit too short, which I can cut some slack for being a more experimental game in the series, but I was having so much fun going through the game, looking forward to the last 2 zones, only to find out one of them is a short series of towers you have to scale, and the other has the final boss. I dunno if the 4th zone was unfinished and had to be repurposed, or if this was intentional.

Sonic Frontiers has plenty of room for improvement, but what's here is a good foundation to build upon. Judging the game by its own merits, it's a solid action-platformer with ambitious ideas, and pros that vastly outweigh the cons. It won't be a game for everyone, and that's fine. That's what Sonic's needed for years now. Rather than trying to please everyone, SEGA and Sonic Team have finally decided to focus on making a good Sonic game, operate within their limits, and take pride in their legacy again.",,

So why did I give this a positive review?
The story, the character development and growth, the use of past characters are very well implemented.
I like the way sonic feels in open zone and the minigames that are available.
The titan fights are amazing and feel epic!

"After Sonic Forces, I was not expecting much from this title when I saw trailers but after 100% beating the game, I can say is that the developers are heading in the right direction with modern sonic. I enjoyed everything about this game: the Revengence-style boss fights with badass music backing your flurry of attacks, the side story dialogs that actually have small pieces of story and character development, the guardian fights in each area each with distinct theme tracks, and especially the chill fishing minigame. One more mention of the music in this game because the OST is GOATED AF! If you're on the fence about buying this game, I would suggest taking a leap of faith like I did and buy this amazing addition to the franchise.",,

Very Great game I don't care what anybody says this is the best Sonic Gammmeee!",,
"Sonic Frontiers felt inspired by Sonic Adventure, Sonic Adventure was a very artistic and unique game because a lot of it's visuals took inspiration from the real world.

Something the game likes to do is throw nods to the fan base and Sonic community culture every once in a while. I won't spoil any of these classic lines but some flow more natural than others, besides the regular player wouldn't get most of them if you don't know at least a tiny bit about the whole Forces backlash and discussions online talking about how Sega can make better Sonic The Hedgehog games.

The detail of Sonic's animation is a very nice addition, it adds some extra depth that the player wouldn't notice during regular play. I appreciate the depth of the 4 different islands (technically 5 different islands due to Rhea island being the other half of Kronos Island without any content or puzzles or bosses) by depth I mean that this game is beautiful, graphically you really get some good fidelity.

Sonic feels great to control aside from being a little slippery sometimes in precise platforming.
We also get some new combat moves, you can chain these moves together and create a wave of attacks on an enemy. Only problem I find with this is that you can only attack one enemy at a time which can feel very repetitive over time for some players.

In short, Sonic Frontiers is a great game with a good spirit, and does most of what the fans on YouTube have been crying and pleading for (and rioting for) Sega to do.

4.4/5",,
"I haven't played a Sonic game since the mid 1990's but as a viewer on sidelines most of his games vary from meh to decent to bad. This Sonic game is different! Full of open world fun with great momentum and fast and fluid gameplay, along with cool designed kaiju bosses with metalcore boss music. This is the right direction Sonic team, keep it up! You have a new fan.",,
Very good,,
"It has a lot of issues, but ultimately this game is a banger. It feels like it's picking up where SA2 left off all those years ago (more recently for me who played it this year for the first time lol) and the world is super fun to go around. The cyberspace levels are a mixed bag, the boost levels play like ass but the SA2 and original levels are (mostly) really fun. The controls do suck for cyberspace (the boost is completely unnecessary for them) but they're great in the main world, as long as you adjust most of the sliders to be max. The writing is also fantastic, Sage is a top 5 Sonic character imo. The characterization of everyone is top notch, the references to older games are done well (would be a bit excessive for any other series but it works for here), and the new voice direction took a bit of getting used to but they all sound great, Amy and Knuckles being highlights just from the insane level of improvement from their previous direction. Also, shout-outs to this being the first game since SA2 to develop Eggman as a character. I will say, the finale was definitely rushed, and the second half of the game has more issues than the first half gameplay wise. The combat also sucks unless the enemy itself is fun to fight (a good amount of the minibosses are fun to fight even with the bad combat because of this). Regardless, still a great game. I would recommend getting it on sale but if you're like me and just really want it then full price is def worth it.

Also denuvo sucks and the settings menu crashed multiple times with me needing to fix it manually, big oof",,

"This sonic game is actually very fun and I can play it for hours without getting bored or frustrated. It's what the sonic franchise has needed for years now and I hope to see more innovative gameplay or open world stuff with this series. W game, good soundtrack for sure, and It's moddable!",,
"I had a good time. Janky fun.

Story: Better than anticipated. Lore-heavy. Might make you feel a bit (definitely wasn't expecting that)
- The Eggman memos are especially worth getting

Graphics: Decent, nothing to write home about by today's standards
- The pop-in objects were the only problem for me from a practical standpoint
- The camera angles can get heinously bad

Gameplay: Solid, especially for a Sonic game. The physics is my only gripe here.
- Overworld Map fun points: Big maps to enjoy Sonic's raw speed, racking up the combo counter for that phantom rush. The minibosses are varied and fun to tackle
- Cyberspace Level stages: Where any actual challenge is if you're obsessive about getting all the objectives
- Bosses: They're okay. Beating them isn't hard, but the scale of the fights were neat. Sonic's combat moveset applies here too

Music: True to the only consistency of almost every Sonic game, the soundtrack is amazing.
- Overworld: Somber. Big's fishing spot has a chill vibe to it
- Cyberspace: Ranges. Some tracks are cool, others are absolute FIRE (I got distracted hard by how much I enjoyed 1-5)
- Bosses: They cranked the epic factor to 11 on the music for these

If you're the type to get hung up on the technical stuff like comparing graphics to other AAA games, or how the physics don't hold a candle to how the classic games play, the game might rub you the wrong way. But if you went in with low standards and only wanted a sonic game that's just plain fun at it's core, you'll probably like this one.

Not a perfect game, but the groundwork for one is there. Here's hoping they take this formula and refine it.",,
"This game is worthy of GOTY. A game that's on par with Unleashed. This review is coming from someone who doesn't play this style of game, Sonic or not. If not GOTY, at least best soundtrack of the year.

My hours as of writing may be small, but I know and seen plenty of the game prior to release, and its all being confirmed as I go on with my play-through.

This review is spoiler-free.

General stuff about the game:

Story?
Captivating. Serious-toned, characters are faithful to their originally intended depictions, great for all audiences and especially teens and up. A love letter for the old-time fans, and a good and digestible introduction of what Sonic (& other characters in the series) is about (again, story-wise) for new fans. You'll find a lot of lore content too in gameplay elements, such as the fishing game, which is VERY neat. It creates incentive to explore other gameplay mechanics, and cohesion.

Graphics/Visuals?
Stunning. Picture worthy shots everywhere, makes you want to spend more time on each island, taking the environment in. If not for story/gameplay elements, then simply for the leisure of exploring beautiful scenery. A huge downside is the lack of photo-mode (as of writing) but hey, screenshotting works for now.

Audio/Sound?
BANGING. Enhances your experience tremendously. Amazing long tracks by many talented artists and groups. Especially the ones for cyberspace. As for sounds you'll find it good, but really the spotlights all on the music.

Price?
Absolutely worth it. If you focus only on the story, the game can be finished in ~20 hours, which is already SO MUCH longer than your average high-price Sonic game. If you want to 100% it though, ~30-40 hours. Especially for the casual players. Wonderful for the price, not too long not too short content-wise, *especially* for a Sonic game.

Now, what about the nitty-gritty?

Combat in the game is very fun, you'll be messing around creating your own strategies and fighting style. I LOVE the ability to practice your skills and improve muscle memory - again, this is from someone who doesn't play this style of game. VERY helpful for those unfamiliar and can use the practice in-between like myself. Not to mention how adjustable & customizable Sonic's controls are in the menu, this appeases so many sectors of this fanbase (and out, especially those that are not familiar with controlling sonic) to make the controls THEY'RE comfortable with. This is the most accessible and adjustable Sonic game to date.

Mechanics are fun to mess around with and improve upon, instructions are clear and you can follow along the game's completion without being lost. You can adjust your gameplay style, difficulty, and how much you want to involve yourself in side-quests and more casual play and not just the main story and combat. *You* get to customize and balance out how you want to play.

Bosses are satisfying to beat, cutscenes and their missions are immersive - quick - and fun, mini bosses are visually and mechanically great, and the minions are uniquely designed - combined with the combos you got are satisfying to beat as well.",,
"After Probably a decade of one Sonic game being worse than the last, this is certainly the biggest surprise to me as a Sonic fan.

This game is a loveletter to anyone who was into the 3D Sonic games since Sonic Adventure. This game tries for once to bring back a lore to the overall universe. It is not perfect for sure, as we still can't fully understand where this whole game takes place, as the Team arrives there via a Plane, yet other characters get there through ""cyber space portals"". So I as a player am very unaware if the whole thing happens in a virtual reallity within the cyberspace, or if the cyberspace has leaked out from somewhere.

The Cyberspace brings me to my next issue I had with the last few games in the series: Why can't sonic just be in the real world, without any weird new emeralds, some mystic rings or swords? I would love to see Sonic not try to invent himself new but instead go back to what he was loved for back in the Adventures times, like a big story that wraps dozens of levels up, despite them all being on so many spectacular (for the time) looking places. I suppose what it boils down to is simple worldbuilding to me.

But now let's go to the good parts of this game:

- The controls are for the most part fantastic and exactly how they should feel for an open world Sonic game.

- The big hub worlds look all quite good. Although only two of five places actually go for a radical difference in design.

- The Cyberspace Levels are renewed levels from a lot of different 2D and 3D Sonic games, covered up in a new visual design, to fit the lore within the game.

- Fishing has been the by far biggest surprise to me. There are certain things you may find in the area that will surprise and make you smile a lot, in case you are a fan of the older 3D games.

- Eggman especially has finally been given more character again, which we have last seen in what I think was Sonic 06.

- And then, there are the four or rather five boss fights. Each of them is a masterpiece. The controls work as they should, the spectacles are simply pleasing, and overall the fights just feel like having a massive amount of power in them. Needless to say, the songs of these bosses are all incredibly great and of high quallity.
The only downside I see on the fifth bossfight, is that it feels a bit off to not let it be a bombastic fight but instead a calm one fused with a mechanic that feels less engaging than all the other fights.

But yeah, overall I can say I have been feeling not one bit of regret after buying this game. Good Stuff",,
♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥,,
gay ass game,,
Good game. I like it.,,
Finally a good sonic game. Its been ages,,
"sega actually put out a good game for the first time in years,
good job sega
combat has its bugs tho its hard to fight multiple enemies when you can't focus the homing attacks
but still good game",,
Amazing Game & DLC helps improve the game to be even better than it already was.,,
This is best than Forces and I hadn't even play that one game! 10/10 I would recomnand to anyone to play this.,,
"Finally. Waited 10+ years for a decent Sonic game. Frontiers is not perfect but has cool ideas that if built upon, could lead to some more banger games in the future, granted, the bar is so astronomically low that anything is an improvement at this point. You can finally justify buying a Sonic game lads. WE EATIN GOOD",,
"Pros
-Sonic Adventure references
-great OST
-enjoyable movement
-interesting plot
-fishing minigame with Big
-Playstation button prompts for my PS4 controller
-open world collect-a-thon stuff keeps the dopamine hits rolling

Cons
-there's this super tinny noise that plays when you're scrolling the Options menu that really hurts my ears
-the pop-in is so ugly
-if you don't hold forwards sometimes you just come to a dead stop, feels very cheaply made
-some cutscenes are really grainy and bad, like a moving JPEG
-do I have tinnitus?
-NO CHAO GARDEN

I'll add that the combat in general is fine, but not particularly good. Some of the mini-bosses were frustrating, and some were quite fun.

Overall it's a fun game, especially for a fan of the series, but I'm more excited about what they'll do next. This feels like Sega's take on Pokemon Arceus. Trying a really fresh approach to their series so that they can refine the ideas that worked and fix what didn't in their next game.",,

I'm actually really enjoying it.

Keyboard controls are awful compared to a controller inside the levels due to being unable to dash precisely but that hasn't stopped me from doing any of the challenges in the levels thus far.",,
This game gets an elder koco/10,,
This is probably the BEST Sonic game,,
I will conceive my first born child to this soundtrack,,
The controls are too complex its a frustration more than anything else. The game feels a bit incoherent. I think they tried to do too many things at once and its now all over the place instead of just a smooth experience,,

This is Sonic Adventure 3, not only connects the story but also has an amazing gameplay
The open world exploration is the most satisfying part
The boss battles are awesome
The controls are super good
The hard rock music, hell yeah!!

Cons
Some popping
Menus are a bit annoying",,
"This game sets the stage for a new style of Sonic that has the potential to be the most fun and open in the series to date. Its fun to run around the open world, combat is surprisingly fun, and bosses are just as if not more enjoyable. The environment besides the forced 2d sections in the over-world and weird ways the physics work in game like how light speed dash will stop your movement unless their is a dash panel or ring to launch you. Cyberspace has great potential but is held back by short length, janky interactions with drop dash where you cant accelerate in certain stages, but increasing length and varying the stage themes can make these stages more fun to replay, cyberspace stages feature multiple paths which adds too repeatability and hope this sticks.
I didn't go into great depth with was is good or bad cause many others who review this game already do that, I just wanted to highlight things that I hope will be implemented and improved on in future games. Give the team who made this game a raise and more liberties on the projects cause Sonic team have made something that can push the francise back into the spotlight. Thank u for reading hope everyone has a good day.",,
"Hey, you know, the game runs stable, no major crashes or bugs, which is a lot for Sonic Team.

Visually it's quite bland. People have been comparing it to Breath of the Wild, but I think a much more apt comparison would be NieR Automata. Not only because both games feature the same washed out color palette, but also because Sonic Frontiers features 2D shoot-em-up sections which seems like a dead ringer for Nier Automata fans. Both games also feature primarily robot enemies. The soundtrack in the overworld also heavily resembles that game at times.

Even though the visuals seem to be taken straight from a different game, the moment to moment gameplay is quite good. It's probably like a 6/10 in all honesty.

I would give it a 7 if 2D segments didn't feel like Sonic was running through honey (cyberspace in general feels bad) and if the world wasn't so aesthetically vapid. It worked for NieR, not so much here.

You can tell they noticed this too, hence why the official poster for the game has a bloom effect on it.

I would recommend if you are someone who wanted to give sonic another chance after the last decade of flops.

I wouldn't recommend if it's your first game in the series.",,

Huge step up from Sonic Forces. While the game is nowhere near perfect to my eyes, I really did enjoy my time during my playthrough. I mainly prefered the open world aspect even if sometimes it would feel a bit empty, it gets compensated by the fun gameplay. I liked the boss battles, even if the game is not hard at all, they do have their own originality and creativity showing up. Cyberspace had much more potential, some levels were straight up not fun but the rest was fine, I still enjoyed it overall.

The game has its flaws, but I still found it to be fun and considering how long it's been since we actually got a decent 3D Sonic game, I think most of the people will agree that this is definitely a big W for Sega and us, fans.
I will recommend the game, however, I would advise more to buy it during sales, it took me nearly 27 hours to 100% the game on hard mode while also trying to obtain all the unecessary stuff and messing around the map. 60 bucks is overpriced to me.

Glad I got to finally see a return from our favorite blue hedgehog. And to those that are willing to start the game, have fun!",,
"An enjoyable game despite all the issues: pop-in EVERYWHERE, missing subtitles in the middle of the opening cutscene... the list goes on (and on and on), but others have explored these issues better elsewhere (see videogamedunkey & Skill Up youtube reviews).

A significant IP from a major publisher should not be so low quality. On the last island, I got bored and just fished for all the keys & friend tokens needed to complete the game. That's right, the fishing minigame lets you bypass most of the open-world collectathon content.

In my opinion, no one involved in this game deserves you paying full price for this mess.",,
"Fun and Creative in the begining, Painfully long, tedious, janky, frustrating, and hair ripping out boring by the second half to end

4/10

Was really hoping for something good, but it was just eh, mediocre. The 1-2nd islands are a 9/10 imo, actually tbh island 1 alone is the best, sad really. Game starts feeling so bloated with ♥♥♥♥ to do that it feels like a chore to beat the game.

I kinda want a refund tbh, I dont recommend buying this game at full price, or mb not even 75% price, wait for a massive sale, Games just not up to the 60$ standard imo, sad to see :(

Final verdict: Nah, not good, wait for sale, not very replayable",,
"Do not recommend until they fix the game.

After update 3 it’s been broken and does not work for most users. Game runs like a slideshow.

Fix your game.",,
Denuvo sucks. other than that the game is a 7/10,,
"so... this game is trying to do a lot of different things, and none of them quite work out I feel

the physics are a strange mix of boost and adventure formula which doesn't really fit either of them. it does give you adjustments for character acceleration/turning to tweak it to how you want, which does help the way-too-fast-acceleration, but turning behaves strangely no matter how you set it and often can't decide whether it wants you to not turn at all or if a slight nudge will throw you off a cliff. also, often there's actually too many moves which are potentially applicable to a situation and it's uncertain which one the game wants you to use and which one will cause you to overshoot/undershoot and die. the stages are mostly very short, and the only ones which are actually fun are metal harbor and sky rail. the overworlds are rather empty, and while running around is mostly fine, it gets rather annoying when the game decides to lock you into a 2D section you accidentally got too close to and it's difficult to leave and resume your course without completing it. also, the game will frequently lock your controls for a scripted bit without warning and at inconvenient times, and often not unlock them again until it becomes impossible to return to the previous area.

the music is unremarkable. in stages it's rather grating and annoying in a similar vein to Forces, except with less variety, in the overworlds it's actually quite nice and ambient, but still well below-par for a sonic game.

the stages are extremely repetitive, using the same few themes over and over with different layouts, most of them lifted from previous games.

collecting character hearts/fragments/whatever is obnoxiously grindy, especially on worlds 3 and 5, and it's usually both faster and more fun to just get them from the fishing minigame.

story is mediocre. it's better than anything the franchise has done since 2009, but that's really not saying a lot. it attempts to pander to adventure fans by referencing it a lot, but doesn't actually play anything like it or tie in in more than a superficial way. adds yet more lore which may or may not be compatible with any previous lore.

all things considered, it's a step up from the last 12 years in terms of writing, and an interesting experiment in terms of gameplay, but it kinda falls flat overall and just made me hungry to play some dreamcast-style sonic games again... which I doubt will ever be made",,
"When Sonic Frontiers was first revealed, I honestly thought it looked like ♥♥♥♥.

Looking in with no context; the rails being just there on the islands with seemingly no rhyme or reason wasn't pretty, the footage looked awful, the gameplay was from a toddler and last but not least the constant pop-in of assets. While I can't say things like the aforementioned pop-in are changed drastically from what we first saw, it sort of just clicks in a lot of aspects that weren't really demonstrated in pre-release footage. Sega dropped THE BALL on this one for a while there marketing-wise.

Anyway, rant aside I think there's a lot to love and hate about this game. The gameplay albeit isn't nearly as in depth as you'd hope, it almost feels like going in with that kind of expectation is just unrealistic but they managed to make something that's just fun and hype as ♥♥♥♥. Learning the new combos on the skill tree then mixing and matching those and chaining it all, mmmmm, something about it makes my brain tickle. That's about all I can say on combat- except THE BOSS FIGHTS. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I couldn't help but not smile for every single one of them. The music overall I'll go into later but the boss music is some of the best in the franchise imo, its the perfect mix of just edgy enough but not too edgy, you know what I mean? I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ love that ♥♥♥♥. I won't go into the fights much more because they are meant to be experienced fresh. Getting into the open-zone gameplay, I very much loved a lot of what they were doing here, aside from the glaring problem that is the third island's camera system. The game will constantly put you into the 2D perspective seeming almost random at first but its just a weird design choice that I do not like at all, not that all 2D is bad in this game just here on the third island its very strange. Finally, the cyberspace levels being this games version of the boost formula levels but most of them are short and sweet. Only a handful are truly challenging to get S rank, but those ones are HARD. Other than that, I don't have much to say about it other than its better than how Sonic Forces (last mainline Sonic game) felt by a mile.

THE MUSIC IS ALL ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ INSANE ASS ♥♥♥♥!!!!! I have no idea how they managed to make such a diverse soundtrack for this game and almost every song being an absolute banger. From the building atmosphere of the piano and strings in the island themes to what is closer to mostly EDM and/or dubstep in cyberspace levels, to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss themes being a lot of screaming but IT STILL ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ WORKS. Something I realized after writing this originally is that every island has multiple themes and changes once you have a new Chaos emerald, and I just have to say the way it builds up is natural and works BUT every track still has its own kick to it, giving you another reason to go back to them again and again. The fact you can use the newly-added jukebox to play all the different variants (and also music from the rest of the series) is also great so you can see how they build onto each other while just playing the game

I enjoy the story for what it is here, even though after the final update it still kind of lacks that punch at the end though I didn't really mind how the story concluded. The cutscenes are all really stylish and sometimes VERY anime-inspired (almost every time if it's JUST combat related) which kinda works for me with Sonic, like he's just some kinda rodent super saiyan and we just accept that?? Yes. The dialogue for when you find others on the island isn't bad but for the most part are just a few lines of banter between Sonic and his friends, nothing super substantial but definitely adds some character outside of the main story.

Overall, this game surpassed all my expectations and then a lot more. I truly enjoyed almost all of my time with this game and I will be coming back for more with the updates (Edit: D:) and the already steadily growing modding community. If you're looking for a game that's just plain fun and speedy, I can't recommend this game enough.",,
"A bit unpolished, but wonderful all the same. It was made by a small team so I can't complain that much about the former. If you can deal with a degree of jankiness, you'll probably have a blast.",,
"Really enjoyed it, boss battles were hype, the music amazing. The last one was kind of far too easy.

Most of the cyberspace levels flowed really well and the open world didnt feel that empty to me at all. All the mini boss's were pretty creative aside from the last island which just got annoying.

I'd easily give it an 7.8 - 8/10 well worth the £30 had a lot of fun exploring everything and the story was interesting enough to keep me hooked.

Also damn I feel bad for Eggman... that credits song was cruel.",,
"I dunno, like, this shouldn't work?

Someone saw Elden Ring and Breath of the Wild and said 'We can make Sonic like that, right?'

And there's no good reason for it to go as hard as it does.

It's strange, somber, a little haunting, and then I got to the first world boss and I may have literally exploded.

They did Sonic good this time! Like, unironically!",,
"This is the best sonic game in years, i was very worried about this game and it was the best i played in a long time. The Game play is fantastic, Cyberspace sucks unfortunately, The Plot was awesome even though there was a moment that i thought it was kinda dumb in the plot near the end.",,
"While I appreciate the time and dedication it takes to develop a game, This one has me annoyed. I've fallen to the sonic cycle (excited by game announcement -> let down by game -> vow to never get excited about sonic games -> excited by game announcement) many times, and I still fell to this one.

I haven't finished the story yet, but that seems ok so far, so I won't talk about that

Running around in an 'open world' is fun, but the fun doesn't last too long. You spend 10 hours doing the same platforming challenges over and over and over again. The open world's challenges (to open up the map) are extremely weak and easy to succeed.
The real sonic stages are really really really small and so very easy to complete all challenges (S rank for finishing quickly, most of the times I finished in the first go, with many mistakes, the red rings are right on your way its kinda hard to miss them, the ring requirement is very low, you can get hit a couple of times and still make it).
The skills you get look cool, but they kinda do the same thing in combat, so you don't really need to use them. By the way, I maximised the skill tree in less than 6 hours, at around 20% of the game's story, and I wasn't even trying.
Movement looks kinda janky and unpolished, though I guess that's signature sonic 3d game movement, so maybe I shouldn't complain about that.

In spite of it all, I will still finish the game. I did pay for it, after all.
I guess I vow never to be excited by sonic games in the future...",,

"This game is seriously good. I have played it for 10 hours away and am blown away by how varied, fun, and gorgeous the game is. The story is EXCITING if you are a sonic fan and SCREAMS Sega is just dying to rewrite the lore after Penders effed them over. There are also SO MANY REFERENCES to the golden age games and the adventure series, I would not be surprised if Adventure 3 or remakes are next!

Would recommend for both new and long time fans there is something here for you.",,

"Literally unplayable for me, even after all the updates. The game stutters so much on my pc. I have more than the recommended specs, but no matter which graphics settings I use, it still stutters. Support wasn't much help either. I was able to play the game just fine on my steam deck, so I have no idea what's going on. When the game works, it's somewhat fun. But the frustration of being unable to play the best way I possibly can, with no fix after all this time, on top of the numerous graphical issues pointed out by many just rubs me the wrong way.

This game is absolutely fantastic. Sonic Team outdid themselves with this entry.

The gameplay is fun! It's fun to run around the Open Zones and experience all the character interactions, mini stage-like obstacles, enemies and challenges that are spread across the landscapes. Without getting into spoilers, the major boss fights are a huge highlight of the game. Cyber Space is still enjoyable, they are normal Modern Sonic Boost stages, with extra incentives like grabbing all the Red Star Rings or getting an S Rank. The controls in Cyber Space are a little stiff and tough to work with at times, but definitely bearable and depending on your patience, the Cyber Space levels aren't necessarily required if they're not your thing, aside from the very first Cyber Space stage which acts as a tutorial, and as such is forced.

Another big highlight is the story. The story is like nothing we've seen since Sonic Unleashed in 2008, taking on a much more serious tone. The characters are all written very well, and all of their interactions are a joy to watch. All aspects of the story are things Sonic fans can truly appreciate and love, while still being friendly and enjoyable to newcomers. It's enough to make you not want it to end!

In my 22 hours of playtime I've only almost beaten the game, but I've played more than enough to formulate my thoughts for a review. The game isn't too short, but doesn't overstay its welcome either. For a first time playthrough, going for 100% completion as I did, I expect around 20 hours of playtime minimum. Maybe significantly longer for people who aren't used to or are new to 3D Sonic games.

This game is definitely worth a try, it's the best Sonic game in a significant amount of time and while the edges may be rough, it's still an amazing experience to go through. If you're a Sonic fan, this game is a must-have! If you're new to the Sonic franchise or haven't played much before and this title catches your interest, give it a try! It was even better than I thought it was going to be.

To Sonic Team, PLEASE do not abandon Ian Flynn as the writer, he's done an incredible job on the comics and has proven his worth as a writer for the mainline games. The story here is fantastic, and we want more! Please, keep him and let him tell us the Sonic stories we want that will make a lasting impact on the franchise, just as Frontiers has! We also beg of you, DON'T abandon the Open Zone formula! Expand on it, make it the next era for Sonic. The reception of this first attempt has been wildly successful, we love it! Please don't scrap this concept and move on to something else, or even worse go back to the Boost formula like we've had for the past almost decade and a half. There's so much potential in the Open Zone, and has now been proven to work, keep it going!",,
"After years of teething issues with 3D Sonic is back and hitting it out of the park with this new release. With many features fans were asking for and more, there's a lot packed into Frontiers.

"I enjoyed this game, it was a fast-paced and fun 3D Sonic title. Surprisingly, the open-world actually works really well, its fun flying all over the map completing little tracks. The classic levels are very short though and easy to get through. Overall, not a challenging game, but a fun one",,

YouTube™ Video: Sonic Frontiers - Mellow Review 
Views: 316
Another 800 word count limit review. I was pleasantly surprised how well this game turned out. Had a ton of fun and would highly recommend.",,
"A nice little pack for those who wanna run around. I did 100% the game in 19 hours though so I'd recommend waiting for a proper discount. Let's see if Sega can keep up their good work in the upcoming updates.

Oh and have fun leveling up your speed and ring capacity.",,
"Even as a lifelong Sonic fan, I had major reservations about the first ""open-world"" game of the franchise. I can say without a doubt, this is the best 3D Sonic game in a long time, possibly ever. It feels so much fun to zoom around the landscapes at full boost, and the puzzle/platform traversal to get around the islands is very enjoyable. One thing that a lot of recent 3D Sonic games get wrong is the sense of speed and how its always halted for the sake of obstacles that can't be seen when going full tilt. Sonic Frontiers lets you go as fast as you want and rarely breaks momentum, and it properly uses ALL of Sonic's moves from wall-jumps, bounces, drop-dashes, homing attacks, grinding, etc.

In addition to the open world islands, the Cyber Space levels are pure Sonic speed and fun. There isn't a ton of them, but Sega definitely went for quality over quantity. In fact, I'd say the vast majority of this game is a huge labor of love. This wasn't some product that they rushed out the door haphazardly. This really feels like a momentum shift for the Sonic franchise going forward. I really hope this isn't a one-hit wonder.

As for the negative bits, well there really isn't much. If you've seen any of the review footage, most publications have probably mentioned the excessive pop-ins to the environment. While this does happen quite often, it honestly isn't that distracting once you get into the groove of the game. Hopefully Sega will better optimize for the future, but there is nothing majorly broken. Another nitpick would be the puzzles that expand the map being a little too simple to solve. I was also disappointed that there isn't currently any post-game content which feels like a missed opportunity.

I was incredibly surprised to find that the OST has 150 tracks! Once again, Sonic games remain close to the top when it comes to video game music. Tomoya Ohtani absolutely killed it.

Don't listen to the memes that say ""Sonic Frontiers is a 7/10 game which means its a 10/10 for Sonic Fans"". This game legitimately is great and stands on its own.",,
"+Great OST with a combination of moody atmospheric tracks, energetic techno and bombastic battle themes.
+Open world areas are fun to traverse at high speed with the nicest looking environments in the Hedgehog Engine since Sonic Unleashed.
+A lot of great character moments and nods to previous games.

-Open world gameplay becomes incredibly repetitive
-Movement speed and momentum in Cyberspace levels is all over the place.
-Bosses are a great spectacle, but mechanically shallow.

Sonic Frontiers is yet another game that makes me wish Steam had a ""Mixed"" option for reviews. It's the most fun I've had with a 3D Sonic title in over a decade, but it's also bogged down with enough hurdles that keep it from its full potential.

The gameplay I'm largely mixed on. As far as general movement goes, Sonic is very easy to control compared to previous boost games due to the less linear level design, but this unfortunately comes at the cost of momentum being almost entirely removed. Because of this a lot of movement over certain terrain feels unnatural and a lot slower than it should be, and jumping off of certain platforms while boosting has you slowing down and unceremoniously dropping to the ground.

This problem unfortunately manifests in different ways in the Cyberspace stages which are a mixed bag in an of themselves. Unlike the open world maps, Cyberspace stages are more traditional course-clear levels that play like the ones seen in prior boost games. Those with keen eyes will notice that the level designs are lifted from older titles with a few standouts even from SA2. As neat as it is having these callback stages, these are unfortunately all they have to show. Not only that, the visual design in Cyberspace is relegated to four themes; Green Hill, Chemical Plant, Sky Sanctuary, and Empire City. I understand they likely didn't have the time or resources to model unique themes of every stage, but seeing those same themes over and over again, especially ones that we've already seen countless times before, really sours the experience. The last hangup I have is that movement in the Cyberspace levels is REALLY weird. Veterans of the boost games familiar with Unleashed and Generations in particular will likely feel put out with how lacking the max speed is and how finicky the boost is with maintaining what high speeds you can reach.

The side-scrolling sections are even worse. I don't know what they did to these ones, but they're slower and floatier than ever before, feeling like you're running directly against gale force winds. They're not as satisfying to clear and going for the S-Rank times makes you want to reach into the screen and push Sonic just to make him move faster. Despite all that, completing the challenges in each stage is a lot of fun and encourages replays to find the Red Star Rings among the branching paths. S-Ranks aren't too hard to get since reaching the goal under a certain time is the only criteria, with the only real exception being the now infamous 1-2. It's not a long level, but getting the S-Rank requires near-perfect movement, boost utilization and using ground pounds to reduce the time you spend in the air after jumps. It was the only one that took me more than 3 attempts and I honestly wish more stages came closer to demanding that level of stage optimization.

Gameplay can be improved with the four-way progression system. Attack and defense can be improved by collecting the red and blue seeds found around the map and bringing them to Koco Hermits. The other upgrades are Ring Capacity and Speed which can be improved by bringing stray Koco you find wandering around to the Elder Koco. Although unlike the seeds, for some they made it so upgrading the latter two could only be done one level at a time rather than Attack and Defense being raised in proportion to the amount of seeds you hand over. It would have benefited greatly from having the game tally up how many points you could upgrade with the amount of Koco you had and choosing how many points you wanted to put into each skill. Speed upgrades unfortunately also don't affect your performance in Cyberspace stages.

Along with the multitude of rails and platforming challenges in the world, Sonic is given more combat utilities to fight the various mobs and guardians spread across the map. It's not quite as extensive nor combo focused as something like the Werehog, but it's thankfully more varied than just homing attacking everything. Sonic can perform kick combos, stomps, a rapid-fire flurry of projectiles that deal small damage very quickly, and a few power attacks unlocked as you finish each island. He can also leave a streak of light behind him as he runs that can be used to interact with the environment, spawn rings, or stun enemies if connected in a circle. Enemies are varied enough that they keep encounters from being too samey, but I tended to start avoiding where I could once I had unlocked pretty much all the power-ups a couple of islands in. The mini-bosses are a lot more interesting, having a balance of being large in scale which make for an almost Shadow of the Colossus-lite type battle, and others like the Squid and Fortress that basically create platforms you have to fight them on as you chase them across the landscape. Take my advice, play the game on Hard. It's not overly difficult, but it makes the mini-bosses a lot more enjoyable and the true final boss can only be fought on the highest difficulty.

Bosses have certainly been one of the biggest talking points of this game, and that very much seemed to be the intention. Each island has you collecting all the Chaos Emeralds to become Super Sonic as it's the only way you can be powerful enough to take on the Titans. Mechanically they're incredibly simple, usually just boosting past their projectiles to homing attack their weak points or in some cases utilizing the incredibly generous parry to deflect attacks or stun them. What sells them is the presentation. Almost every fight in this game is framed like it could be a final boss, with the opening battle against Giganto in particular making it's mark with an intense sharing of blows and an over the top takedown animation backed with the incredible vocal theme. It wasn't a particularly complex fight, but it still had me audibly say ""That was f*cking awesome"" as the music died down. Undefeatable and Find Your Flame in particular were standout music tracks and among my favourites in the series. The true final boss was a bit of an oddity, and your mileage may vary depending on how much you enjoy shmups, particularly Ikaruga.

Big the Cat makes a surprise appearance in a Cyberspace fishing minigame. Once you get past the Sonic Adventure PTSD, these are harmless. It's a super laid back and relaxing break from the action, but unfortunately is also a little too basic for it's own good. Cast your line, wait a few seconds, reel in when the ring is in the reticle, done. Though this minigame is a great way to farm items for levelling up Sonic (especially in late game) and the Egg Memos are fun collectables with Eggman giving some amusing snide commentary of the events leading up the the game and a few details about Sage's creation.

Overall Sonic Frontiers feels like a proof of concept. Takashi Izuka said as much, wanting this game to be the foundation for where the series goes in the future. While I still very much liked it, it left me wanting to play previous games for a lot of my playthrough. Running around the beautifully rendered overworlds made me miss the globetrotting adventures of Sonic Unleashed, S-Ranking and Red Ring hunting in Cyberspace made me miss the controls and speedrun-adjacent thrill of beating my best times in Sonic Generations, and the more freeing movement and ancients backstory made me miss the Sonic Adventure games. It's a few steps in the right direction marred by a few steps back, but what's left to be seen is where they take it from here.",,

"TLDR
This is a sonic game with a lot of jank but is quite good being able to run around an open world without having the stamina of an obese chronic smoker and the variety of control options is quite good the combat is very simple and easy to learn the story is quite enjoyable cyberspace stages are not the best there is a nice enemy variety the bosses are AMAZING
big the cat BIG THE CAT IS REALLLLL!!!!!

The open world
The open zone game play is really fun to run around at the speed of sound in at top speed. there is a small enemy variety unique each island the only complaints I have about it are the 2D sections and the umbrella enemies on the second island that the camera locks on to even when you are just running past them.

The 2D sections of the open world are very annoying especially the 3rd island I would just be running to my destination the be dragged into a 2D section and the only way out most of the time is finish the section of jump over the boosters at the start

Cyberspace stages are in my opinion the weakest part of the game all the stages were from previous games with reused assets from generations or forces with only 3 visual designs (Green Hill, Chemical Plant, and a new city style area) and since all the stages were from previous games sonic does not control well in these stages with the new game play style. The 2D cyberspace stages do not control very well at all since there is no momentum to running or boosting the second you let go of the direction you are running you just stop instantly.

Combat in this game is very simple not much depth to the skill tree either it mostly comes down to mashing the attack button and occasionally holding down another button but some enemies require you to do the sonic new featured move The Cyloop. the cyloop is a nice addition besides using it on enemies you can also use it to collect rings and even get unlimited boost for a short amount of time.
The enemies here are nice since its not just boost to kill but some are still used as homing attack fodder to get to certain platforms but overall there's not much to say.
Minibosss can range from really fun to just straight up avoiding it every time its on screen
Bosses also known as Titans are extremely good in this game with each being very unique in it own way being way over the top with their presentation and designs with amazing vocal tracks to boot reminded me a little of Metal Gear Rising Revengance. The final boss of this game can only be fought on hard difficulty I highly enjoyed fighting it but some people wont since it is a very different style of game play compared to the rest of the game

Big the Cat is back and is ready to fish. The fishing in the purple portals is just relaxing with that lofi music and a nice break from the main game. with bigs fishing you can buy stuff for upgrading stats or if you dont like some of the minibosses or cyberspace stages you can buy the portal gears and vault keys from big with enough coins from fishing. The main highlight here are the Egg memos you can purchase from big each one containing Eggmans story and character development in this game.

The story of this game is very simple Sonic Tails and Amy were flying around in the tornado then suddenly get dragged into cyberspace sonic escapes finds himself on the star fall islands finds Amy and runs into Sage a few times while trying to uncover the secrets to the island and collecting the chaos emeralds fight the titan of that islands rinse and repeat for the rest of the islands except the 4th island which is a more of a transitional story island. There is a lot off callbacks to previous games that any sonic can can enjoy Knuckles is back to being is normal self with his rivalry with sonic and not just the cliche dumb strong character Tails also has his character redeemed from what happened in forces Amy got some nice development Eggman and the new character Sage also have really good character development.",,

"A beautiful, strong push for the franchise, Sonic Frontiers goes to show that above all Else, Sonic Team truly does care for the franchise and is trying their absolute best despite the odds. It may not be the best game this year has to offer, But it is a must play for anyone who's been wanting Sonic to push for new frontiers.",,
"Final score for Sonic Frontiers is a solid 7.5/10.

For full clarity, I'm the sort of guy that doesn't much like Boost Gameplay and wasn't super into Generations. Frontiers' main strength comes from its snappy and precise movement mechanics combining with some fun things like maintaining momentum jumping off a rail or flinging yourself uphill with a dash allowing you to interweave movement setpieces in the overworld, do them in unintended way, to just blaze through the intended paths. The overworld platforming felt fresh and fun, even if not as momentum based as I'd like - there's an actual degree of decision making and challenge that has been sorely missing from most boost entries in the franchise.

The combat (on Hard, the difficulty I played) while a far cry from complex often necessitated me to use the many attacks to pass a damage check when fighting the diverse roster of mini bosses, or my punishment would often be them going for another non-damage phase before my next opportunity to attack them. This was me being tested, and failure resulted in time loss, which felt appropriate for Sonic. Their varied designs and mechanics felt fresh and interesting, and only a couple are recycled across the whole game across the overworlds.

Super Sonic gameplay during the fights is not the best thing ever and I wish parries were timing based, but they felt like a kick-ass spectacle that nevertheless allowed for some expression and had interesting elements to them. The minigames, similarly, were mostly on the side of fun rather than annoying. Big the Cat's fishing specially felt designed for those that simply didn't like an aspect of the core loop of grinding for the next story segment, allowing you to skip to purchasing items faster.

The Cyberstages varied wildly in quality - the 3D Cyberstages, while sitll borrowing a lot of elements from Generations and other Boost titles (and at times, assets and whole layouts) felt fun and dynamic enough due to using Frontiers' movement, where boost is less an automatic play the game for me button and more a quick dash tool in your arsenal. The 2D stages were consistently bland and boring, but doing them was in no way really required.

The story was pretty good, although I wish the presentation was more enticing than simply characters talking all the time. All the same, the writing by Flynn clearly is interested in writing the wrongs of modern Sonic writing, and Sage is a good addition to the core cast. It also had some of the wack we've been sorely missing from more recent entries.

Overall, music was good. Overworld themes varied in quality, being a little too BOTW understated at times, but otherwise all tracks were excellent.

It's a fantastic foundation for Sonic to build off of, and hopefully it will actually be used as a foundation rather than thrown carelessly to the wind as Sonic Team sometimes tends to do. Still hoping for Adventure 3, though.

Final Score is 7.5/10",,
"Is it classic sonic? Heck no
Is it's momentum absolute jank? Definitely
Does it have the annoying open world padding of the same quest over and over? Yup
Does it have the dreaded Big the Cat? An unfortunate yes

Is it still fun regardless of it's issues? Yes

The puzzles are fun, the boss design is enjoyable to play, the open world forced grind is minimal (unless you are a completionist). This game is 100% a collectathon, there is no hiding it, basically think if Banjo Kazooie had Shadow of the Collosus style bosses of climb the big thing and hit its weak point, but with the speed of Sonic though with the jarring issue of him stopping on a... I would say dime, but no let's say grain of sand because it is instant the very second you let go of the movement control you stop dead in your tracks.

It is a fun game, but if you are expecting it to feel like a Sonic game you will be disappointed. I am someone who loved the original Genisis Sonics, and still managed to enjoy Sonic Adventure when it came out though never really cared for any of the newer 3D Sonics but this one falls somewhere above Sonic Adventure of ""enjoyed"" but below classics of ""loved"", it is fun so long as you are not looking for a return to form Sonic, though I would not mind if they add Big the Cat dies in this one and never returns to any future Sonic game ever again, I would take Amy over him and she is by far the 2nd most annoying character.",,
Fantastic game and a great restart for the 3D Sonic franchise since generations. It certainly is rough around the edges but there is a formula here that could be used in the future and expanded upon like Cyberspace with less messy physics,,
"A few things of note before getting started:
To gain the full experience, make sure you have the game difficulty set to Hard Mode, as there is an extra Final Battle behind that difficulty. You can play through the game at any difficulty and still face the secret boss as long as you change it to Hard in the settings before facing the boss of the final island.
You can also adjust how Sonic controls in the settings. I recommend turning all sliders up to max, but again it's all personal preference.
This game loves to use simulated glitching and screen-tearing with its VFX. I have no idea if that would be an issue with people with epilepsy or photo-sensitivity issues, but better safe than sorry.

The best way I can describe Sonic Frontiers is that it's an attempt to redefine the Sonic franchise. And while it's by no means perfect, I think it is still a really good first attempt at something fresh and new. Sonic has always been in a really weird spot as far as public perception goes, as while he's a well known character and franchise, it only really fully appeals to a specific niche of fans, and those fans want specific things out of a Sonic game. While reception among the general public may be hit-or-miss, Frontiers does a really good job at appealing to long-time fans of the series, specifically.

What I felt was the biggest breath of fresh air was the story and writing. For over a decade Sonic stories felt more akin to a Saturday morning cartoon, with rather flat characters and plot lines that were never really that interesting. Fortunately, Frontiers goes back to the kinds of stories seen in games like Sonic Unleashed and before. A story with a true sense of scale, adventure and high stakes without taking itself too seriously. A massive step up from Lost World and Forces. Characterisation and depth of the central cast is as good as it's ever been, but your mileage may vary in terms of some of the writing and flavour text. Frontiers's dialogue is absolutely full of callbacks to tons of previous games in the series. Something long-time fans will probably get a lot of enjoyment out of, but for newcomers and those not familiar with Sonic lore it can be confusing if you don't understand who or what all of these callbacks are referring to. Personally, while I found it to eventually be a bit excessive I'll let the overabundance of references slide this time, as this game seems to be trying to re-establish the central canon and lore of the series as a sort of soft-reboot.

The gameplay, as I said before, is a really good attempt a new direction for the Sonic series which has always been really experimental in it's gameplay (for better and definitely for worse). Traversing the open zone overworlds is incredibly fun and controlling Sonic at high speeds through the environments is a real rush with opportunities and potential for all kinds of crazy movement tech. The soundtrack all around is probably the best Sonic soundtrack in years, on the overworld, Cyber Space, and boss fights. Speaking of which, the boss fights in this game are absolutely phenomenal and easily the best part of the game for me. They're moments of pure spectacle, scale, and energy. They could all stand alone as actual final bosses in other games, and fighting them gave me a true rush of adrenaline and excitement that I haven't felt with Sonic for a very long time.

But even after all of that, it's still important to note that Frontiers is still nowhere near perfect. The weirdest part to me were that Cyber Space levels controlling so poorly. Cyber Space levels are short segmented levels similar to those of the recent ""Boost Era"" and yet for some reason Sonic feels incredibly sluggish and restricted in these stages, somehow feeling even worse than Forces did. The only other major flaw I've noticed is the ridiculous amounts of pop-in in the overworld. It doesn't happen too often, but there are instances where I spent several minutes trying to figure out how to get certain collectables, simply because the pathways to said collectables were just barely out of draw distance. And while I enjoyed the story and loved the boss fights, I could tell they were running out of steam by the end, with the final battles feeling rather underwhelming compared to the pure adrenaline rush of the bosses before it, making the ending resonate with me less than it probably should have.

All in all, Sonic Frontiers is not a perfect game, but it lays down a really good blueprint for the series that I hope SEGA and Sonic Team sticks to and refines in the future. If you ask me, if they took the control and movement of the open zone sections and applied it to longer, more straightforward levels with multiple routes like those in the Adventure games, then they could very much have a 10/10 game on their hands. As for me right now, Frontiers is a good 7.5-8/10 in my book. It has its flaws, but was still very much a worthwhile experience to me as a Sonic fan. It's really not for everyone, but if you like Sonic games (especially those of the 2000's era) you will most likely have a good time.",,
"Pros:
- Game play fun, like a mixture of adventure and boost
- Open (world) zones has a lot of depth, lots of random things to do like fishing and puzzles
- Lots of routes to travel through the different islands, a lot of new ones will open up when you complete puzzles
- End of island bosses are a treat
- Some decent character development throughout the game but could be expanded on
- Cyberspace levels are fun, the biggest problems with them is that most are short and repeated levels from previous games
- OST slaps, especially the end of island boss fights
- Decent amount of content, I finished in 14 hours but still have lots to go back to on the other islands.
- You can tell love when into making this game

Cons:
- Pop in, jarring issue that takes away from immersion
- Combat system, while having a lot of upgrades does not feel expansive enough, everyone will get the same upgrades eventually
- Grinding for stat upgrades is just unnecessary and takes a while to max out without fishing
- True final boss is not what I expected from a Sonic game... (very much missed potential here)
- ""Hard"" mode never felt ""hard"" apart from a few select moments
- Controlling sonic may be janky in some sections of the game (especially 3D cyberspace levels)

Conclusion:
Game is worth playing, definitely a step in the right direction for Sonic. I recommend going in blind to experience it yourself, but probably better off getting the game when it goes on sale.",,
"the camera is slightly clunky, but it doesn't stop sonic's movement from feeling absolutely incredible. the seemingly bland open world surprisingly compliments sonic's movement abilities and gives it a real feeling of freedom. the combat is also pretty damn good. story isn't outstanding but the characters feel like real friends and it gives me just enough to keep me invested.
good game, me likies",,
"I would give this game an 8/10. There's a lot going for it, however it suffers with some jank. If you're willing to overlook some minor issues, this is a very fun game through and through. If you're a Sonic fan, or are a new one, just know that Sonic's back in business!",,

"A good sonic game, bout time",,
You know it's a good sonic game when the only major issues with the game could be modded out. Banger OST too.,,
"This is one of the good ones, both a good sonic and a good iteration on games like breath of the wild.
Its a good sonic because its the first game in 15 years to take it's continuity and characters seriously, bringing back a lot of what makes this world and characters so fun to be around.
What makes it a good iteration on breath of the wild is the smaller islands the game is comprised of. The smaller nature of each island compared to Hyrule really helps keep your goal clear and there is a solid sense that you are ALWAYS progressing. There isn't a moment where things slow down or get too big to where you feel like you've lost sight of anything, yet there is more than enough to explore. It also makes leveling up your speed very rewarding as you can get to a point where traveling becomes a breeze with how fast you can go.
The boss fights are worth it alone. Sonic has gone full anime in this and its amazing to see him with this much style and power again put on such confident display. The mini boss fights are fun too and there is a ton of enemy variety with different ways you need to fight them and sonic's moveset makes it very fun and over the top to fight them all.
The cyber space stages do re-use level layouts from previous games, but it can be fun trying to guess which stage is which and the later stages are original designs. They are a fun distraction from the open world.
The story is fantastic, with massive lore implications and a ton of world building that we haven't seen in a sonic game in over a decade. EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER GETS DEVELOPMENT. EVERY SINGLE ONE. Even EGGMAN gets development, its nuts.
This is one of the best games in the series, period.",,
"Just played it through, roughly 20 hours for all achievements (all stats max, all side stories, all levels) and i can say, its good. Not breath of the wild good in terms of open world and play time, but for a sonic game going this very untypical direction, this is as good as it gets. If you are uncertain if you would like this game, wait for a sale. It deserves to be played after all the things 3d sonic went through and it opens up a lot of potential story wise for the next games.",,
This game blew my expectations away. I've never had this much fun with a sonic game and I've been a fan since the adventure era. This game had absolutely everything I was looking for.,,
"I would have no issue with calling this sonic adventure 3. The open zones are lovely and detailed, the combat is fun, the skill tree progression is appreciated. I do have some minor nit picks with the cyber space levels, but nothing that changes how much I enjoy this game.",,

Final Horizons Review:
This was probably one of the most janky, frustrating, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ difficult parts of a game I've ever played. But I love this so much despite it. It was fun running and fighting around the island as Amy, Tails, and Knuckles. The music is amazing. The final boss is exactly what I wish the original was (albeit with some really obtuse parts to it). The final fight and ending in itself made every other downside I had with Final Horizons worth it 100x over.

The amount of love poured into this game by the devs and its community with the IDW comics and amazing fans games made me fall in love with Sonic again after I beat Frontiers. I can't wait to see how Superstars is and what is going to bring in the future. As I said around a year ago now, HE BACK BAYBEEEEE >:]",,
"While the back half of the game isn't quite as stunning and show-stopping as the front half, and while there are some mechanical quirks that hold it back from being the series' peak... it's still hella good.

It's fun to simply MOVE AROUND in this game. That's impressive. The story is fascinating and heartfelt (even if its potential can be held back by the budget), the combat is fun, and the bosses are KILLER. Seriously I could recommend this game solely on the Titan fights, I love them so much.

Sonic Frontiers is a good game. God bless. Now I hope this foundation is built upon, and Sonic Team lets this Open-Zone format reach it's apex.",,
"I'm not a professional reviewer, I just say what I think.
And I think that this is a fantastic game. Sonic controls better than ever, the sense of speed is there (once you max it out, or grab the maximum amount of rings)
The cyberspace levels could've been a bit more better when it comes to steering.
Combat, while being just your standard mashing, felt pretty satisfying.

Overall I think this is a good direction to take. Maybe give Ian Flynn full control over the story for the next game and definitely build on top of this. Make the combat more engaging, make it something really more like what DMC offers.",,
best sonic,,
The soundtrack alone makes this a perfect game. Sonic's boss fights have never been better. Collecting things make number go UP and you get to go really fast. it's brilliant.,,

"2. Review after breezing through 50% of the Game.

It is exactly what they aimed for in any perspective you can put on this product. Beautiful, thought out, deep and extremely long.

And i mean the Open world with this, the Cyberspace Level are just the icing on the cake. Forget all other Sonic Games.",,
It's been such a long time that I enjoyed a Sonic game as much as i've been enjoying this. I didn't realize I spent 5 hours playing this until one of my friends pointed it out in a call. I highly recommend if you're a Sonic fan please play this!,,
"Skeptical at first to becoming my all time favorite of the 3D games since Sonic Adventure. It even tops Generations for me and that had my 90s nostalgia built in. Despite all the fair and unfair criticisms going around, this game is immersive and so much fun to play. It is rare for me to sit down and hours pass by because I am having so much fun. Can't speak highly enough about the open world, the mechanics and I love the Cyberspace stages as well.",,
"Beautiful, incredibly satisfying, and emotional. As a diehard sonic fan and apologist, this is the best Sonic game I've played in years. With tight controls and fun combos and great movement options, this game just feels great to play. The speed can be a bit weird sometimes, especially in the cyberspace sections, which imo, are the weakest part of the game but still fun. Overall, this is absolutely amazing. I don't often finish open world games but this is one I definitely will. I'll update this review after I'm done!",,
"Sonic Frontiers was a mixed bag when it was first shown off. The world looked empty, it had major pop in issues, etc. The game looked better as time went on leading towards release, and as more and more people got their hands on the game, people liked it. I finished the game the other day, it was actually quite fun. Sure there's some jank here and there, but it's certainly a MAJOR improvement from the last outing.


final verdict: go try it you nerds",,
The fact that they went from Forces to this doesn't feel real.,,
"good sonic game
me happy",,
"Its been a nice year full of good and free dlc sized updates:

Update 1 added basically an open world radio to listen to some of your favorite Sonic music and doubles as a new collectible hunt and cyberspace action stage and battle/boss rush time challenges.
------
Update 2 was a bigger in terms of overall game changes including the Spin Dash ability, physics and speed options to enable faster momentum based gameplay, open zone exploration score time challenges, new game plus, new challenging platforming challenges, and the free Sonic's Birthday cosmetic pack which not only includes costumes for Sonic and friends but the koco too and cosmetically changes all the platforms, walls, rails etc to be more vibrant and celebration festive.
------
Update 3 is the free expansion sized update that everyone was waiting for and essentially added an entire extra third of gameplay to the game. It does reuse the last island but its covered in new puzzles and challenges for the new unique playable characters with their own abilities and skills to unlock (Amy, Knuckles, and Tails) so its kind of a new island gameplay wise.

This new dlc includes a new ending although it assumes you played the original ending and is complete with cut scenes, some new lore answers, and a final boss who isn't a reskin and a mini game and the most surprising addition for me was the inclusion of new cyberspace action stages full of collectibles you need to actually find. I was a little worried that the action stages were just a side thing they felt they had to put in the base game but I'm glad to see they wanted to put in new cyberspace levels they didn't need to in a free expansion sized dlc.

The new dlc is objectively more difficult in almost every way which to a lot of people is what they asked for because the base game is easy. I personally enjoyed the challenge and its pretty much everything I asked for before but there is still an easy option if you need assistance with the platforming. At worst if more challenging isn't for you can grab mods to make it more accessible or just don't feel like you need to do it as a free update you can ignore as its own thing with a separate save file once you complete the main game.

Overall I already loved the game and I personally enjoy what update 3 brought and it definitely moved the game up a point for me and I haven't even gotten into modding which is make it even better.

-----------------------------------------------
2022 base game release:

I was pleasantly surprised, I wasn't expecting it to be bad but I was a bit skeptical of the mix of the open world and cyberspace levels but they managed to nail both and so far there is a good amount of enemy variety. I have no performance issues and have a steady 60 fps at 4k resolution on max settings.

The open world is satisfying to run around in like a playground completing the mini puzzles and platforming although it leans heavily into rails and bumpers but the world is a good size that its big enough to feel like you're actually racing through it but not too big that it feels pointless. And the cyberspace levels are more traditional stages that give that while bite sized (1-2 minutes long), they scratch that boost era itch for speed and collecting red rings.

The music could be better in a lot of cases but its not bad. The open world stuff is mostly just ambiance which is to be expected but the cyberspace levels aren't memorable so far. They're not bad and I get what they were going for and it fits the cyberspace feel I and but it seems like its just there and not part of the stage but the bosses is definitely where they ""spent the budget"" for music and is the best part.

Nitpicks:
Its also worth mentioning that there are some objects that pop in when you get closer. Its not all objects and I don't personally mind it, there are games with far worse pop in issues, but its worth mentioning if it does really bother you. Sonic's voice is also much deeper for whatever reason, its still the same voice actor for the rest of boost era and at first its like puberty hit him like a truck but it either gets better as it goes or you get used to it. Also while I can live with 60 fps gameplay, the 30fps cutscenes kind of suck. :\",,

"It was an amazing game, a must play for sonic fans",,
"Pre-ordered this, first hour in after I S rank the first level, I get the speed boost at 400 rings, get hyped and immediately boost off a cliff and eat ♥♥♥♥ because I couldn't handle my need for speed.

♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ perfect game I love it 10/10 would recommend.",,
"With even more time under my belt after beating this game i've come to the conclusion that this game just doesn't hit the spot for me. it doesn't scratch any itches that i've been having for sonic and i'm sure nobody would agree with me on that aspect. I've always dreamed of having an open world sonic game before but not like this in the slightest.
4/10 would not play again.",,
"Best sonic game since adventures series;

combat can be a little repetitive but fresh mobs in each act
soundtrack is mint
open world with minimal bugs
Amy doesn't sound like a screacher anymore
story is solid and easy to follow with foreshadowing

only downside on pc is the fps is capped at 60 and if you speed run you could beat the game in under 12hours easy, other than that the game visually very appealing",,
"at 3.5 hours:
Life long Sonic fan and this feels almost like what we collectively envisioned after playing Sonic Jam back in '97 on Saturn as the future of Sonic games in terms of how they feel and function. Like the torch was finally carried on.

It's also an interesting and addicting amalgamation of so many other previous Sonic ideas wrapped into a Breath of the Wild package...and it works!

The music in this is pretty somber in the open world, but awesome in every other part and high quality either way, though i will say that nearly none of it ""sounds like Sonic"" even when it's good.

You can tell Sonic Team really wanted to take this is a new direction and you can also tell they played a ton of BOTW while making it :P
That's really not a bad thing as traversing that sort of scale and vastness as Sonic is an absolute breeze and the new moves/combos/mobility/attacks are really what Sonic should have been equipped with years ago rather than a gun (Shadow) or by being turned into a Werehog :P

I'm rather impressed with Frontiers and it's truly been nearly 2 decades since i sat down with a Sonic game, *especially* a 3D title and got lost in it for hours before i checked the time again.

Great job Sonic Team <3

at 39.4 hours:
Honestly, i've loved this game.
I got mostly everything but still have more to find and levels to max.

Really looking forward to the free DLC, this game will have me coming back for sure.

Is it perfect? It's not, but it's the biggest surprise in AAA gaming for 2022 for me and that really says a lot.
Sonic Team took their time with this one and re-re-re-understood that *mobility* is Sonic's greatest attribute and what originally set him apart from Mario and so many other platformers of the early 90s.

The mobility was everything, having such careful control over the degrees of acceleration and so many degrees at that was basically unheard of at the time as most characters in game either walked or ran and that was it.

SF really does feel like 3D Sonic level design + traversal finally clicked and is an absolute joy to control and play with killer bosses/enemies, surprisingly varied and interesting combat, great music and a story with room to grow, let's get some new characters soon and write a 3rd review <3

Also, frankly, a Sonic Frontiers 2 would probably be incredible as this feels like..for lack of a better way to describe it...a NEW Sonic 1.

A few things:
-There was a small bug that kept crashing when you're in the Options menu but it was a Windows thing, you have to put your ""good"" video card as the default for this game specifically, then it works great.
-In the Game Settings you can turn off the restricted movement during dialog and this helps the game flow SO much better.
-The Game Manual at the title screen has a QR code that goes to a listen of languages...and English doesn't work :P the REAL manual is here:

-If you turn off the training during loading, it loads much faster.
-You can only get the true ending on Hard",,
quite fun,,
"6/10 on graphics, 8/10 gameplay, 10/10 on story, 12/10 on soundtrack. Was honestly a lot better than I expected, my second favorite game of 2022, and one of the best games I've ever played.",,
It's PEAK...😔😔😔,,
Just don't look at chaos island for too long...,,
"A good sonic game?

Yep. Kinda hard to fathom but this is it. The game is not perfect but the franchise is heading in the right direction and I can't wait to see what the next title's like.",,
"best sonic game in over a decade. don't get digital deluxe tho the outfit is mid and you absolutely don't need the items lol
hope sequel slays even harder",,
Long awaited comeback.,,
"I am leaving a rating in hopes that Sega does continue this formula. ♥♥♥♥ slapped, it was fun, I didn't like that the final boss was a completely unique and not sonic gameplay style, but overall it was fun

I would like Momentum to come into play more in the future, and I think the changes made to the homing attack and light dash were a bit butts, and I would enjoy being able to play as Super Sonic in the post game, but overall, solid 8/10 experience

Keep letting Ian write the story though, that was genuinely lovely",,
"This game is a testament to the fact that Sonic Team truly cares about this series, no it's not perfect but they clearly are putting the effort into making good games again. The Content updates especially prove this as Sonic Team has taken fan feedback and have implemented changes & features that have really made the game as a whole shine more. Can't wait to see what they do next.",,
"If you are an old sonic fan that's looking for some nostalgia, this is your game. The ui is nice and the game runs well. The soundtrack is nostalgic and there is a ton of easter eggs in the game. This game almost feels like its like Sonic 06 without the bugs of course. There are options to accommodate your experience in the game. The fighting is very immersive like something from the Naruto shipuddden games.",,
"A grate story, grate music, only ruined slightly by a push over of a final boss.",,
"I mean, if you're a sonic fan you probably already own or want to get this game. But it's genuinely a fun experience.",,
"Product refunded

i didnt like it",,
Pretty good game and long I am not a sonic person but I am having a blast with this I still think adventure 1 is my favourite game but this is 2nd for me my only complaint is that it can get a bit repetitive,,
"It's Good so fun, more Sonic games like this but Rouge as playable character please
Sonic cool wao~",,
this is one of the sonic games of all time,,
"Just played and gotten every achievement on this game. Easily my favorite 3D Sonic game to date. If anything, this shows that Sonic Team is still capable of making great games. It isn't perfect, and the formula still needs refining, but it was really fun through and through, and was absolutely a quality game throughout, especially if you're a Sonic fan.",,
"The first boss was worth the $60. After playing through and finishing, the bosses got even better. Soundtrack's amazing, voice acting and story is far above average for a Sonic game. As someone who enjoyed Assassin's Creed with it's open world maps and objects to collect, I really enjoyed this game since it took that and made it fast.",,
"Overall, enjoyed my time playing.

Sonic's handling was... fine. He was not frustrating to control whatsoever. I found use for all of his abilities, with exception of the drop dash, which found situational use only, however, even situationally, the drop dash would be on par with boosting anyway. Despite the drop dash using momentum, Sonic overall could've used more of it. Sonic feels a bit stuck to the ground at moments, causing unnecessary deaths. Additionally, Sonic's boosting speed should've been his base speed, and his boosting speed should've been the speed he can reach while at maximum rings, which is double his normal boost speed. Sonic controls fine, but can control better. Mind, I had all option sliders at maximum for turning speed, base speed, etc.

The combat, while simple, was fun to watch happen (as in, you press a button or a combination of buttons, causing a 'cutscene' to play, showcasing Sonic's attack on the enemy), although, once a certain ability is unlocked, enemies, especially bosses can easily be taken down very swiftly, aside from having to do mechanics that are enemy-specific, i.e., using certain abilities to take down a shield so Sonic can get back to his assault. The parrying in this game is exceedingly easy, rendering the dodging mechanic completely useless for 95% of enemies, as parrying requires no timing, but holding down two buttons until the attack hits Sonic, where he will parry automatically upon collision. The island final bosses, Titans, were a fun spectacle, aside from the last boss, which was very disappointing. The island mini-bosses, Guardians, were a complete blast and some of the most fun I had in this game!

The puzzles range from stupidly easy to ""Ohhh... I was supposed to do that, okay, this is easy then."" There really isn't any challenge whatsoever aside from maybe the timer on one or two 'puzzles'. Really, most of the challenges cannot even be considered puzzles.
The quests are fine. Your only enemy with the quests are the timers. Although, if one is skilled enough, it is entirely possible to beat all the timed quests on one's first try. It comes down to time management.
Similar to the puzzles, the challenges that precede island final bosses, are very easy. The only one that requires some modicum of skill would be the third island's challenge, requiring an overzealous 5 million points in a pinball minigame to proceed. However, that is welcome, even if it takes a little long, depending on the skill of the player.

Exploration, collecting upgrades, collecting items required for progression, is overall executed well. The incentive is there and it never leaves, leaving the player wanting to play longer.
Side content, such as fishing with Big the Cat, is a nice change of pace to the rest of the game. While not particularly engaging, it does not need to be.

Cyberspace is this game's largest downside by far. For fast vault keys (which are required to unlock the Chaos Emeralds), one must complete Cyberspace missions, which include finishing the stage, collecting all red rings, finishing the stage, and completing the stage with an S rank. If one is skilled enough, all of these objectives can easily be beaten in one run. Red rings are too easy to get, as in previous games, it was a set standard that red rings are to be looked for, or just more difficult to obtain. Ironically, I am glad red rings are easy, as it makes it so I don't have to return to Cyberspace again. Cyberspace is when Sonic controls the worst. He has a set running speed and a set boosting speed, regardless of your upgrades, making boosting absolutely necessary if you want to go fast, as his set running pace has a ton to be desired. Even if the assets and level design are recycled from previous installments, it is rendered entirely null by his lack of speed, making the levels a slog at least and boring at most.
Thankfully, it is possible to, though not as fast, get vault keys by other means, such as Guardians, or, most exploitable, fishing with Big. Fishing takes the longest but is most definitely the easiest way to obtain keys, portal gears (required to unlock Cyberspace levels), and other items.

No bugs were really had, with exception of a side story not appearing, making it impossible to collect two Steam achievements. While not a bug, pop-ins were rampant and nearly immersion breaking, at times.

The story felt okay and a little disconnected. The pacing felt very slow right up until the end, where things picked up tremendously, and admittedly, got a little stupid. The ending was entirely predictable, as well. I found myself unable to care for the supposed ""main antagonist."" The character's points were built up, but not delivered on unless the player obtained optional items from fishing with Big. However, character dialogue was brilliant. There were references to previous installments in ways that felt right, but sometimes felt like ""Hey, remember this!?""
Animation could've been better, music's good.",,
Sonic Frontiers is a really fun game. I'm excited to see where they take the franchise after this. The story in this game seems to imply that what ever game comes next will build off of it. I hope they continue with this open world formula. It works surprisingly well. This gets a solid recommendation from me.,,
"""I am speed"" - Sonic",,
"Sonic goes fast and there are a lot of stuff around the overworld to mess around with and platform to your heart's content, the game could be better visually.",,
"Holy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ HELL, please go play this game, it's so good.",,
"not perfect, but it's a decent start for something great in the future",,
y'all finally decided to stop making bad games,,
"This is the best that Sonic has been since the adventure days.

His movement has been refined to where we get the perfect mix of high speed boost steering and lower speed 3d movement and platforming.

The open zones are filled with routes, games and fights to where you can't move much of 5 seconds without running into something new much akin to a Tony Hawk game.

The combat, while not as involved as some titles, provides some great fun in trying to keep enemies stunlocked as you chain as many combos and finishers as you can all while looking very cinematic.

The main boss fights feature the BEST Super Sonic representation *ever* in the series, being absolutely epic fights with music and visuals akin to Metal Gear Rising Revengeance, even featuring a ""Rules of Nature"" giant sword catch QTE.

Top that all of with the most dramatic course correction in terms of writing and characterisation I've ever seen in any series, to the point where everyone finally feels like actual characters and shows actual emotions again for the fist time since Unleashed and the fact that this game ties together almost all modern titles into a coherent canon makes this the best Sonic Game in well over a decade, and a must play for ANY Sonic fan.


If you're not a fan of Sonic to begin with this new adventure DOES hold a lot of new things that might grab you, but also will not hold the same value to you as it would to longtime fans.

"This one had to be good.

After the long wait since the abysmal Sonic Forces, many were thinking it was over for Sonic Team. However, it seems that given enough time and a good direction, they can make a... perfectly serviceable game.

It's an easy recommend for me, yes, but it's also not amazing or anything. The Cyberspace levels (probably 30% of the game?) have similar mediocre gameplay and physics to Sonic Forces, for starters. In the Open World (Open Zone lol) the camera likes to force the player into a 2D segment sometimes at the drop of a hat. A button to 'cancel' 2D lock would be nice.

Overall, the open exploration feels wonderful, the story and writing is a breath of fresh air after Forces. Forces attempted to be serious, but went about it all wrong, making it come across as simply childish and unprofessional. Frontiers tries to tell a story that's more somber than other Sonic entries, and it works... after a little bit of getting used to.

The game is very clearly inspired by Zelda: Breath of the Wild's style, which is ulitimately fine, if more than a little overt at spots.

Overall, a 3D Sonic able to stand alongside Generations, making it the 2nd 'great' 3D Sonic title. If I had to slap a number on it, I'd say it's worth possibly an 8.5/10.",,
"Score: 7.5 / 10 A really phenomenal return to form from Sonic Team after years of misses. I really hope they can keep up the momentum and produce more work of this quality in the future. The UI definitely needs some fine tuning though, as most interactions with vendors, or even in the pause menu, can feel a little clunky and sluggish. Pause > Select which option you want > Select restart level > Hit yes to restart level. If you make a mistake on a traditional level in this game, it can be more worthwhile to die sometimes and auto respawn hopefully before you made the mistake then it is to restart the level, if the time score isn't a factor.

Overall fantastic game, and a major stepping stone for the Sonic Team in terms of quality. The movement, combat, puzzles, they all give Sonic a fresh new feel that I haven't really seen since playing older sonic games from my childhood. The boss fights are also some of the best in a long time, although the last boss' pacing was kind of subverted while playing on hard mode, giving me a separate section that would have normally been a Quick Time Event after the main boss fight itself. It came with some extra dialogue / lore, but overall, I feel like the main pacing kind of stumbled because of it, and it should've been something you did leading up to the final fight.

The levels are all varied, although some mini bosses do repeat themselves, bringing a new area to sprint through, and many, many collectibles to find. The game is very packed with lore about this world and the story itself, but not spoon feeding it to you, allowing you to find it at your own pace, or not at all.

My biggest complaint overall, is the UI can feel ridiculously slow in comparison to the game itself. If I finish a cyber level, get a bad time, or miss an objective. I have to wait several seconds before I even get the option to restart it, then go through the loading screen after that. Leveling up can also take ages. I was thinking about maxing out the levels for Sonic just to get the achievements, but leveling up his speed or ring capacity once takes almost 10 seconds each to complete, and doing that 196 more times to fully max out the levels did not seem appealing in the slightest. Which makes that whole process feel very sluggish for a game that you are so fast in. Especially in comparison to another vendor that takes the resources required, and just applies them to the levels in bulk, not requiring multiple interactions.",,
"Genuinely having a lot of fun with this! The character interactions are simply a delight, I hope they keep Ian Flynn as a writer as his passion for these characters shines through here. I found myself giggling happily at a good bit of the dialogue. As for the gameplay, a great step in an exciting direction. The movement and combat feel so engaging, I love mixing together combo moves while still maintaining that thrilling sense of speed, and running around the open levels is so much fun. The cyberspace levels could use some more refined controls, but I also enjoy those!

My main criticisms for this game have to do with the settings though. In Cyberspace, there was a lack of unique level visuals, it would have been nice if we got more levels with models and artwork that reflected what they called back to. Meanwhile, in the open zones, it felt as though the settings were not entirely sonic-like? Like... it would be so cool if the visual design could still feel more stylish and creative with the settings, instead of ""here's a mountainous field area"" or ""here's a desert area"". You can have those as settings, but I'd love if they could imbue them with something special to make them stand out more. The platforming elements like platforms, rails, springs, they could also be integrated more naturally by making them look more part of the environment (What if some of the rails were rusty, or made of different materials? What if you could grind off some branches?) The pop-in is also admittedly quite noticable so I hope there is a performance patch in the future that can help with optimization in areas such as this. Having a distorted glitchy effect when objects appear could be a way to reduce the jarring feeling of the pop-in while staying in line with the technological vibes. I will say, in terms of the setting, what they did get right is some of the technological structures and especially the enemy design. Goodness, the enemy design! They made them so fun to face off against, since there was a good variety of strategies for dealing with them, and they look so very cool as well from an artistic standpoint. I think they can continue to push the stronger elements here and make the environment look just as unique and well thought out as these enemies do.

This game is by no means perfect, as most games are not, but it is such a joy to play, and a sign of even more potential that feels just in reach. The foundation here is strong, and I hope to see it evolve!",,
"The only way to close the game without alt f4 is trying to edit the graphic settings in any way or shape


game is fun doe",,
"This is a really weird review to make for me.

I've 100%'d the game, it took me only 20 hours, but I still am very hesitant to recommend this game.

The games controls are janky and floaty, it's got horrible pop in issues, the voice acting of half the characters is not great, and it just feels like a confused game. Even leveling up your speed and ring capacity takes an absolutely abhorrent amount of time getting to max. Each level takes 5-10 seconds to do, and there's 99 of each to upgrade. That's 15-20 minutes alone of mashing X / A just to upgrade skills.

That being said, if you can get past those issues, there are many moments of enjoyable exploring and platforming, Sonic, Eggman and the new character have some great moments in the story and I felt like I wanted to see more of them. (Amy, Knuckles and Tails were okay too)

The music is pretty great throughout, with songs that I'll likely listen to outside of the playing the game, and the general ambience felt great.

The first few hours were fun, then hours 3-10 were miserable, I hated my time with it and was so frustrated by the controls and how awful parts of the game were, from hour 10-20 I enjoyed the game more and more as I played it. I'm not sure if that's because of the story, or if I got used to the games awkward janky controls, but I ended up finishing it and enjoying myself a good amount.

If you're a Sonic fan, there are a *load* of references to previous games, which is always nice to see, almost every other line in dialogue is a reference to a previous game, even less loved games like Sonic Forces.

Because of all the reasons together, if you're a big Sonic fan and have been disappointed by previous games like Forces, then this one is a step in the right direction and you'll likely come to enjoy it, but if you aren't a big Sonic fan, then I'd give this game a miss until it's on sale.

I'd mark this game as ""Mixed"" if that was an option, but sadly it isn't.

Even with the mixed review here, I will still buy any future story DLC as I came out of it looking positively on the game.",,
"Very good game, the most depth i have had in a sonic game for a while, even brought in some Sonic Adventure 1 vibes that i had been hoping for, for a long time. The option to change the camera setting allowed to play game for extended periods of time which prevented a degree of motion sickness i used to have with the older 3d games, i hope they keep this for future releases it was a good choice. Despite the other levels within the openworld being based off what looks a bit like the sonic generations zones, the openworld approach was a great move and makes up for all of it.

Edit: Taking it back about the levels within the openworlds playing it for a bit longer some of them do vary from green hill and chemical plant which is what i intially had issues with so no complaints from me.",,
"It's a pretty good game but there's some problems (btw spoilers)
1. I don't know what happen but after the last 2 day's that I was playing the game sometime's it crashes
2. on the 3rd day I decided to play again and it wouldn't even let me get onto the game when I was super sonic and defeating the titan
3. just a nitpick so this doesn't count but some of the animation's to the game are just weird
4. same thing from the titan boss when I run through the bushes before turning into super sonic they just disappear for some reason lol
but besides from that the game is actually really good loved the game love the story of it and yeah it's a good game I hope one of the developers see this problem and see if they could do a bug fix or something to help with save states and etc",,
"Just finished it and i 10000% recommend it, might be my favorite sonic or even favorite game overall, or maybe is the adrenaline talking...
i wasnt sure at first about the open world thing, bought it and played it for a few minutes 3 or 4 times without really getting into it, but when i gave it a little more time.... i played a whole 8h in one sit wich i never do, the open world can get you a little lost at times but not in a bad way, theres something fun to do everywhere, the portals are fun in a diferent way than normal, the 4 portal missions arent impossible as it thends to be in other games wich i apreciate, the mini bosses are pretty great, sonics moveset aint too hard to understand, and the titans... OH BOY THE TITANS, theyre pure adrenaline, these fights actually make you feel POWERFULL
To mention some things i didnt like, i dont really care about those minigames you have to play sometimes to progress, like the pinball or the shooter thingie, id rather skip those if i could lol, i also felt the final boss was a little too easy (or maybe i overpowered sonic too much) and that final fight comes with less anticipation than the others, it kind of just appears and you fight and its over in a minute
anyways YEAH GET IT IS THE BEST SONICS BEEN EVER, LET SEGA KNOW WHEN THEY DO IT RIGHT FOR ONCE",,

BEST SONIC GAME PEAK THE BOSSES ARE 10/10,,
"Haven't finished it - don't want to finish it. This game was way over-hyped. Obviously, it isn't a masterpiece, but I was expecting better. A step up from Forces, for sure, but a very wonky step up.

In one sentence, this game is: "" Walking on Stilts: The Video Game """,,
"Not perfect, but a HUGE step up in quality. Sonic team finally Figured out how to make a fun, somewhat decent game. I hope they take what they learned here and refine it into something grand.

That said, The game is very fun, but not perfect. There's significant pop-in, Cyberspace levels are a bit jank. I do enjoy that you can skip most of the Cyberspace stuff if you just grind Big's Big Fishing Adventure.

Gameplay is decently solid in the Open-zones, outside the pop-in jank. Story segments are decently written and the optional ones are neat rewards for exploring and collection.

I'd rate Visuals as not *Super* impressive, but pretty nice. I'm not playing a Sonic game for the Ultra Realistic 4k Graphics. Some cutscenes seems to have animation issues (Stiff expressions and movements) while others work fantastic (I really enjoyed the expressiveness of Sonic and Knuckles in their scenes)

Plot's alright. Never expected Eggman to get that kind of Character development. The backstory plot was a bit more interesting than the ""right now"" plot, but both work in service to eachother.

Overall, I enjoyed my time, but Definitely think it could use some improvement. 7/10",,

My four year old daughter who has autism and I take turns playing this game. Seeing her get excited with the different characters is fun to watch. It’s definitely the best 3D Sonic game to date and I recommend it if you’re a Sonic fan.,,
"After 11 years since in my opinion the last truly great Sonic Team game, this absolutely hits all marks, the story is so touching, the dialogue is so charming, so adorable.

Now about the gameplay, it is spectacular, I feel as it gives the same essence as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey, giving you objectives in the open world but with multiple ways to get a collectible, to a different location or with fighting bosses!

The Cyberspace levels could use some tweaking however. A few mechanics are changed from previous games and even this games own open world controls. You can't boost in the air and continue the boost on the ground like in Forces and in the Overworlds, you also can't boost or stomp more than one time in the air, it may sound insignificant, but it makes a big difference for experienced boost title veterans and make the controls feel clunky.

Probably the biggest control issue with the Cyberspace levels is the jump turning, if you've ever played Super Mario 64 you've probably experienced the situation when you just want to make a quick one 180 turn and end up making a big u-turn, yeah, Sonic's Jump has that in this game but there's no workaround for this one.

Those are my only complaints with the game and while frustrating, I did eventually get the hang of them and they don't devalue the game to substantially.

It's finally good to have Sonic Team back on their feet and Boost Sonic back to his former glory!",,
"Love the game. Story is pretty nice, and the character development is executed wonderfully. the characters are very expressive compared to previous games.
got tons of chills and even started tearing up a bit on my first playthrough.
i'm very happy that i got a chance to give this tittle a play~ <3",,
"A great sonic game. There's somethings that can be improved for Sonic Frontiers 2. I won't specify because there's a lot of people doing that. In overall I really enjoyed this game, as a Sonic fan, if you're one as well, highly recommend.",,
"Without a doubt the best game since generations. The open world gameplay is hands down some of the best the series has ever had but the cyberspace levels feel a little shallow compared to even some of the bonus stages in games like generations or unleashed but some of the later ones do start picking up the slack quite a bit. But since the open world is where you're at most of the time those aren't a huge concern. The story was also probably one of the most well rounded in the series being paced pretty well and even with some complaints about the ending being a bit of a fizzle I thought that it concluded nicely even if there was a bit of a quick wrap up. Overall I'd say it's just barely behind the best of modern and adventure era for me but if you want a fun game that has a lot to give this is definitely one to try out. 8.5/10

That was what I thought of the game prior to the story expansion update. The new update basically fixed any issues I had with the game before, platforming is way more complex and skill based, the final story has been way more fleshed out an interesting than it was previously, and they've managed to create a sort of blend of Unleashed/Generations and the first Adventure game but have taken mostly just the best parts of both gameplay loops and combined them really well. I still have to finish the end of the expansion so it might not maintain this level till the end but with a majority of it done I have to say this is what should have been here at launch to get a 10/10 for me in terms of a Sonic game. Especially if you do some modding to it to iron out a few of the issues here and there with a physics mod like Trackers Physics it might be some of the best content the series has had. Wait to go Sonic Team for absolutely blowing it away just for a free story expansion.",,
Baldy McNosehair is still peak fiction,,
Best Sonic game ever made,,
e,,
"This is the first time I think I make a review. All I have to say is this game is almost perfect there are small things here and there I have problems with for example, Cyberspace stages have ok level design but horrible control, The story has some weird passing and is very surface level stuff, and there is some jank in some boss fights. Despite that I think this is a very fun game and I think sega can bring back 3D sonic if they fixed the minor issues. 7.5/10",,
"EDIT: turns out this game is going to be given 3 massive updates fixing a lot of the flaws people had with the game. From what it looks like, if everything goes according to plan my score might change into a 8 or 9 out of 10 overall

One of my favorite games this year, it's pretty fun. My favorite part is the boss fights, which they treat like final bosses. Dialog is really well written and I like it a lot. I like exploring and going fast, I almost always play at 400 rings. Combat seems button mashy at first but is decently in depth once you have enough skills (especially once you are super sonic) Music is good too, plus Tails is in it and isn't awfully written ( I like tails)
Long time Sonic fans will probably like this game, lots of callbacks lore wise to things like Chaos or Dark gaia.

9/10 for the first 3 islands, 6/10 for the last 2 islands (they were unfinished)",,
"Haven't finished the game but going to recommend it to anyone who sees this please understand the following:

Yes, the game has pop-in, and yes they do need to work on that
Yes, the game does have some issues, but it doesnt take away from the pure fun you'll have.
Yes, this game is fun and you have to play it for yourself, sitting on a chair or in your bed watching youtube videos will not do justice to this game.

With that aside, the story is a little more serious here, its leagues better than Sonic Forces and a 1000x better than Sonic Colors. Once you play the game for your self it will start to make sense. This game is all about exploration and item hunting.

Sonic has a skill tree that you will have to unlock as well as stat levels for attack, defense, speed and ect. So when you start the game it will feel like sonic isnt running that fast. But later you will start to see his real speed once you level that up. Its a game, so treat it as such and its a brand new direction. I love the game and honestly will personally give the game a 8/10 and i can't wait for more content to arrive.

Sonic is back.",,
"Actually amazing. No jokes here. As a long time Sonic fan, almost brought tears to my eyes as it gives you nostalgia even though it's a new game. Sonic feels like he's finally home. Really. Keep this up, already looking forward to some sort of sequel (plz make one).",,
"zamn shawty the music is good to at some points god tier, the gameplay is fine minus the pop in which can sometimes be annoying, but for the most part this game is a solid 7.5 out of 10. If the pop in wasnt as jank and maybe the platforming somehow even more varied along with el sonic having a little more momentum especially while in the air it would be closer to a 8.5",,
"Sonic Frontiers es una obra que me ha hecho tener fe otra vez en la franquicia. Desde su mundo, enemigos, jefes, historia, desarrollo de personajes, y por último, su banda sonora. Mis canciones favoritas son ""One Way Dream"", ""Undefeatable"", ""Dear Father"", y ""I'm Here"". Consté que solo escogí las que más me gustaron, pero en general todas las canciones y bandas sonoras de este juego son increíbles, como era de esperarse de cualquier juego de Sonic. ¡Y ese final, wow!

"good control of sonic, decent graphics, decent stages, lame story",,
The game is fun. I enjoyed it. This is the first sonic game that i ever tried. I'm definitely getting better at the game.,,
Steam reviewers tell the difference between them not liking the game and the game actually being a solid game challenge (impossible),,
I really like this game. titan fights are pretty awesome,,
Fye,,
this feels nothing like a sonic game 10/10,,
"The fetching of tokens is by far the worst part of the game. The last island was the worst, spent over 2 hrs collecting tokens. This game is basically a glorified fetch quest and doesn't really offer much, Sonic adventure 1 & 2 are much better than this pile of turd.",,
"Так как я являюсь фанатом данной ленейки игр про Соника могу сказать что на эту игру у меня были сильно завышенные ожидания. Моя самая любимая часть это Sonic Unleashed потому что там прям идеально подоганы движения персонажа (имею ввиду дневной режим) под окружающую среду и взаимодецствие с обьектами. Здесь же как то выглядит все топорно, я все еще надеюсь что когда нибудь ту самую старую игру портируют на пк и я бы только в нее и играл.
а так в целом игра хорошая мне поравилось !",,
"Even with mods, the game is still a glitchy experience plagued with janky movement/collision and really constraining PC options (even with this one being about cyber space). If there's any series that should embrace high framerate/refresh rate as part of the intended experience, it's Sonic. But no, 60 fps cap and no ultrawide support either, and it would keep resetting resolution. Very basic settings in general. No voice audio unless you enable Windows Sonic for Headphones. I figure there isn't any patching effort going on at this late date post-release either if it's still in this state.

I wanted to go with this version over consoles because the Switch seemingly made every console version have constant super bad LOD pop-in everywhere, but even with max LOD modding on PC here you still see it sometimes. It's weird playing a Sonic game that is so much about puzzles, and it's very blatantly derivative of Breath of the Wild, but there are some ideas with potential here and Sonic hasn't really tried expanding its scope in a long, long time, so I respect that this one was trying something different, but it just feels like a less tedious Sonic '06 with some good music that puts you in a reflective mood. Unfortunately, my reflections have led me to the conclusion that I'm just not gonna click with this game and I should get my $28 back. Hoping that the inevitable Frontiers 2 is a more proper PC release and sorts out the jank.",,

"This is my first ever sonic game, and it is very friendly to beginners. If you are trying to go for 100% completion it gets tedious in the end but I still had a fun time. Great soundtrack, fun minibosses and bosses. Definitely recommend.",,
"Really amazing game. I've been going through a bunch of games in my backlog lately that I didn't really care much about, so it was great to play a game that I was excited to keep going with. The end of the base game kinda fumbles a bit, and then the DLC is kinda just unsatisfyingly difficult at times, so it only gets like a 7/10 for me, but overall that's a pretty good score to me, so totally check it out.",,
"I was real critical of this game coming to it's launch. I even refused to buy it for full price, waiting until it went on sale to grab it. However, I think this game turned out to be worth the full price.

If there's one thing this game is not, it's lacking content. I was honestly surprised how many times this game seemed to surprise me. I expected the open world gimmick to get relatively stale within a handful of hours, and I expected to clear all the islands relatively quickly. But instead, although there was a lot of similar moments, there was also a major surprisingly amount of new twist and moments they throw at you. The types of obstacles they use, the types of environments you get thrown into, they don't repeat nearly as much as I thought, and I could tell they had some people really doing what they could to keep things fresh all the way through. Every time I think I've seen all an island has to offer, I find out there's an entire segment of the island, sometimes underground, sometimes in the sky, sometimes just behind a certain corner that I never looked for, there would be an entire new theme of challenges and environments I hadn't seen before. This kept me consistently engaged, wanting to see the next interesting thing they had to throw at me. Although there was a ton of those little platform challenges across the open world, no two of them were the same, and most of them made good use of the environment they were in. I think it kept surprising me enough that this game definitely deserves the full price. There's a ton of content in this game if you're willing to take your time and look for it.
And of course, the gameplay itself is very fun. Running is fast and satisfying, the cyberspace levels (although not as fast and engaging as Generations or Unleashed,) are still very fun and interesting to go through, with many making me want to replay numerous times to beat my record time, which any good sonic game should do.
If you buy it for full price, you'll get your money's worth, believe me. It doesn't do as good as it may had potential to do, but it does plenty right to warrant a look into.",,
"Sonic Frontiers, touted as a bold step for the iconic franchise, left much to be desired. The ambitious open world concept, while promising, crumbled under the weight of technical shortcomings from pervasive glitches to frustrating frame rate drops. The narrative felt disjointed, failing to engage players in a compelling storyline. Even more disappointing was the gameplay, which struggled to recapture the magic of classic Sonic experiences. It's disheartening to witness such unfulfilled potential, as Sonic Frontiers misses the mark on what could have been a revitalizing chapter for this beloved gaming series. But if you want to play it dont let this change your mind its a 7.5/10",,
"while this game is far from perfect and has flaws that definitely need to be ironed out by the next mainline sonic entry, i can easily and wholeheartedly say this is the most fun i've had with a sonic game since sonic generations all those years ago. the gameplay loop is mostly engaging and fun, the cyber space stages provide a nice contrast to the exploration you do in the open-zone segments, and just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around with the giant sandboxes that you're given along the platforms and railgrinds you can hop on, it makes for a surprisingly fun experience. the story is decent too for once, and honestly if you can get past some of the slight control jank in certain cyber space stages it's a genuinely good game, especially now with all the free DLC having been added into the game. highly recommend this game, and i'm very excited for the future of these games if this'll be the blueprint they'll expand on for the next few sonic games.",,
"I found the game kind of cool (?) but.. it was not really worth the price (i bought it fot 60 or 70 Euros back when it came out). Outside of the occasional and interesting stages/levels, the entire game seemed oddly colorless and empty. The vibes were nice and the music (THE MUSICCCC), all in all Sonic is more of a teen in this game. But, sadly, the amount of bugs and stuff I've encountered just left a bitter taste in my mouth and i could barely enjoy it. Sonic always randomly got out of contol and stuff.. not nice, epecially not in a boss fight. It stutters, lags, and breaks midway. I lost interest pretty quickly (despite my love for the blue blur).

If you have a laptop/pc that is ""okay"" (and not a really expensive set up) and you think ""hmm maybe it'll work, right? My laptop/pc isn't that bad!"", the game will absolutely lag and even crash. Solid 5/10 until now, I'll try it again once I have a better setup and hopefully I'll be able to enjoy it then.",,
great game to jus play and relax to as well as jus having fun wit it if you're a sonic fan you'll like the game at least a little bit for what it is. 9/10 would recommend,,
"Great game with music and challenges. The island are interesting, a little dull but it becomes you're playground. Character story is hidden and deep. And the combination of 3D and 2D platforming is great.",,
fun sonic game with a modern twist wicked,,
Unlock the spindash and the game gets 100x better,,
sonic fan dream come true,,
good game,,
"Finally a ""open-world"" sonic game with great visuals. Sometimes it feels weird to see sonic in world like that but its okey. The only thing I dont like is that everything looks the same and after like 3 hours you will be dissapointed. But the first few hours of the gameplay are cool",,

"This game is pretty solid, mature story, good gameplay, but the issues with the new ""final horizon"" are more fault of the fans than sega, since the fans complained before that the parry was ""too easy"", now to get the new ending is almost imposible and now they comlpain about it being too hard (wich is true but it is their fault that the parry is now annoying as hell)",,
"Not the worst game, ever. Buggy as hell, but I don't think it really detracts from the game play too much. The fights and combat are good, they get a bit repetitive but not too much. Story is ok. However, this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid soundtrack made me, and I'm assuming it a lot of other people, completely forget about this game's mediocrity. I stg 90% of this game's budget must have gone to this OST. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ they did not need to go that hard for a game about a blue rodent.

Also there's a fishing so overall the game is a 10/10.",,
This game really makes it feel like I did when I was a kid playing sonic adventure 1&2 on gc. Even more so since you can scroll through tracks which is a really nice feature. Love the music and the gameplay rocks. Nice work Sonic Team! Happy birthday Sonic!!!!!!!!,,
"do not read if you don't want any spoilers.

Update 3 legit improves a lot, because before update 3 all i did in the final island was fishing the items, and then beat a purple moon, where on easy or normal you basically only had to do 3 really easy quick time events, or on hard the most boring boss in the game, because you basically have i frames with the white and red orbs, plus can destroy any challenge with ""the end"" boss, thanks to the super sonic meter weapon.

Update 3 now allows you do do way more stuff than just fishing, because you can basically play Amy the most balanced character, knuckles where it can bypass platforming sections, and tails is basically spectator mode because you can fly around anywhere, and sonic basically have these cool challenging towers, that put your platforming skills to the test.

While the trials i understand what they were going for, but i think its badly done, because the 1st or 4th trial, you have to think outside the box to beat them, while the second or third trial you have to time parry, and of course the most hated one trial 5.

I do agree trial 5 is bad, but its not the worst thing in the game, there is a few positives i can give trial 5, because Giganto and Knight in trial 5, you basically don't need to parry to beat them, even on hard you don't have to parry, because your allowed to dodge there attacks, or use the sonic boom projectile to basically not parry Knight shield.

Sadly Wyvern is what ruins trial 5, because your forced to parry it to damage it, the problem with Wyvern is the attack hitbox are delayed or way to early, and the worst part is the audio cues for parry with Wyvern is gone in second phase, basically i was able to beat Wyvern with hard, by basically spam pressing q and e, by me spam pressing it as quickly as possible by pure dumb luck, and another issue is Wyvern to activate the fight take the longest, which is the problem of copying and pasting stuff, thankfully easy mode fixes all the issues i have with Wyvern, because the parry is 2 to 3 seconds long on easy in trial 5, but still even on easy i think trial 5 is bad, because on easy its boring cuz your fighting the same bosses again but worse, but on normal and hard or extreme good luck beating Wyvern because I'm convinced its not play tested on extreme or hard mode.

And for the final boss for update 3 its way better than ""the end,"" but it still has issues, because its designed to be poorly explained what your suppose to do to destroy the healing tube, don't get me wrong once you know how to destroy the healing tube, the new supreme phase is fun to fight against, and the timed parry system works well against the final boss in update 3 because its designed for it, but if you have to shove in the king koko advice system, as an excuse to tell the player you have to play cyberspace levels to know how to beat the final boss, then that's just an outdated game design to make update 3 way longer to play through, because people will watch a YouTube video how to beat the final boss.

And speaking of cyberspace levels, update 3 has the best cyberspace levels in the game, why you ask because they finally do something with it, and not copy and paste sonic generations or sonic unleashed level design, where it lasts 1 minute most of the time.

And also update 3 brings the 3 enemies from beta are now in the game, and i can say 2 of them which is tank+ or Caterpillar+ are way better than the original release version, i had to think how to beat them, the only one i understand why they ditched from beta, is spider+ because spider+ is boring, you basically just spam cyloop hoping the projectiles hit, and then attack it once spider+ is down, then you run from the auto aiming spikes, and then parry the ground spike, that's legit it 3 attacks,

plus the narrative fixes, i absolutely hated when they ditched the cyber corruption, thankfully update 3 keeps the cyber corruption, i legit have no clue how Eggman can somehow revive sage over typing because if Eggman can revive Sage that easily why was he worried about her, now i don't have to see that Cut scene anymore. i can go on but you get the point.

Overall the only major issues i have with sonic frontiers now, is the pop in or the pinball mini game, and that's about it because the other issues i have with sonic frontiers is now optional, 9/10 sonic game for me due to how much it repaired the game series, and a 8/10 game compared to other games based on my experience, this game used to be a 6/10 for me but these updates improved the game a lot.",,
"I paid half of the full price and got half of the game I wanted out of these 30 long years.

Finally a good 3D Sonic game. YES! wait whats with all these design choices?
The game is in this weird spot between ""Play on all the things"" and ""ignore everything and go fishing"" in order to progress. The fighting is here. it's weird.
It's really the Skyrim of Sonic games. Mods make it 10 times more fun and balanced (tryhardy).

I'm not uploading ♥♥♥♥ about that DLC tho. I got my ass whipped. That was the most maliciously compliant expansion I ever scrapped through in my life.",,
"Como fan de sonic, me duele decir que: aia",,
Hype,,
Sonic meets the frontiers,,
"Frontier is a very great game. I just haven't finished yet, but I would recommend this to anybody who's a big Sonic fan.",,
"Juego decente, un buen paso en la dirección correcta

El ultimo DLC es bastante desafiante y es difícil recomendarlo si ya te frustra el plataformeo del juego base, pero vale la pena intentarlo",,
"Did you guys know a Sonic game can actually be good?

It's not perfect, with some janky spots and weird difficulty spikes out of nowhere, (the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ TOWERS,) but I actually had fun almost the entire time. The gameplay is good, and the characters are actually written well for once! The new free update is just icing on the cake.

Kinda weird that Amy has a better glide than Knuckles, though.",,
"This is pretty much what I expected, but definitely not what I want from a Sonic open-world game. Many platformers come to mind when thinking about fun and satisfying movement schemes: Super Mario Odyssey, A Hat in Time, Spark 3, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk... These are all games with immaculate controls that manage to introduce the player to a world of pure joy just by tilting the joystick forward. This feeling is, sadly, nowhere to be found in Sonic Frontiers.

Sonic's movement is in a weird spot here because while there are some pretty cool things you can pull off in both the open zone and the cyberspace levels, it still feels clunky and unnatural. Level design is very mediocre, barely above Forces, and only made worse by the insane pop-in present all throughout the game. Blocks and rails in the sky placed without any rhyme or reason on a default Unreal Engine map are also big factors that detract from the experience. There's also combat, but it's so barebones I don't even think it's worth discussing. One thing I'm willing to commend this game for, though, is its portrayal of Super Sonic, easily the coolest scenes I've seen in a long time.

Ah, and then there's Update 3, where they decided the game was too easy, so they made a challenge that requires you to do a frame-perfect parry on bosses that were never designed for such a thing. On the other hand, you can play as Tails, who has Super Sonic tier flying and can skip any and all challenges (which is admittedly a very on-brand thing for Tails' gameplay). Obviously, nobody playtested any of this; it's honestly pretty funny. I mean, even the new final boss turned out to be a huge trainwreck full of nonsensical design choices.

I don't think Frontiers can ever be more than a 7/10, and that's me putting on my big Sonic fan nostalgia glasses, by the way. I don't hate it, but I don't love it either. Managed to have some decent fun but I would not want to go back and replay it. That's about it.",,
"used to have a well written negative review here about the pop-in, the janky new characters, and frustrating difficulty. enough issues have been addressed that i gave it another shot and fell in love with the gameplay again. you might too!",,
This game has driven me to utter insanity. I am running in circles like an endless maze constantly being chased by a monster. i feel like im being ANNALY assulted. please delete this game off of steam forever no one should ahve to suffer through this hell. I hate you sega you peaked at sonic generatationsd you worthless piece of trash. why do you even exist anymore. this game makes me wanna kill myself more and more everyday. i am only playing it because my friend wants me to beat it ughghgruohtghuigrthikbjrtghjopthbjkghbkdjtl,,
"Loved the game when it first dropped, was just missing a couple of finishing touches...
Love the game even more after the finale of the 3rd update. THEY DELIVERED!

This is what happens when SONIC TEAM actually COOK!
We have a vibrant Blue Future ahead us. 💪",,
"After playing update 3 I can confidently say this is my favorite Sonic game to date. The base game I already loved a lot but with update 3, the new content skyrocketed it to my favorite Sonic game.

With what I'm saying I'll be referring exclusively to the new story and content added with update 3. With update 3 the new playable character are all really fun (with the exception of Knuckles who while is horrible, a lot of his moves and especially his glide feel very jank). Sonic is still the most fun and most polished character but for what the others offer they're fun. Update 3 had a large spike in difficulty compared to the base game which I can see why a lot of others are struggling with stuff like the tower climbs or trials. I actually quite enjoyed this higher difficulty presented and thought it wasn't that bad and was really fun with the exception of the Snake and Master King trials which I feel were a bit too strict with their requirements. However the towers imo should have check points for if you fall, using the parry i was able to catch myself not too far down and took my time as to not fall when doing these towers and had not many issues but I have seen a lot of people online who have fallen all the way down which I agree seems really annoying not sure why there weren't any checkpoints for these sections.

The final Island has been completely retooled for all the new characters which gives each one a lot of stuff to do, and even a lot of times if you know what you're doing you can launch of of the terrain or other platforms to get to some of these new objectives easier which is fun to experiment with. A big complaint though is after beating the new story, to switch characters you have to walk all the way back to Master King Koco which is really annoying, this should've just been something I can do anywhere. Finally the new final boss was everything I wanted, with the exception of it being unclear how to remove the bosses weak spot for a few tries till i randomly figured it out (use the bumpers to target the weak point), this final boss was cinematic, fun, and the new music was amazing. all the cutscenes and the final QTE attacks have lived in my head rent free since finishing it, I'm hoping going forward in the series all Super Sonic fights are similar to this and the other titan fights in the game.

The update was everything I wanted onto a game I already loved a lot, which I wont deny that the new content does have some jank here that definitely needed a bit more time to iron out and there and the difficulty spike was a bit surprising which could alienate some casuals. I think there could've been more time spent balancing everything but for me personally I already played frontiers a bunch and had a good handle of the controls so the difficulty was fun except for the few exceptions i said before. This whole final story with everything it's added is crazy that it's completely free where I feel most other franchises would've taken this opportunity to charge for something like this but them not doing that is really great and gives everyone a chance to play the true finale Frontiers always deserved.",,
"highly recommended if you're a sonic fan, especially after the dlc. Great boss music",,
Fine game. Gets very repetitive later on and Update 3 is kinda mid. Boss fights and story however is very awesome,,
"Product refunded

Great game, had a lot of fun with on the Switch, so why is the review negative? Yeah it's Denuvo, but it's also the optimization of this port. For whatever reason with my copy of the game there are these horrible lag spikes that cause the game to stutter and freeze for 7 seconds at a time and cause my CPU usage to go up to 100%, making my whole computer unusable during it. I have tried everything I could to fix it, but to no avail, even contacted SEGA support only to get tips that I could of just googled and done in less than a day rather than almost of week of back and forward emails, Almost didn't get a refund because of how long I took trying to troubleshoot the game. My specs are at the very least in the minimum requirements and just nearly hit the recommended requirements, the game even ran at around 50-60 fps on high settings whenever it wasn't having a stroke trying to have Sonic run around some unreal asset island or Sonic Generations assets. The only thing I can think of that is causing the game to do this is bad optimization or Denuvo DRM, maybe both, who knows, I'm not a game developer and I haven't played newer PC games for a while since I didn't have the hardware to do so until now.

Overall, I'd recommend people to be wary when buying this game and if you have the same issue I did, just refund the game, there is no fix for it and I'd doubt there's going to be patch for it given how only a handful of people seem to have gotten it, even people who have pretty beefy specs have apparently gotten the same issue, which is ridiculous because a game that looks like this shouldn't be having these kind of issues. I'll probably be staying away from any games with Denuvo DRM in them for the foreseeable future to avoid this from ever happening to me again.

My specs for people who care so they can laugh at me or whatever.

This is the definitive way to play Sonic. Easily the best Sonic game since Sonic Generations.,,
"Man I love TouHou

The game was fine, and then the DLC came out. Stupid tower platforming and poorly explained final boss. Was considering cease to breathing throughout the DLC.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is, by far, the best 3D Sonic Game since the Adventure duo. This is easily one of my top five Sonic games of all time: a masterpiece of everything the fans want, mixed with fun platforming, and a laid back but fun to master control system.

Do not play Update 3. It is the exact opposite.",,
"I absolutely love the gameplay, combat, bosses, music, and general experience and would have loved to have been enjoying it since launch. But I haven't been able to properly enjoy any of this for ONE SOLE REASON: lag and stuttering. For some abysmal reason, this game has the immense proclivity to stutter and lag and sometimes just seize up repeatedly and consistently on my machine, that at one point was entirely fine running it. And I can't for the life of me figure out what is going wrong. I've checked and rechecked my machine and the game's files, even going so far as to reinstall my OS, but NOTHING i do seems to fix the problem. it falters in cutscenes, it falters in Cyberspace Stages, it happens in all forms of Combat, in the Overworld, and there is seemingly NO FIX.

In a game that hinges upon Immersion, easy and fun traversal, and exploration, this kind of flaw stands out like a giant flashing weak point on a boss. Like a spotlight in a dark field. It doesn't always happen at the same intervals, but whenever it rears its ugly head, it COMPLETELY ruins all the fun I was having prior.

If you feel confident you can enjoy it and disregard this glaring flaw, i would fully recommend this game, as its probably the best Sonic game we've gotten in years. But until Sega gets it together and stabilizes this thing, I will have to put myself in even greater agony and just not recommend this otherwise great game.",,
"This game is a genuine triumph and I loved nearly every minute of it. Sonic is back and I as a fan couldn't be more proud of Sonic Team for pulling through despite all that was against them.
The game is a semi-open-world adventure in the style of something like Mario Odyssey, with plenty of collectibles on multiple main worlds and their own stories. The story, unlike most sonic games after 2008, was actually well written and it was nice seeing an arc carry over from the comics and attempt to connect the greater sonic canon together.
Overall, this was a lovely treat for a Sonic fan like me and is a good time for even non-sonic fans. My girlfriend played it on Switch and had a wonderful time. Give it a shot, you won't regret it.
8.5/10",,
"This game makes open world gaming actually enjoyable allowing for free movement and faster traversal than any other open world game out there. Cyberspace while limited in terms of creative level themes at least brings back good level design (something forces lacked) with some cool (somewhat intentional) speedrunning tech. Puzzle solving is fun, boss fights are flashy backed up by and Epic soundtrack. General combat is very engaging, while not difficult it's very fun to wail on enemies by chaining combos together. Over all a very fun game and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes playing mechanically fun video games. This version especially will be something truly special with Modding which will keep this game active for years to come!!!",,
"No time for a detailed review so I give this game a rank A.
Great game - you should definitely do it!!
See my profile for more details about my reviews.

Additional notes: TLDR for Sonic lovers since day 1 like me or Sonic Adventures fans- buy it, it is not perfect but the best Sonic in years.
Now, for everyone else: color me surprised (pun intended)! After Sonic Colors (not bad) and Sonic Generations (pretty cool, my most recent ""good"" Sonic among all the mediocre games Sonic Team did), I did not think this one would work. The idea on paper seemed amazing, but the screenshots and videos show what you get. Indeed, it is truthfully imperfect, so many things are still flawed. BUT! if you read this and you used to love Sonic since Genesis, and loved the Dreamcast experience, hear me out: Sonic Frontiers is the closest game to Sonic Adventure to date. If you want to relieve that experience, this is the one. Unfortunately, I still think they had great ideas, but not enough budget/inspiration/time/ambition, pick your answer. This game could have been an AMAZING game if the open world part had been more inspired and immersive.
As it is? imagine a (fake..) open world that is just a huge Hub with mini stunts places (like, mini, between 5 seconds to 30 seconds each), all spread out throughout the map, Assassin Creed style (and all the likes) where you need to grind and activate towers to reveal the map, reveal the various icons, gather EVERYTHING on the map, etc. Make 4 maps like that, call them islands, these are the hubs where you spend 50 hours gathering everything. Now, why do I call them hub? because basically, in each of these maps, you have like ~7 portals that lead you to... the actual, typical Sonic levels. Half of them are 2D (Sonic trilogy style) while the other half is 3D (Sonic Adventure/Colors/Generations) style. But that's it, they are still called 1-1, 1-2, 1-3 or 4-1, 4-2, 4-3 etc. With time trials, emeralds gathering, etc. They took out the mini-bosses from these levels and put them in the open world maps instead.
Talking about the enemy/character design, very uninspired - ethereal/mecha, more than robotic. And why? because this is not about Robotnik/Eggman anymore, but more about digital/cyber/SF stuff... that is a bit sad.
The game is LARGELY inspired by Breath of the Wild, which is obvious seeing the impact it had in Japan (and overseas), without the clean quality of it though. You basically have to find and beat the 4 big giant bosses controlled by ancient heroes... you have little challenges here and there with weird puzzles... every few in-game days you have a red mo- sorry
I meant a ""shooting star night"" and all the enemies are reset... you need to find blue upgrades for your stamina bar (in circles..) and red upgrades for your hea- sorry I meant your ""speed/rings health system""... you still have the equivalence for the little Chaos creatures called Kocos (not korok...) that you have to find by hundreds on each map... and bring them back to the ""elder"" koco... (no he does not have maracas or dance moves...)... so, yeah, the similarities are numerous like this, not plagiarism but huge inspiration for sure.
All the rest is a mix of great design, and very poor choices:
Cameras are still between awesome and a nightmare. The musics are still between awesome (remix of old themes, very 90s japan dance - imagine Sonic CD style) and awful (boss music is garbage pseudo-metal, punk, Sonic Adventure Open Your Heart style).
Level design is between awesome (super hard S-rank time trials in 2D or 3D where you restart 30 times to have the perfect run) and soporific (open world map is mostly... boring).
Graphics and visuals are between awesome (most X-X traditional levels, 2D or 3D are REALLY cool) and plainly uninspired (open world map again, so ugly, clipping everywhere, boring textures and assets, empty world). I mean, just type ""Sonic Frontiers Levels"" to see some amazing screenshots, and ""Sonic Frontiers Chaos Island"" to see the difference with an awful environment...
Finally, the story? ranges from great ideas (where did the blue creature Chaos from Sonic Adventure with its weird moving heart come from? could we make Robotnik care for someone or something?) to plain boring and soporific (can not care for Sage, and usual partners Tails/Knuckles/Amy are simply useless). A weird Evangelion and cosmic mecha on top of it, and you get the idea: you will stay in this game for the rides and loops, not for the narration... even Sonic Adventure was better, that says a lot.

But overall? It was super cool! If I had more time I would S-rank everything (only did world 1 so far), because it is REALLY cool, and the game design, while weird and clunky at first (and all throughout) starts to make sense the more you play, and if you accept their old-school awkward design (I would bet money most of these designers are 40yo+ japanese dudes) you end up having lots of fun. Buy on sale, but DO IT if you are a Sonic fan since childhood like me!",,
sonic,,
"best new sonic game in years , i dont rlly like open world games bc i get stuck or bored but this is my favourite
there is always something to do :D",,
i like blue rat go fast,,
the game itself is amazing it will take hours for me to finish but i like it anyways. Being a sonic fan really brings happiness. Cant wait for the update!,,
"Fun game, but you need to mod it to unlock its potential",,
Defintly would recommend to those who have not played a sonic title in a while or those who want to hop into the series. The mod support alone makes this game worthwhile,,
"Cyber Space is an amazing breath of fresh air for 3D Sonic, it's really fun once you learn it.

Oh, and the Open Zone is cool too I guess",,
"Great game, at first i wasn't sure to play this as i have stopped after generations.
At first it's quite alot and i wasn't sure how to progress, but after progressing 75% through the game, i got more used to it and knew where what my goals were. I also completed the game (only game stuff, no extra rush things).
I would recommend this game, even tho the overworld with all it's springs, rings, jump rings etc get repetitive at some point.
I wouldn't advice to complete it (or atleast, don't collect everything on every island, tottaly not worth it + ya don't get an achievement for it, only a silly crown...)

Curious what sonic team will bring next, as this game was way more seriously toned, matured and very open. Ending was good/great (i was spoiled), epiloge was great too!",,
"-- OVERALL --
Some fans have suggested this game is ""Sonic meets 'Breath of the Wild'."" It's not. It is effectively Sonic Adventure 1 meets Shadow of the Colossus: Sonic's 2D and 3D gameplay in an ""open zone"", with large minibosses roaming and bosses with an associated climbing puzzle before they can be defeated. Besides that, the game is also a realignment for the series to establish what direction future ""Modern Sonic"" games will take.

I greatly enjoyed my time playing the game, issues with the one main bug aside, and recommend it strongly, especially after the first two waves of free DLC.
- GAMEPLAY: A positive and streamlined direction for future Sonic games. ""Let them cook.""
- GAME LENGTH: 20 Hrs / 45+ Hrs
- STORY: Simple but finally addresses overdue concerns.
- GRAPHICS: Self evident, but, see bugs.
- AUDIO: Varied and extensive. Not all parts are for all tastes.
- BUGS: Pop-in is quite bad and noticeable, but bugs here don't impact fun.
- ADDITIONAL FEATURES: Free DLC helps clarify what this game was going for at launch and adds a lot of depth.

-- GAMEPLAY --
""Sonic Adventure 1 meets Shadow of the Colossus"", as described above. The game is set on a series of ""Open Zone"" areas, which feature plotted 2D and 3D platforming areas, as well as open world physics connecting it all together. The plotted areas are not necessary for completion, but are there as an intended path to get some of the core collectibles. Difficulty levels can be adjusted at any time, but this affects enemies, not anything platforming related or time requirements.

The core gameplay loop is:
1) Explore the Open Zone to find platforming challenges and Cyberspace's special Acts .
2) Gather certain items to progress in the story, either by completing platforming challenges, battling enemies, lucky finds, or a certain mini-game that makes collection much easier.
3) Complete certain puzzles and mini-games throughout story progression.
4) End of zone boss.
5) Repeat in the next open zone.

Besides the above, there are also several required minigames with very different gameplay heavily inspired by Ikaruga, and lightly similar to certain other bosses and events throughout Sonic history. Not everyone may like this, but I found them fun to play.

-- GAME LENGTH --
Core: ------------------- 20-30 hours
100% Achievements: -- 25-35 hours
Full Game Completion: 45+ hours
At release, a single playthrough of the base game is about 20-30 hours when not speedrunning, and playing at the intended pace. This is longer than most other Sonic games on its own. The game does include 3 waves of free DLC, which significantly increase the game's depth, and make the intended play patterns more clear. Some of the content has been retroactively added to the base game, so while that hasn't been factored into core game time, it has been factored into Completion time.

-- STORY --
Sonic goes to some new islands and learns about a new supporting character and several questions about the series' myth arc. Several of the major side characters get much needed character exploration, but some of that is in optional side missions.

Beyond that, the game contains several clear and intentional homages to , but not in a way that seems too out of place for a Sonic game.

-- GRAPHICS --
For the most part, you can judge for yourself based on the store images. However, there is a bit more to be said: Gameplay takes place in two sets of four environments: the Open Zone worlds have one set, and the Cyberspace stages have another set. Frustratingly, the Cyberspace stages continue the trend of recycling assets from Green Hill, Chemical Plant, and Sky Sanctuary, and not nearly in a creative way like Forces did. Furthermore, the main bug in the game is a graphical one, see below.

-- AUDIO --
This game varies from traditional Sonic music in three different directions. Open Zone music is atmospheric and orchestral. Cyberspace's music is EDM inspired. Major bosses are metalcore (some could say ""screamo""). I prefer the first two, and find the latter not to be in my tastes.

As of the second wave of DLC, there are over 70 additional music tracks, most of which come from franchise history and fit a variety of genres, eras, and stage themes. Most of these are unlocked by doing Open Zone platforming.

-- BUGS --
Pop-In. The game's worst bug. Thanks to Sonic's speed and the Open Zone design, there's a lot of assets to load, and most of them load very noticeably by popping in. If you're having fun with the core gameplay, it's less noticeable, but still annoying. At times it can be quite distracting. As of writing, it remains to be seen if this will be fixed by patches or mods.

-- ADDITIONAL FEATURES --
The Homing Dash glitch, a now officially recognized feature, greatly aids speedrunning and replayability.

A minigame: Required for achievement completion and 100% completion. A nice and relaxing way to pass time, and the only way to unlock a certain character's character exploration. However this is also a very easy way to breeze through the game's collection routes for story items and stat boosts.

Arcade Mode: An easy way to replay the Cyberspace stages, with leaderboards.

Shortly after launch, 3 waves of free DLC were announced, which launched after I completed the base game. Waves 1 and 2 effectively doubled my play time in the game, and both were completed or nearly completed prior to this review. I'd have recommended the game even beforehand, but recommend it more strongly afterwards. A lot of the content clarifies and streamlines how Open Zone platforming is supposed to be done, and rewards you for doing so, while some other content unlocks postgame modes. The main DLC and the associated rewards are:

- Cyberspace Rush: A gauntlet of the Cyberspace stages. Reward:

- Battle Rush: A gauntlet of most of the Open Zone enemies, mini-bosses, and bosses. Reward:

- ""New Koco"": Missions similar to Adventure 2's ""Find the Lost Chao"" stages. Reward:

- Open Zone Challenge: Score attack for the Open Zone. Reward:",,
"Let's Dive Into The Crazy World of Sonic Frontiers!

This game is a rollercoaster of emotions for me. On one hand, it's a mess with its fair share of frustrations. But on the other hand, it's undeniably fun in its own chaotic way.

The story starts with a bang as Dr. Eggman and Sonic's pals get sucked into a portal. As Sonic, your mission is to free your friends, help some smiley rock creatures called Kocos, and stop Dr. Eggman's evil plans. Simple, right?

You'll navigate through open zones, not quite an open world like Breath of the Wild, but more like Mario Odyssey. These zones are vast and filled with fog of war that you gradually uncover as you explore. It's a collectathon, and there's a certain joy in gathering tokens and skill shards while zipping around on rails and listening to the excellent drum and bass tracks.

But here's the catch: the game can be seriously directionless. The rails and platforming bits often send you flying in all sorts of directions, leaving you a bit disoriented. And when you need to reach specific places, it can be quite the challenge to get there without being flung off course.

The Cyberspace levels provide a more traditional Sonic experience, and they're a mixed bag. They showcase the game's janky nature but are still a lot of fun, especially with their catchy music.

Boss fights, however, are a necessary evil. They highlight the game's flaws, and Sonic's lack of precision becomes apparent when combat is mixed with fast platforming.

Despite its quirks and repetition, Sonic Frontiers has potential. It's a fun foundation for a sequel that just needs some fine-tuning to reach its full superpower. So, if you're up for some scrappy fun and can handle a bit of frustration, Sonic Frontiers might just be the wild ride you're looking for.",,

"AFTER DLC 3 REVIEW:

Without getting into spoilers, update 3 easily makes this one of the best Sonic games ever created. Not only did they fix the ending, but they also exceeded expectations with the final boss. No joke, Supreme went from a joke as the worst boss in the game into one of the best IF NOT THE BEST Sonic boss in the entire franchise. My only gripe with this update is just how much of a kick to the balls it is in terms of difficulty (no seriously, its challenges are genuinely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥). This game still has its many issues... but I don't even care anymore. I'm more than happy to give this game an official 8/10 from me. Thank you Sonic Team and SEGA for letting this game fulfill its potential.


BEFORE UPDATE 3 REVIEW:

After Forces, literally anything would've been an immediate upgrade. But I gotta say, Sonic Frontiers was a surprisingly enjoyable game. It has its many flaws but overall, I'm happy to say that this is the best Sonic game this past decade. After 100%ing this game, I have a lot to say. This review will contain some spoilers, so for now, my rating of the game is a 6/10. If you like Sonic or have liked Sonic in the past, I recommend this game.

To start off, Sonic controls great during the open-zone gameplay. I'd say that 90% of the time, he's very responsive. But sometimes things will get infuriating REALLY quickly. Wall running in this game gives me nightmares that I don't think I can recover from. Also, there's one specific Koco on the first island of the game that legitimately gave me an aneurysm (if you've played the new DLC, you know exactly what Koco I'm talking about). Still, for the most part, Sonic controls pretty well in the open-zone.

The level design in most of the cyberspace stages are very fun, but Sonic's controls here do NOT do it justice. I have no idea how this game goes from controlling exceptionally well to baby's first steps on a slip-n-slide. Sonic does not control well AT ALL in cyberspace. I don't have much else to say about the cyberspace levels because I skipped all of them at any chance I got. I only played through all of them to get 100% completion.

The dialogue in this game was a delightful surprise. The characterization present in every cutscene in this game put a smile on my face. Sonic and the gang actually felt real instead of cardboard cutouts present all over Forces. Still, there are a lot of ""side-story"" ""cutscenes"" that are just the two characters talking to each other as the camera keeps cutting to whoever's speaking. But for the most part, the main cutscenes that you HAVE to watch to progress are still enjoyable. Tails' arc on the third island was 100% my favorite in regards to said characterization. I may be a little biased since Tails has always been my favorite of the whole gang since I was a kid, but I won't deny that the writers have kind of been doing him dirty for the past decade or so. Well, I’m happy to say that they did the unthinkable and made Tails a likable character again. When Sonic said, ""I guess you just grew up on me a little faster than I expected,"" I felt tears welling up in my eyes and I got chills down my spine. It's a shame that the best parts of the story are locked behind the worst island in the game, but I digress. Tails' story may have been my favorite in the entire game, but that’s not to say that Knuckles and Amy don’t have their amazing moments as well.

As for the actual story, I thought it was serviceable, even if a little underwhelming by the end. I really hope DLC 3’s new story overhauls the entire ending to the game because it left a sour impression on me. This game could easily be a 7/10 if not an 8/10 for me if they fix the ending. The story has so much potential for an exciting climax, but as of DLC 2, the story’s ending is a dud.

Stories in Sonic games aren’t created equal, but the music usually is, and I am so happy to say that Frontiers’ soundtrack is… OH! MY!! GOD!!! The music was the sole reason why I even bought this game. The titan themes in this game need absolutely no introduction. They are just the definition of energetic bad-ass anthems. They singlehandedly CARRY the boss fights. Even the cyberspace songs were highly enjoyable. This review is already getting really long, so I won’t dabble too much into the music here. It’s a Sonic game, you KNOW it’s good.

Sonic Frontiers is a game that I (clearly) have a lot to say about, which is more than a lot of Sonic games in the past can say for themselves. For the first time in a while, I could feel the passion emanating from everyone involved in this project. I have my issues with this game, and I may only be giving this game a 6/10, but keep in mind that this review is coming out before a FREE story rework. After that, this could easily be a 7/10 or 8/10 game. I just really hope that all this positive momentum will carry on far into the future.

If you’ve read this far, you are amazing and I wish you a good day :)",,

This game has your standard Generations-style boost levels that are all throwbacks to previous beloved levels in Sonic games, many of which weren't even featured in Generations, like Mission Street from SA2. All of the levels are short and sweet, the design is fun and engaging, and the red rings aren't hidden by sadists like they were in Generations. They're just easy enough that it's extremely fun to 100% each level with an S rank, and I tend to go for it whenever I play one.

But that's the key word, ""whenever."" Because this game doesn't emphasize or really require you to play too many actual levels. Between levels, and dare I say for the majority of this game should you choose to play it this way, there's an entire overworld packed with collectibles and challenges. It has the design of Breath of the Wild with the content density of a Yakuza game, and feels like a huge playground for you to just enjoy the Sonic moveset in. It's not buggy like usual in Sonic games, and when it is the bugs tend to be less ""die because you fell through the floor"" and more ""shoot into the stratosphere at lightning speed and have fun trying to see what you can do with that."" Like the levels, this is also optional. You can play a lot of this game by just going from objective to objective and skipping all the overworld stuff.

Overall, this game values player experience over the usual Sonic crap, and that's why it's probably the best in the series.",,
"While update 3 feels more like a testrun/beta for the next Sonic game,Frontiers is still worth your time and money,specially if you're a 3D platformer or a Sonic fan
Fast paced open world platforming,great atmosphere,puzzles,combat,epic boss fights,incredible music and a surprisingly good story with great themes and character moments
Just expect the usual sonic jank which is a given when it comes to this franchise these days",,
"!!! MINOR SPOILER WARNING!!! (The game's been out for a year, if you haven't played it by now... what are you waiting for!? Go play it!)

Now, On to the review!!!

THIS is a game that despite it's flaws continues to get better and better and BETTER.

Sonic Frontiers is a game full of grand spectacle and a story unlike anything we've ever seen from ANY Sonic game so far.
(Except the comics. Random Trivia: a comic book writer WROTE the story for this game!)

While I waited til some of the DLC dropped to give my review on this title, I'll be updating my thoughts when DLC 3 drops but for now this is a review of the base game and DLC 2.

Sonic controls brilliantly in the open zone, and the game gives the players a lot of options on how to control their perfect version of Sonic. I like to go FAST so all my options were cranked to max, focused on speed and the difficulty on Hard. The Combat while it can get button mashy.. (most 3d hack and slash and combat focused games get like this.) Is actually quite enjoyable to watch as it is to play. Even though it can get mashy... there is a level of strategy to fighting enemies that I quite enjoy, as you just can't run in with your fists swinging... you will get smacked and your rings will get thrown. I haven't seen Sonic kick so much ass since Sonic Battle and ACTUAL Sonic fighting game. (Sonic the Fighters would like to have a word with me.) Is it better than Sonic the Werehog?? Wellll..... I still kinda stan the werehog.... BUT the combat in this game is much quicker and less repetitive.

The story was very compelling and had a lot of emotion and character growth. Some side-story cutscenes leave a lot to be desired especially in the visual department, some characters looking really stiff, but the main story driven cutscenes were phenomenal. The animation was fluid and the characters displayed genuine emotion. I wanna see more of Sonic and Knuckles just being bro's. That was so adorable!! My boys are good friends!! Anyway gushing aside...Amy's love story, Knuckles realizing he doesn't always have to be a thug about it, and Tails's redemption arc.. Oh man Tails's redemption arc. There was Sage realizing that there's more to Sonic than just her father Dr.Eggman hating him. Eggman and Sonic having to join forces to overcome a bigger threat akin to the threatening situation in Sonic Adventure 2. It was great. There were some pacing issues at some points. The plot where Sonic's cyber corruption taking a toll on him was handled great in some cases but not so great in others. Like when he succumbs to the effects of being corrupted. He was in genuine pain. I've never heard or seen him so messed up. Then literally the next few seconds his friends save him somehow and he's fine... Like I would have loved to have seen that explored a bit more. How did his friends help him? Did they each take on bits of his cyber corruption? Did they find his soul and bring it back to the surface? What happened? (Remember the scene from 06 where his friends each explore null space and recover Sonic's soul? Why can't we do that!?)

Overall the story is pretty neat! Lots of call backs, basically all the games are canon. They even have Sticks the Badger in their universe!

Hard mode earns you a slightly different ending with the final boss that you have to fight like a 2D shooter style boss. It was tough... I game over'd many times til I just got good and didn't get hit. You're only given 2 lives to beat the boss. It came off as slightly underwhelming but I still enjoy that we had to work hard for the ending. I had a feeling that since we already knew from the start that we'll be getting more DLC that they'll address the issues we have with the final boss that eventually and we'll get an overall much better experience with the game as a whole.

Cyberspace.... so some say its the weakest part of the game. I will have to HARD disagree. I enjoy the more traditional style Sonic levels. (That doesn't mean I hate the open zone. The open zone was definitely the right choice in being the main focus!) While Sonic doesn't control as well as he does in the open zone.... they're still fun to play and if you've mastered the ""Griddy"" aka ""Magnet Dash"" aka the official name for this technique the ""Homing Dash"" (I like Griddy more.) you'll have an even MORE fun time with the Cyberspace levels!

Now that DLC 2 is out... and oh man is this a really good celebration for Sonic's 32nd Birthday. The decor, the birthday event and the unlockables! This heavily reminds me of the event DLC we used to get in Sonic Adventure on the Dreamcast. Like this update is FULL of neat stuff. The extra missions like the Koco Challenges and the Island challenges that they give you makes me feel nostalgic in a good way. Remember when Sonic Adventure DX had mission mode? It's like that but better. (I had Mystic Ruins playing in Kronos Island tinting my rose tinted nostalgia glasses even more.) And your reward? Extra boost gauges and the Spindash... Oh god the SPINDASH!!!! I recommend doing the Island challenges first as soon as you can. The spindash reward is so worth it.

Anyone who says spindash and boost cannot work together in a Sonic game NEEDS to play this. It is SO MUCH FUN!!!
(PLEASE SEGA DON'T NERF THE SPINDASH IN UPDATE 3... PLEASE!!!)

One of my biggest gripes about this game was that while the game is great, the physics could use some work..... the spindash makes me forget all about that. If you rev it up and let go at a ramp YOU ARE FLYING!!!!! I LOVE THIS! The momentum you get from that is absolutely amazing! Also they give you the ability to maintain boost while jumping. Do yourself a favor and turn that one on chief. As well as cranking jump deceleration down. You will ACTUALLY HAVE MOMENTUM to your jumps and it feels great! It feels like Adventure Spindash and Lost World's Spindash combined! You pair this up with the boost ability and you've got a recipe for literal fun.


Overall Sonic Frontiers, is a very ambitious title that has it's flaws, it does more right that it does wrong. Is it a perfect game? Absolutely not, But for what we've been given this is an absolutely stellar title and it gets even better as more DLC is released. (FOR FREE MIGHT I ADD!)

Before the DLC, I'd give it a 7.5/10.
After the DLC, it's a 8.5/10 for me. It really feels like there's no where to go but up with this game and I'm all for it!",,
sucks,,
This is one of the best sonic games i have ever played in my life,,
blooby guy,,
"I WISH ITS FREE
AND EVREONE HAS FUN",,
while the game is a little rough around the edges its by far my favorite Sonic of all time (right next to sonic advance and SA) the fact that we have a sonic game where you get to free roam listing to your favorite songs from past games is a dream come true. its not perfect but its a Sonic fans dream come true with the best combat we have gotten for sonic in any game. i can only hope that the next 3d sonic game improves on this to make a even better game! 9/10,,
Sonic has had a long history in gaming and while I have enjoyed most entries in the series from the early 2000's it was obvious that the game was declining in quality over the years. This game shows that sonic team still has potential and still has the ability to make a good and welcomed entry into the series. While the gameplay loop can be repetitive I have to admit that there is potential in there for better mechanics to be had. I hope that sega learns from this game and will only improve an already good game.,,
"If you love a blue speedy hedgehog then this is the game for you the combat is really fun and the boss battles are amazing especially with a soundtrack that makes you feel like bad ass and even when running around doing quests you get to listen to songs like I'm Here, Sonic Heroes theme and more if that sounds like your type of game then you should get it right now",,
"Frontiers is Sonic's first foray into the now ubiquitous open world adventure and I personally think it was a refresher after the last couple of games' functional but middling status. Though it has problems in the way it goes about it and is definitely a first attempt, it's a stepping stone in the right direction for Sonic Team.

The open world (or rather worlds) itself, the Starfall Islands, while generic, is fairly tightly designed and the core gameplay loop is engaging. Sonic handles like a dream in the open world and he feels faster than he ever has once maxed out. Though each island overstays its welcome a little bit, it's not quite enough to really bring it down. Overall solid for a first attempt at this sort of style.

Individual stages, the old core of the franchise, are now relegated as (mostly) optional content that you have the option to skip over if you play your cards right, and they're... okay. I have my problems with how Sonic handles in the normal platforming stages and they're pretty blatant in the content recycling (Even if the game does have a reasonable explanation for why this is the case). These are mostly older stages with assets from Sonic Generations and I'm getting just a bit tired of seeing Green Hill and Chemical Plant in nearly every game since.

Going back to the combat focused approach that was big in the mid-late 2000s Sonic games, it did this pretty well if you ask me. The combat doesn't feel out of place and blends into the core gameplay loop nicely. The skill tree gives the combat some different visual flair but aside from a few bosses each of the combos feel similar to me. This specific aspect I feel could potentially be expanded upon, but I realize that going too far could reintroduce the problems the older combat focused approach had in the first place.

Music and presentation are all really solid, and visuals are stepped up to a new high. This actually managed to give my 2060 Super a solid run in certain areas when maxed out at 1440p while recording at 1440p, which I was not expecting at all. That being said I would not call this unoptimized, the hardware usage is earned.

Story is pretty standard, and I'm not gonna say anything about it here, but the overall writing has improved tenfold from the last 12 years of games in the series. Ian Flynn headed this one and you can tell he brought his enthusiasm and experience from the IDW comics into this game's story and writing. It does have the slight problem of not being as accessible to new fans, this game is filled with actually justifiable (mostly) references.

Overall, a solid game that, while not perfect, is still more than worth the purchase. Would absolutely recommend this.",,
"very refreshing to see Sonic being experimented with different game genre open worlds suits well I would say with high mobility and 3D-2D platforming the ending was mediocre and the game being fairly easy the newest free update fixed everything wrong with the game plus adding free content something that games these days don't do, I would rate it as a 8/10 but I might be biased.",,
Truly a next level story for fans of Sonic the Hedgehog.,,
"cyberspace feels like i have a flat tire, the rest of the game is incredible though",,
pretty cool game,,
"Product received for free

This game is G.O.A.T.E.D!",,
It gave me an auditive orgasm with that GODLY music for my metal head ass 10/10,,
"The only game I have that you can fish to become overpowered.

froggy/10",,
"A great sonic game.
The islands are fun to run around in, the movement feels great and the combat is solid and fun.
The story has enough depth and the characters are well written. They go through a journey and face challenges, while expanding on the Sonic Lore.
The game has a lot of content and it`s just a blast",,
"what an incredible game. this is how open world games should be done. games like breath of the wild can learn from this. instead of trying to slow you down with bloat and things to stop you being able to move on to the next thing (like durability) this game allow you to tackle things in any way you want, if you dont like one part of the game you can do something else to get the games resource to upgrade or move on etc.
Wanna get more attack, do a challenge style dungeon speedrun, dont like that, go kill a cool mini boss instead or any other number of ways to get that attack upgrade than you not limited to in any way.
This is open world done right as you can actually 100% the game without having to collect everything since there essentially infinite ways to get stuff... hell you can upgrade fully by just doing hrs of fishing.
As for the sonic world, wow this is the game ive been waiting for for decades as a sonic fan, good story, good visuals, good gameplay and so many cool references and amazing music.
10/10 best games ive played for years, i want a more",,
"Over 100 hours on Switch, glad I can play it again in higher graphic settings, this game visual looks stunning, of course it would beats the Switch version I own. Anyway, a good game, critics like it, fans love it, I am proud.",,
"The irritation that came with finishing this game was high. I grew up on Sonic, owning a Genesis when it first released. I remember loving the originals, lots of fond memories experiencing Sonic on not just the Sega Genesis but also Game Gear and even the Dreamcast. I went in to Frontiers with my head held high, excited for a great modern day adventure with the Blue Blur only to be disappointed from the very beginning. For starters the graphics are just terrible. Perhaps I hadn't paid enough attention to trailers and screenshots, however the screenshots themselves can appear a bit deceptive especially depending on particular areas in the game. Additionally, the frame rate cap at 60 was a huge surprise, and the cutscenes were even worse, almost looking like they were rendered as low as 24fps. The quality of cutscenes seemed to border too close to late 90's CGI, this game essentially felt and ran like it was an early concept demo. Nothing about the environment was interesting, no characters to interact with, and definitely no story, the pathways to run and objects to use for traversal don't load on the screen until you're 10ft away, creating a ridiculous amount of pop-in and choppiness to what should look much more fluid. In addition to the game feeling completely empty and without purpose, the objectives are nothing but the same unnecessary tedious collect-a-thon from the very beginning. Controls get clunky when they should be tight for the speed of the game, also be prepared for some terribly designed cheap shots during boss battles. I've seen radically more effort put into products from smaller indie and single-staffed game studios, for an iconic character like Sonic to turn out this way was abysmal. The only reason I powered through to the end was because of pure nostalgia mixed with a determination to just get it done.",,
"Sonic Frontiers
is a big step in the right direction.

While it might be as good as the Sonic Adventure games or the classics, Sonic Frontiers goes where no Sonic game has gone before: Open World . If you are a Sonic fan, you've probably already picked this one up. If you aren't a fan or are not sure about purchasing, perhaps wait for a sale. The game is definitely more of an... experiment, but after the abomination that is Sonic Forces, this is a massive upgrade. It is such a breath of fresh air to just run out into the open as sonic and realize, ""Wow I can literally go run to the other side of an island and explore. Gotta go fast right?"" This is not a masterpiece by any means, nor is it an amazing game but I think by the end, you'd have enjoyed your time.

Pros:
- Open World
- Environments
- Soundtrack
- Boss Fights
- Combat
- Content


Cons:
- Repetitive Objectives
- Cyber Space Levels are Horrible, except for maybe one
- Leveling system is weird and did not make much of an impact
- Rails just floating in air is kinda weird too. At least have them connected to platforms or maybe to trees or something.
- No momentum sucks too.


Overall, Frontiers is a step in the right direction and the next mainline Sonic game could be fantastic. Imagine Sonic Adventure 2 but open world? Cmon Sega just do Sonic Adventure 3 and make it open world.",,
"an ok game but the forced 2D sections are annoying and trash. moreover chaos island is the worst island, it took away all the fun i had here.",,
he goes fast and thats all he needs to do. 10/10 i wish hedgehogs were real,,
"I'm not good at words, but as a life-long fan of Sonic who has watched the series rise and fall, then rise, then... fall again(...), this is a pretty good start to a new era of the series. Overall had a lot of fun with this.

The open world is honestly pretty fun to mess around in, the soundtrack is insane, and the cyberspace levels are... hit or miss in my opinion.

Too many things that you are encouraged to do just kill your speed for no reason. Homing attacks need to be quick and snappy like they used to be, light dash needs to not stop you in your tracks at the end, landing after an air dash while still holding boost should keep you boosting, jumps are very floaty and hard to control. There's probably more that i'm not remembering right now.

I truly think Sonic Team can and will take feedback to heart and give us an even better game next time, which again this one is pretty good.",,
"Because this is my first steam review I'm gonna be short and to the point:

This Game is not amazing AT ALL but i enjoyed it A LOT. (30 Hours as of now)
it's easily GOTY-Tier compared to sonic games past unleashed.
""It's far from perfect it's not even great; but it is good.""
- Juan Ortiz

-Story is really good thanks to Ian Flynn
special points for characterization and dialogues.

-Gameplay can be really fun but janky at times
Cyberspace is mostly bad especially when it comes to 2d levels
but it can be fun, although it can never be as good as Unleashed
because of the uninspired level themes and their length.

-Openworld design is Overall mid
It can be really good at times but sometimes it's bland or even worse garbage (Chaos Island)
but when all gears are in place it can be really fun.

-Visuals are good overall, enemy designs are good as well.
Animations can be sometimes non-existent but i don't expect anything more.

-Combat is overall simple and button-mashy but it is not horrible; and can be enjoyable at times.
Some of the Guardian fights can drag a lot though.

-Titan Fights Specially Giganto And Knight Are Spectacular
The Final Boss on the other hand... Just no.

-Music is BEYOND THIS WORLD.

Just use mods becuase why the hell would you play it on PC if not for the mods?

"The ProsFirst things first, the game is just fun. It’s fun to run around, make cyclops, kill enemies, collect items, grind rails, all while in an open space. Sonic works really well in an open world setting makes me wonder why Sonic Team chose to keep him in hallways for the past 2 decades. I also like the story and writing. None of the dialog feels forced and the characters have natural chemistry. The writing isn’t Twin Peaks or anything but it’s still leagues better then the writing seen in Colors, Generations, Lost World, and Forces oh especially Forces. It’s just nice seeing the characters interact. And unlike previous games the zaniness has been toned down considerably. It’s still here with Sonic making quips from time to time but it isn’t so much that it’s annoying. And I feel like this tone change is shown the best in Sonic’s voice direction. Roger Craig Smith has tweaked the Sonic voice going for a more deeper and mellow type voice. Seems like he’s trying to match Jason Griffith’s performance. Sonic has mellowed out over the years, no longer this impatient wise cracking guy. He still makes quips but it’s no longer his entire personality. I like this a lot. Sage is also a good character, she’s actually being built up and given more of a personality unlike another Sonic villain who is red and black. The platforming sections can be annoying at times but otherwise still fun since if you can do it without messing up then it’s super satisfying. The combat is also really good. It can be button mashy at times but I’ve 100% Spiderman PS4 so I don’t mind. This game really does share a lot with Spiderman PS4: the combat, skill points to get new abilities, the puzzle map system. Speaking of the puzzle map system is also fun. The puzzles aren’t anything too hard the worst they’re repetitive or they don’t really give you a clear idea on how to trigger them but still pretty fun and super rewarding when you do finally realize what to do and beat them up.I also like the music, Sonic games no matter the quality always have banger music and this game continues that trend…. At least when the music isn’t screaming at me. Listen Ik music is subjective and rock n roll isn’t that bad but who seriously finds this enjoyable?Show clip of me playing the song with my super realistic faceAnother pro is the camera. THANK GOD THE CAMERA DOESN’T SUCK. Any game can make it or break it for me if the camera controls aren't good. Super Mario 64’s camera controls give me nightmares. But Frontiers, not too shabby. And this is impressive considering how Sonic’s past camera controls usually sucked. Looking at you SA2 and Unleashed.Another pro is the boss battles. They’re more flashy over being hard but tbh I don’t mind this at all. I don’t mind when a boss can make you feel cool over a tough as nails boss and Super Sonic being included in all battles helps with making you feel super cooooool. At least as cool as you can be sitting on your couch with the laptop on your lap and holding an Xbox 360 controller. I’m so coolAnd that’s all the pros I can think of. Now onto the consThe ConsFirst thing first, while I like running around as Sonic, one problem I have is that it doesn’t feel like Sonic is equipped to run around in the world that he is placed in. He is constantly getting stuck over little things on the floor and it’s just annoying at times. Or how the collision can be a bit wonky, I’m talking full Sonic 06 at times. Another con is the momentum or lack there of itSonic fans have seemed to treat the word like it’s the plague but I feel like the lack of momentum was a huge missed opportunity on Sonic Team. Sonic basically controls like other platforms, has the normal yet slow speed and then has a run button. Yes, a Sonic game has a run button. And Ik that Lost World had it too but Lost World felt like that style warranted the button since the game was literally trying to copy Mario Galaxy. And another reason why Lost World’s use of it is better than Frontiers is the fact that Lost World’s run button doesn’t run out. The boost button being able to run out only really worked in the Boost games since that didn’t automatically fill up, u needed to do stuff like kill enemies to increase it. But here the button having a limit just makes it annoying especially since Sonic goes really slow when he isn’t using boost. And Ik that the leveling up system increases his speed but it’s still kinda lame. And the thing is that it could have worked. Sonic Speed Simulator on fricken Roblox has momentum and a leveling up system and while I agree that both systems are grindy at least Speed Simulator automatically increases u speed after each level instead of forcing you to run around and find one of the elden rocks to level yourself up.Another con is how the game flip flops between telling you exactly what to do and leaving you with nothing. In a minigame you’re told exactly what to do while in a boss battle it doesn’t even give you a hint at what to do. How was I supposed to know that I was suppose to use parry on these bombs? I don’t want the game to hold my hand the entire way through but at least idk show the bomb having a little effect which shows that you can parry them. Or maybe after dying a few times it tells you “try parrying” or something simple like that. It’s especially annoying when it tells you to go somewhere and then it has it be across an entire island forcing you to backtrack and figure out which platforming challenge in the sky you need to get to so it can take you to that island.Though these are more minor complaints, my main complaint is the cyberspace levelsNow let me say this right here, I am not a fan of the boost gamesSo maybe I’m a bit biased but my god are these just not fun. They pulled these from Forces which were pulled from Generations and there is little that was changed to accommodate Sonic's new playstyle. Try boosting, 9 times out 10 you’ll accidentally boost yourself off a platform and fall off into your death. I think a perfect example is how during the part in Sky Sanctuary where u go up a crumbling tower Sonic is no joke not fast enough to go up it in time, forcing you to boost which isn’t bad. But it is bad if god forbid you jump once or you accidently didn’t boost the exact moment you got on forcing you to fall.And because there is no momentum it makes other stages like Chemical Plant annoying to play.I don’t care that it’s nostalgia pandering, I care if it’s a good/fun stage which these aren’tAnd the worst part is that these are your main forms of getting the chaos emeralds. You need to play these and complete the mini missions to get the keys. Sometimes you’ll get one after killing a boss but most of the time these are how you’re getting them. So I literally can’t avoid thesePlus if you’re going to force me to play these at least give me more unique type levels. Not Green Hill, Chemical Plant, Sky Sanctuary, and generic Mission Street. No joke these are the only levels you’ll ever see and man they make me really hate Green HillDoesn’t help that these have fixed cameras making it harder to tell where you’re going or where you are in conciliation to the ground. WhoopieThis is also where I learned that…. the game doesn’t have brief invisibility when you get, they kinda have it in the open world part but it’s super fast so we have a Sonic 1 problem. Fun And that’s my complaints My Final ThoughtsOverall Sonic Frontiers is a good game. I feel like this game is a great blueprint of where to take Sonic in the future. While I do have some problems with this game these can and should be fixed in future entries, cut Sonic Team some slack this is their first open world game after all. And I feel like the most important thing about a game is if it’s fun to play and if it can keep you coming back. And considering how I’ve played this game for about 10+ hours as of right now over the course of a few days, yeah I think it’s doing this job correctly",,

"this game has a fantastic story, and goes into great yet subtle detail with sonic and his own character when it comes to him masking his fears and pain, only allowing himself to collapse when nobody can see him. this, coupled with the soundtrack, makes for a game that i would wholeheartedly recommend. that being said it keeps crashing on me and it makes me want to rip my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hair out by the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ roots. thank you sega.",,

I'm curious about Chaos & his Relatives, I question myself, What was Chaos' Original Role before being inside the master emerald with Tikal, so many mysteries! I really can't wait to see what's next!

"IMPORTANT:
When the game starts, it asks about movement speed style. Those are actually OPTIONS in the game menu. If you go into options, you can adjust a lot of stuff related to Sonic's speed - so once you try out the action-style controls, go into the menu and tweak around.

I absolutely LOVED turning the 'Top Speed' option to MAX.

Just finished the game.
I am not that big on Sonic games, but I must admit that travelling this fast as Sonic.... well, they kinda nailed the speed. It's pretty majestic to boost around and cross the entire island in a matter of seconds, even though all I was doing was literally just running. It's pretty awesome.

The game has a bit of serious JANK at times and it gets quite annoying in the late game -> but weirdly enough it didn't really ruin my enjoyment.
Believe it or not - if they polished up the JANKY camera locks and some enemy encounters... this would turn out even better.

Also, would be cool if we had even more control of Sonic while boosting.
One thing I really wish was a thing - if I could press the Boost button to use Minimum Top Speed, but press another button to have the boost switch to MAX Top Speed. Switching your maximum Top Speed on the fly would've been majestic...

Also - one bad thing was that ""retry"" on the Stages took an extra button press. I wish Cyberspace worlds just allowed a quick-retry if I hit the ""select"" button... but that is a minor gripe.

Overall - I'd give it a solid 7/10.
The jank, the SIX TOWERS and the extra steps to select ""retry"" on Cyberspace stages brings it down.
But ultimately - believe it or not - it was a fun game.
I just wish they made a Sonic Frontiers 2 or something. This Open-World formula works exceptionally well for Sonic, really.... Just allow us to switch on the fly between 2 Top Speeds when boosting and you'd have quite a solid game next time.",,
"Before Updates 1-3: Really love the game! While it is not a perfect game by any means, it is definitely a step in the right direction for the series (in terms of main-line Sonic games).

Update 1: I loved the new additions it added to the game. The Jukebox could've used more song choices but I think its a nice addition and I wish it could be used on the new Ouranos Island in Update 3 which is later in my review here. Photo mode while not terrible, is completely janky and the limited amount of filters and not a lot of charm to it isn't really helpful, but I do get some great shots with it though so thats a positive. The Boss Rush is something that should've been in the base game, but I enjoy it a lot, even to this day! The Cyberspace Challenges is a nice addition but it's something that I don't go back to as much since the original Cyberspace levels are unoriginal (not all of them but a good chunk) and just not super fun because of the way Sonic controls in Cyber Space. Overall, a good update in my eyes but not perfect/

Update 2: This update was extremely fun and it brought the Spin Dash in the game as well which was such an amazing feature. You can get insane height with it and it made the experience a lot more enjoyable. The Koco platforming sections were nice as well, loved the call-backs with them like one of the Kocos having Caliburn from Black Knight was awesome. The birthday UI, while a neat feature, definitely has way too much going on in it. The birthday outfits are adorable and amazing on all the characters and Kocos. The new customization options like the Jump Deceleration was AMAZING. Thank you for adding this. While it doesn't work on all surface areas, its great in my opinion. Still the physics needs some work.

Update 3: I think Update 3 is good but not perfect at all. Amy controls similarly to Sonic in a way and I think she is just fine even if her combat should've had her hammer being used in more combat-oriented moves. Not a huge deal to me however. Knuckles being my least favorite character to play as which is super disappointing because I was looking forward to play as him. The start-up animation for gliding is really bad as well as the turning with gliding being awful. Tails is kind of in the same boat as Amy, although I don't like how Tails does not have a homing attack. The change of the ending actually made me get misty eyed which has never happened to me before in a video game in general (besides some music from previous Sonic games), the cyberspace stages that are new in this update show some really creative level-designs even if its still Green Hill, Chemical Plant, etc etc. and Sonics' controls in Cyberspace being super different than in the open zone. Also, THE POP-IN NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE NEXT GAME. It is much worse in Update 3 in my opinion and some animation glitches still occur and some new ones pop up as well like Sonic's right quick-step animation being busted... The difficulty spike also took me by surprise. The towers weren't super terrible for me but however, the Master Koco trial really took a toll on me because of the Perfect Parry not really being built for the Titan fights in mind.
-
However negatives aside, the OST is absolutely fantastic and I love the characterization in this game as well as the voice acting. Cutscene animations needs to be addressed as well in the next game. The future is definitely looking bright for the next main-line Sonic games, I just hope SEGA doesn't screw Sonic Team over again, and instead give them the proper budget, crew and time needed to make the best Sonic game since the Adventure titles/Classics/ whatever your favorite era of titles are.
-
Overall, I think this is definitely the best 3D Sonic game since Unleashed/Generations with the best story/characterization since Black Knight. It's truly a great time to be a Sonic fan and I'm glad that the team listened to feedback even if not all of it ended up getting into the game. There is always the next one! Thank you Kishimoto and the rest of the team for everything! This games' first two trailers brought me back into the franchise because of the serious tone it was going for and it being a ""open-zone"" Sonic game, definitely got me excited at the time.

Post update cycle:
This game is something I've continuously come back to just to run around the open zones (mostly Rhea Island since you have a lot more space even if its empty), I'm glad the team addressed the start-up animation and gliding on Knuckles and the Master King Kocos' Perfect Parry. However, the pop-in really needs to be ironed out with the next main-line Sonic game.",,
Sonic Frontiers is really fun on its own because I first played it on Xbox but with PC you can use a few mods to fix up the little things (something I recommend is Trackers physics tweaks) and the game is even more fun including Cyberspace!,,
"Sonic Frontiers macht viel Spaß und ich würde es vielleicht sogar als das beste Sonic Spiel einstufen.
Das Spiel habe ich zeitgleich mit dem neuen Hogwarts Spiel gekauft und bevorzuge das Sonic Spiel zu spielen und dabei bin ich nicht mal ein wirklicher Sonic Fan ;)

Im Spiel befinden sich viele Abwechslungsreiche Herausforderungen, die meistens optional sind. Es ist jedem Spieler bis zu einem gewissen Punkt selbst überlassen, wie viel dieser in der Open World machen möchte.
Das Kampfsystem ist toll und bietet viele Angriffsmöglichkeiten, die alle ihre Existenzberechtigungen haben. Es ist weder zu komplex noch zu einfach.
Sonic kann durch das erledigen von Aufgaben und entdecken der Welt Gegenstände einsammeln, die ihn permanent schneller, stärker, robuster oder seine Ringbörse größer machen.

Neben kämpfen gibt es auch nette Rätsel, die ins Gameplay passen. Keine Sorge, 85% der Zeit läuft man schnell durch die Gegend und löst Geschicklichkeitsaufgaben.
Es gibt auch klassische Strecken, die man für sich gekapselt spielen kann mit einzelnen Herausforderungen.
Mit dem Voranschreiten des Spielverlaufs steigt auch der Schwierigkeitsgrad nach und nach.

Auch die Geschichte im Spiel ist ganz nett.",,
"Pretty fun! And, with the exception of Sonic Mania, has the best music I've heard in a Sonic game. The respawning bosses are a pain, and the forced 2D parts can really get on your nerves after awhile, but overall this was a worthwhile experience in my opinion.",,

"Its a step in the right direction for the Sonic franchise. Hopefully SEGA keeps this momentum up and redeem the Sonic franchise from the previous misfires, especially making sure the games have time to get their stuff right.",,
"**Spoilers**

I don’t see any reason why not buying this game, it’s the best sonic game ever since generations or even adventure 2, based on both critics and fans reviews

Good game, Incredible soundtrack (I liked the combination of metal, electronic music, and sometimes in islands like the second one they used tablas and sitar), cyberspace was neat, story was fun, bosses are hell of fun,

But no sex?

Still 4.8/5, because of some minor stuff like: the pinball mini game, the third island’s 2d segments, the spaceship (idk the name of the game it’s inspired from but I think it’s also inspired by galaga) mini game.
But at the end of the day, but it especially on sale",,
"As someone who has been a longtime fan of Sonic since my childhood days, I am thoroughly impressed by the absolute, otherworldly setting that Sonic Frontiers establishes to set itself apart from previous 3D Sonic games. Having Sonic Colors Ultimate to have been the recent installation I have played, Sonic Frontiers' world feels like a breath of fresh air, and I would dare say that it shares similarities to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. While the two worlds are different in their own way, I do appreciate that the greenery of Kronos Island has both a melancholy vibe to it, as well as feeling very much alive in a mysterious way.

I'm currently 8 hours in at the very moment and I would like to state that I can feel the genuine speed of Sonic's movements in the world he is given free reign of to run from one side of Kronos Island to the other. While the speed is greatly slowed if you were to compare it to Sonic Unleashed and so forth, I can understand the necessity to slow Sonic down to some degree in order to truly appreciate the openness of said island, as well as the others that are to follow once you've gained access to them.",,
"The best Sonic game in a decade, game-changing for the series and opens so many possibilities for the future.
It sets the template for what will be an UNDEFEATABLE franchise like we deserve.

Update 3 closed us off in the best way possible, keeping the hype going for a year is something rarely felt in a single player game, can't wait for what's coming next!",,
"As much as it's obviously borrowing from BoTW and other open-world titles of that ilk, this game is just genuinely fun. The open world is loose and there's a bit of a learning curve to avoid pinwheeling off into the sea, but it feels fluid and satisfying to traverse, the combat is simple but variable enough to keep me engaged, the cyberspace levels are... there, if you're into speedrunning for S-ranks you might get something out of them, but personally I have no desire to replay them. It's definitely not a perfect game - the pop-in, some texture glitching, some really janky-looking cutscenes... but as far as playing it goes? This is the most fun I've had with the franchise since Mania, and I sincerely hope they push this concept further in the future because it has a lot of potential.",,
"Y'know, you wouldn't think an open-world sonic game would work. It very much so does. Here's the TLDR Break down

Controls 10/10
Combat is high pace and very fluid. The bosses have solid mechanics to figure out and are well incorporated into the open-world setting.

Graphics 10/10
It's better than I thought a sonic game would deliver. You can see the hairs on Sonic, and that's on the Steam deck. Also, it's compatible with the steam deck!

Story 8/10
The story is pretty good so far, and I am only 4 hours into the game ....but... You can accidentally skip major story cut scenes, as I have found out. If you don't go into the first instanced zone, you'll miss out on some cut scenes, so at least do each of your instanced zones at least once

I am thoroughly impressed by this game. I'd definitely give it an over all 9.5/ 10",,
"Wow Wow WoW! This game is amazing. Sonic games in modern time have been hit or miss and this one really landed for me. I enjoyed the story and am looking forward to 100% the game. I also cannot wait for the DLC (it's free, wow)! No ultrawide support is a bummer but, that was an easy fix. I also cannot believe how well this game ran considering how great it looks, I'm pretty sure I didn't have any stutter or framedrops BUT, the (I don't really know what to call it) ""Sonic rails and walls (y'know stuff that looks like it's from a Sonic game)"" do pop in at very close distances. This did not change regardless of if I put the game on a HDD or SSD.
I recommend the game and I think the quality of the game warrants a full price purchase... however I do wish it were a bit longer (one more island or so).",,
"Its not perfect, but it's much better than the previous few games. And besides, the soundtrack (especially the boss themes) are great.",,
First time I've genuinely felt happy about sonic in years.,,
"just finished the game, this game is one of the best sonic games ever made, even if you're not a fan of sonic you have to play this and for sonic fans its a must-play.. had great time with it
9/10",,
Gotta go fast!,,
BEST SONIC GAME IN A WHILEEEEEE LETS GO SEGAAAAAA,,
The game was really fun and had good platforming with some decent combat. The music is absolutely amazing and it surprised me with how good it was for the fights. Some complaints would be that the rendering distance and graphical settings are pretty low making pop-ins happen almost too close in the open world and some fights were not the most climactic or exciting. Overall I'd say the game is an 8/10 that does pretty well in most areas but with some areas lacking,,

+ Seagulls are as fast as Sonic

"What a game. As an off and on fan of the franchise, im actually pretty easy going on what Sonic ""is"" in terms of how it should play, i don't adhere to classics purism, or Adventure era or boost era formula's as ""how it should be"". Frontiers is what you liked about all of these, so a bit like Generations but less pandering and more of an attempt to experiment with an open ended level design and incorporating beat em up combat, which actually works incredibly well. Story is strong and makes the characters feel like they should rather than the obnxious self aware parody's they were in the 10's. It's not afraid to embrace the adventure era edge either which is just so fun.

All in all it's a fantastic game that i can't wait for the update DLC. Some people will rag on this game for small issues ""this game is so buggy!!! sonic always was bad"" sorta comments. Considering how buggy AAA games usually release in these days, frontiers is VERY polished with only a couple minor bugs, it also ran smoothly on my 6 year old hardware. The only things in the game I disliked were:
-Sonic's character is stiff and they don't do much with him except ""memba X event from old game?"" the reminiscening is fine but i feel like he should've been given back some more of his adventure era energy rather than how tired he sounds in this game.
-Main bug you'll encounter is occasionally homing attack especially in combat will freak out and send you to the wrong enemy or just an obstacle rather than the thing you wanted to attack. This can lead to deaths very frequently or just losing your combo which never feels good.
-Caterpillar and Sumo field boss fights are really bad and not fun at all. both have a degree of RNG that never feels fair. Caterpillar forces you to take it as slow as possible and Sumo will take a long time to beat if you miss even one bounce on his cage, and he sends out drones that bounce around. There's a bit more why than that but ill leave it brief.
-The ""Mechanic Collector"" minigame is buggy trash and the only other time i encountered a bug in the game. Be prepared for frustration.

It ain't perfect, and just saying that some people will say haha you admit its mediocre! No, its not, its actually really damn good and i had fun my entire 30 hours playing, its got a lot less bugs and gameplay problems than most AAA games have in the past few years, and one of the few open world games that are actually fun all the way through and not just busy work, the only other being Elden Ring.",,

"I'll recommend it but it's probably the most lukewarm rec I've ever given. The world is cooler than I thought it would be and it is fun to run around and go through some of the ""obstacle course"" set pieces. The combat unfortunately is rather repetitive, the controls as a whole have moments of extreme frustration and weirdness, and some of the dialogue is pretty cringe. But overall it's a nice vibe and low intensity time killer.",,
"Imagine a school child who has been bringing home only Ds and Fs for years. By now you've lost hope - you're like, ""Yeah well, if need be, they can always work at Wendy's"".
But suddenly, one day, they bring home a B-. You look at the results and realize: Some things they copied from Wikipedia, some things look sloppy, and some things you're sure they copied from the smart person sitting next to them, because no way in hell is your child THAT smart. Also there are a bunch of typos and grammar errors everywhere. But in any case - there is reason for hope again. This is basically Sonic Frontiers in a nutshell.",,
"Won't go into too much detail for this one, but you should give this game a go!! They fixed the writing for the characters and the soundtrack is amazing as well! Despite some bugs here and there, I was able to 100% on my first playthrough of Sonic Frontiers.

I recommend picking it up when it's on sale. o:",,
finally a good sonic game,,
It alright. Honestly it's more fun with mods that enhance the controls.,,
I had fun but it became a bit of a grind near the end,,
Best sonic game i have ever played. It's like a mixture of the adventure games and boost games and is one of the best sonic has felt since adventure 1,,

hedgehog run real fast,,
"really fun story, game play is good but very repetitive after a while and feels like it is mainly their to just pad out the run time versus meaningful game play. Frontiers is at its best when not taken super seriously and played only for fun.",,
"i have got all the achievements on ps5 and on pc, this game is a huge stepup from the last decade of games, the last good 3d sonic game before this was gens or debatable lost world for me, theres so much that i love about this game but there quite abit of negatives like cyberspace, i like cyberspace i find it fun af to speedrun the stages using the homing dash but this doesn't make it ok for the rehash of level themes, level design and the bad control, the game starts to go down in quality in chaos island by the constant use of 2d which gets rlly annoying when you play it, spoiler warning from here onwards, riea island (idk how to spell it sorry) is a beautiful island but turns into my least fav island due to it being only a story event which is disappointing because the island would of been my fav if it was a normal island, the final island is just a bigger kronos with inflation so i like to call it inflation island (reminds me of england rn) it takes alot of collecting to get the island finished unless you do what i like to do fishing, fishing is actually kinda fun this game its just a quick qte's and easy rewards, the ending of this game yet again is disappointing, supreme being a giganto clone and being a boring fight left a sour taste in my mouth, and the final boss the end was so anti climatic, sonic not reacting to sages death did not feel like smth sonic would do i think he would of cared and checked on eggman but unfortunately we didnt get to see that, after all this ranting it makes it seem i hate the game when its quite the opposite i love this game alot i have played it 7 times now 6 times on ps5 and once so far playing the game modded, the best part of this game is definitely the first 3 titan bosses, they all have amazing songs to go with them and the fights themselves are 10/10s, the ost is rlly good too thats all i have to say on the ost go listen to it,
i rlly reccomend this game despite the game clearly needing more time to cook the foundations here can make the next sonic game even better, buy it on a sale

Sonic is finally fast,,
"Looking past some missteps and questionable designs (like the game flipping a coin on whether or not Sonic moves with momentum or is stuck onto the ground, and having to level up some of the stats one at a time) this is genuinely a fun game to play and could very well be a new chapter of Sonic games if SEGA and the developers continue to embrace this sort of tone and direction. Sonic's world got far too bloated and far too goofy by the end of Forces and a reset to the core cast (plus Sage who has rapidly gone up my list of favorite Sonic characters) was more than necessary to tell the more focused story that Ian wanted, told in the serious sincerity that early 3D Sonic games excelled at.

Ian Flynn and Roger Craig Smith are the standout stars for this game as Ian writes a competent story (well, competent for Sonic game standards - Ian doesn't meet the usual highs he reaches in the IDW comics) and Roger delivers a soft-spoken tone we rarely see in the blue hedgehog. Crush 40 will always be the king of Sonic buttrock but Kellin Quinn's vocals for the boss tracks are taking shots at the throne. The Cyberspace tracks vary in quality, but are all good (not nearly as memorable).

I'm looking forward to the extra story content.",,
"Killer soundtrack, stunning graphics and I can see sonic team actually trying something new and interesting with this title. Go play it",,
Fun combat system with a good mix of classic sonic gameplay with new free roaming mechanic thats makes the repetitive grinding not all that repetitive,,
one of the funnest games I've played. Highly recommend it.,,
Yes,,
"A very fun Sonic game as someone who LOVED and replayed Sonic Adventure 2 Battle countless times over. The world is charming, the characters are fantastic, and it's fun to stumble across Kocos in the overworld! Of course, the soundtrack is great as always.

The two negatives for me are that something just feels... off in the way Sonic controls in cyberspace. He's more slippery than in the overworld maybe? Also, having Elder Koco level your stats one at a time can take very long.

Overall a great game and I look forward to the content coming out in 2023!",,
"I know it's not saying that much but it is one of the best Sonics game to come out in a long time.

What I like about it is you can just kind of zone out and play without thinking too hard or paying too much attentions. it's the perfect watch tv and while playing a game, game. There are 100s of mini puzzles and challenges scattered around the map. They take anywhere from a couple of seconds to a minute to complete. Its fun and you satisfy the urge to collect and complete.",,
"Fun, Fast, and surprisingly challenging for a Sonic game. Sonic Frontiers is worth the buy, even though it is rough around the edges. It is by no means perfect, but it still stays being fun the whole way through",,

drippy game all the haters are goofy ahh,,
"Best 3D Sonic game! Great game play, awesome music, charismatic characters and fun challenges. Is what a video game is supposed to be which is been forgotten lately. This is a game for Sonic fans and people that love Video Games.",,
"Finally, a good 3D Sonic game. Haven't really had one since the GameCube days. It has some issues but please, keep going in this direction, for the love of all that is holy.

More of the 3D open exploration and less of the 2D atrocious physics and controls, please. Sonic Unleashed was a mistake and we're still suffering through it, even in this game.

Edit for the Final Horizon update: this is now one of the best games in the whole series. The level design in the new story is a massive improvement over the base game (there are no 2D sections AT ALL!!) and the movesets for Amy, Knuckles and Tails are amazing. The new final boss is great. I couldn't have asked for more.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is by far the best game in the series that has released in a long time. It has a satisfying game loop, and an intriguing story, as well as a killer soundtrack. Some areas could be a bit repetitive, but overall was a fun time. I rate it 7 Chaos emeralds.",,
better than genshin,,
I've played Sonic since I was 9 years old. And this is a good game.,,
honestly best game,,
sonic is hoter than jesus,,
"It's the best we've seen Sonic in YEARS. after the many many games Sega has released in the past about our favourite blue hedgehog they finally did something right. the open world is fun to explore and the game rewards you with exploring with items you need to become faster and stronger. Sonic Frontiers is one helluva game and Sega isn't done yet, more content coming free to all who own the game and I can't wait",,

"A good Sonic title, but the Sonic Adventure games are better in my opinion. I enjoyed it, but would rather have seen them actually make Sonic Adventure 3 instead. I guess Sonic Adventure and Half-Life have something in common; they can't count to 3.

Pros:
Good soundtrack
Boss fights are great
Missions to unlock keys is fun as they feel more familiar to the sonic franchise
Mini boss fights for Portal Gears in open world can be a fun diversion.

Cons:
Open gameplay on islands filled with boring challenges. Sidestep to glowing panels, kick ball through hoop, etc. Challenges children wouldn't struggle with, but gets repetitive.
Occasional starting a rail grind, wall climb, etc. while heading to an objective puts the camera into 3d side-scrolling mode and forces you to stop everything you're doing and play along.
Story feels kinda short, especially compared to Sonic Adventure 2 Battle",,
"Liked: Controls are solid, enemies/environments have good variety, the music is enjoyable, and the boss fights are epic. Would definitely recommend for Sonic fans especially if you prefer more open-world Sonic games. This game also has a great modding community!

Disliked: The game is too easy (even on ""Hard"" mode), and the draw distance is visibly limited.

Neutral: The story is pretty standard (with some fun callbacks to previous titles), the Cyberspace stages can range from fun to frustrating, and the progression system seems a little limited (unlocked everything at the halfway point of the story).

Definitely recommend for Sonic fans! Non-fans might want to wait for a price drop.",,
"Man, this game, it's pretty fantastic. I'm just gonna get the negatives out of the way. The third act definitely feels rushed, the difficulty isn't very high, and Cyberspace controls are just weird. Aside from that, I loved the crap out of this game, definitely the best Sonic has been for YEARS. The boss fights alone are worth playing this game for. Bottom line, it has problems, but you'll have a great time with Sonic Frontiers!",,
"OK im going to give my Pros and Cons about this game
-Cons-
1. Wall Running feels inconsistent and sometimes the controls on a keyboard and mouse feels unresponsive
2. Minor glitches from fighting enemies in the world (for example I locked on a target and they flew off the map and I went with it)
3. The final boss is meh, not terrible but has less impact then other Sonic bosses

-Pros-
1. OMG THE MUSIC. I have heard of Kellin Quinn before but now I go out of my way to find her work. Incredible.
2. Even though the final boss is lacking. Giganto, Wyvern, and Knight are possibly one of the most hype bosses ive ever fought in gaming history. I also love how you can sync the song to the fights, amazing touch.
3. Open world sonic games in my opinion should be the main focus going forward. I consider myself a Sonic mark and a old school fan, the 2d era was enjoyable and different. 3D era is where I became a true fan and open world games sometimes feel fake, this one does feel fake, you have to interact with the world in order to continue in the world
4. I was gonna put this on the cons but I am glad Sonic team acknowledge's Tails being a coward, or Knuckles being a clueless muscle jock. I have my hopes for the next game or DLC they change in a way that will impact there characters in a big way.
5. Sonic Unleashed is my favorite sonic game but what sonic unleashed did for me is get me invested into the lore of sonic, Frontiers has me invested again into the lore.
6. Hands down possibly the best Super Sonic fights, better then Adventures, Unleashed, even generations.",,

game is gud yes,,
Okay I got this game not expecting to play it alot. But it is definitely worth the purchase. You can fish in the game. That is all i will add,,
"Overall a fun experience. Running around the world as sonic feels pretty good, story ain't half bad either (expect that little dance sonic makes when he gets chaos emeralds). Admittedly the game could've been so much more, mainly on the platforming side. One huge issue i have with this one are 2D sections, they feel slow and clunky, especially in cyber space levels, definitely worse than generations and even forces. I feel like it's time for modern games to scrap up 2D entirely. I would recommend it, although wait for sale, don't think it's worth full 60 bucks.",,
"Speaking as a long term Sonic fan, this is easily the best game we have had in years! But, the game is simply a good game. Its nothing ground breaking or top of the charts but for the 1st time in a long time we have a fun, replayable Sonic game. I think they need to just keep with this formula and expand upon it moving forward. Different environments, a more in depth skill tree and movement mechanics, more characters of course, and a chao garden but thats never going to happen sadly. For a Sonic game this is a 14/10 as a regular game......i'd say about a 6 or 7. Fun to be had but needed some tweeks and time needed.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is a step in the right direction. This game is a near-perfect foundation of story structure, characters, settings and harmonics that each game in the future should work and improve on.

This was the first game in the series since Mania that I actually enjoyed. The first 3D Sonic game I've enjoyed since Generations. Forces was an absolute clusterfunk of ""what"". This game was a complete 180. I enjoyed every minute I played, I enjoyed the new formula they were playing with.

Looking forward to the updates coming in 2023! Hopefully this makes the game worth it even more than it is! P.S: Kellin Quinn doing the vocals for the first 3 titans absolutely made my days, I love Sleeping With Sirens.

Update edit: This game HAS reached peak. So much new content and its more than some bonuses! Island challenges, New Game+, Extreme Mode, Battle/Cyberspace rush modes, collectables, QoL fixes, as well as the legendary Final Horizon update adding a whole new alternate final island to the game! I loved this new ending. I absolutely screamed my heart out with the final boss, the , and the new Super Sonic forms! This has become my new favourite sonic game of all time, despite the few issues the final update might have with balancing.",,
"It's the Sonic game I waited 5 years for and the wait was worth it. For Sonic Team's first attempt at a game like this, they did pretty damn good making a foundation that mostly everyone can get behind and support. Now I'm waiting to see what feed back and ideas that can be implemented in the next title that can seriously go beyond anything they've done before for the blue blur. Until, Cheers to 2022 being Sonic's year!",,

"Between this, the second movie, the Netflix series, and... at least the animations for Origins, Sonic the Hedgehog fans ate well in 2022.

I will admit that I was skeptical when I first heard it's following the open-world trend. Like, if SEGA somehow can't even get linear levels right anymore, how was a fully explorable world supposed to work? My hopes went up as I saw it wasn't going to be bargain bin price right off the bat, then went down with a bad gameplay trailer, and then back up again once a better one came out a few days later on Nintendo's YouTube channel of all places.

My point is, the anticipation for this game was quite the ride.

But, let's get down to brass tacks: I loved this game.

Is it perfect? No. There's a bit of a lack of polish here and there probably due to getting this out for the holiday season, but this is the best Sonic game we've seen in a long time, and not just by Sonic standards. I'm debating whether or not this dethrones my previous favorite entry in the series.

The open-world is where this game shines the most. Running around freely as Sonic feels very satisfying. The controls are surprisingly tight; I think this may be the best control over Sonic and gives the player the best feel for what it would be like to be Sonic than any of the games have ever had. Regaining control after missing a jump or running the wrong way was almost always easy. I did find myself shot off a cliff either due to weird physics or missed rail detection, but even then I often was able to steer myself around and make my way back onto land. Combat is pretty fun, and there are plenty of enemies and moves to learn to make each fight feel different. Admittedly, the RPG elements are a grind. You have to collect items to boost Sonic's power, defense, speed, and ring capacity, and upgrading those latter two takes forever due to the nature of boosting them.

The cyberspace Zones are... okay. Apparently some people don't like them at all, and they are definitely the weakest part of the game, but I don't think there are any I truly hated. If I had a rough time with one, I often found myself picking up the rhythm after finishing it once. Unfortunately, each of the zones are only based off of four previous levels in Sonic history: ""Green Hill"" (because of course ""Green Hill"" is here), ""Chemical Plant,"" ""Sky Sanctuary,"" and ""City Escape,"" so the look of each level does get samey. Thankfully, each zone has its own song and gimmick, so it never gets too repetitive. Unfortunately, S Ranks are now only based on time, and hitting enemies actually slows you down, so to get said rank, your best bet is to ignore them altogether. It feels wrong. Not that any are hard to get. Well, except for level. You'll know it when you see it.

The boss fights are amazing and satisfying. I don't want to give these away. Go into them blind if you can.

The music isn't quite what you'd expect from the series, but I don't think there are any songs I would truly call bad, just different. There weren't any I didn't at least enjoy to an extent.

Finally, the plot and characters are much better than we've been getting. It feels more like the era in terms of story, and the dialogue was written by Ian Flynn from the comic series. Characters are actually acting like themselves again; Amy is the heart of the group (without being summarized as ""likes Sonic""), Tails's techno-babble nonsense has been replaced with a more advanced vocabulary (AKA: actual words), Knuckles feels like he has a rivalry with Sonic again (something Shadow seems to have taken away since he was introduced in ), and Sonic isn't spouting cringey, undeserved one-liners every time he opens his mouth.

Overall, is one of the best experiences with the series I've had in a long time. If you're on the fence or don't like paying full price for a short game, maybe wait for it to go on sale, but you're doing yourself a disservice if you sleep on this one.",,
"I had a pretty good time with Frontiers but there are definitely some things that drag it down. I would recommend the game but not at full price.

The pop in really is as bad as people say and screws with the amount of reaction time you have when approaching objects. The 2D perspective stuff is still annoying and still here, I wish they would quit forcing it into the 3D platformers. It would've been a lot cooler to see the stuff you interact with be more organic than being composed entirely of Ancient technology, maybe like leaf platforms or vine rails. This has been done before in SA2 and Heroes so it definitely could've been used here to keep the world feeling alive. Environmental collision is not smooth enough and will frequently send you flying from tapping a small rock.

Cyberspace levels are pretty interesting to play with the new control style, typically the Adventure ones more than anything. A lot of the Generations/Unleashed stuff really doesn't feel right and was kinda just alright. The level with the drifting gimmick was particularly terrible but most of the others are pretty decent. Quickstep feels broken in a lot of these stages.

Combat and simply running around was a lot more enjoyable than I expected it to be. It could still be improved to be a lot snappier and more responsive but it works. I loved how the devs weren't afraid to utilize the entire controller in this game. It was unexpected that the settings would take inspiration from the Speed Simulator by allowing speed to be customized, but it's a really nice addition. I still wish there was a way to spindash by crouching then boosting.

Animation quality is decent but it's lacking compared to what we've already seen in previous games, namely Unleashed. Characters in the cutscenes are usually standing around talking and even then their lipsync doesn't always match up.

Music is great besides some of the Cyberspace themes that teetered into dubstep Minecraft YouTuber intros for some reason. The boss themes are a particular highlight. There is no Crush 40 in this game however which hurts my soul.

The boss fights are a spectacle but they're pretty lacking in actual substance and have to hold you back from beating them too quickly, which is very annoying. Just let me flex on the boss and go listen to the music later without being forced to wait for a scripted event to happen. Supreme got bugged while I was fighting it and I had to wait 5 minutes for the QTE to actually trigger. I seriously thought the game had locked up and a save would have to be loaded. The End sucks not only because it's not the core gameplay but also because you have to listen to the exact same stupid monologue if you die. All I could think of during this fight is how Rush Adventure did it better 15 years ago and that wasn't even a mainline title.

The stat system seemed to handle the attack and defense levels pretty good but upgrading speed or ring count takes entirely too long. I saved Kocos to level rings from 1 to 99 and it legitimately took around 25 minutes because the game has a weird delay before you can choose to do it again. This seems like something that could be fixed with a patch and hopefully will be in a later update.

The story didn't interest me very much until I noticed they are seemingly trying to establish a continuity going forward. I get it that they've been trying to go back to basics with these characters but it's a big missed opportunity to not allow experimenting with them in the open world. Yes, I am aware that a future update will add the main cast as playable characters but it's a shame we didn't get that on launch. It's a sidenote but I'm really hoping we can eventually get a story involving Team Dark with this level of care put into it.

Progression is absolutely perfect by allowing you to do what you want while still being able to further the story. If you gather enough purple coins, you can go fishing on almost every new island to get the emerald vault keys. The exception is one island only existing for a plot dump event.

Frontiers felt really refreshing to this series and didn't really drag for the 22 hours I played of it. We can only hope the next game will be a masterpiece that refines what was established here.",,
More games should consider just allowing you to fish to skip the rest of the game once it starts getting boring.,,
"yknow, I read all the reviews complaining about the controls and I gotta say: think that's a skill issue boss
edit: played through the entire game on hard, little to no issues. this game is absolutely, positively incredible, and one of my favorite sonic games to date. don't listen to the """"""""journalists"""""""" or """"""""critics"""""""", they've been ragging on the franchise for easy clicks for a long time now. don't screw yourself out of a good experience cause a contrarian wants to mouth off.",,
"In all honesty this is probably one of my favourite Nintendo games out there. I really feel like Sakurai honed in on Sonics image and overall gameplay, the nostalgia hit hard with this one. I was sad to hear that Luigi would no longer be a reoccurring character within the franchise, but all in all can't be too disappointed. We all know what happened on that fated day, April 17th 2022. I'd give it a solid 7/10, if you're looking for the more souls-like gameplay that you're used to from this series, I'm afraid this isn't the game for you",,
Good game and incredible soundtrack,,
One of the best 3d sonic games!!,,
10/10 would sex again,,
"Very fun, strait forward, What a Super sonic Blast",,
that was awesome,,
"In 29 hours, I 100% the game. All I can say is ""Wow! this was an amazing game."" Being able to run around freely as sonic feels amazing because of the great open zones, and because the controls are the best in the series yet( for me). The cyberspace levels are probably the games weakest point. They're too easy, and have different controls than the open zone, but the cyberspace levels aren't even required. (Still I S ranked all the levels like the chad I am.) The boss fights where great, and by far the best part of the game. I would highly recommend this game to die-hard sonic fans, and new fans trying to see what the blue blur is all about.",,
"Overall Score: 6.5/10 A fun, but incoherent mess that needs more time in the oven. Not worth the 60$ price tag or even the 40$ sale in its current state.

This was a unique sonic experience from the start to the end. I won't get too much into the story as this is mostly focused on the gameplay itself.

* Movement - Clunky and Unpolished
(Disclaimer. I played this with a mouse + keyboard so I can't tell how it feels to play with a controller)
In some parts of the game your movement will feel buttery smooth and amazing and in other parts it will feel like you're playing a souls-like with your feet while blindfolded, let me explain. Usually when your movement is restricted you can enter a flow-like state in parkour areas where sonic feels amazing to control and it's all around a fun experience, the problems come in when you get the constant switching between 2D and 3D or 3D restricted movement and 3D non-restricted movement. The changes happen suddenly and whenever there's not a clear sign that it's gonna occur it can lead to frustration.

Turning sonic while jumping is close to impossible without dashing and if you jumped a little bit too far and want to turn around to fix it, too bad. There are 2 ways to dash in this game, with Z to follow coins or with Shift for a general dash. In some parts of the game where you feel like you should use Z dashing to follow coins it can often just lead you to parts where you suddenly fall off the edge and if you're just slightly off having the perfect angle you sometimes follow the coins in the wrong direction instead, the pathfinding needs to be worked on. Normal dashing makes you fly very very far. This is good when you wanna get to places far away, but often I found myself in situations where I thought a dash would do the trick, but it ended up being too far and I had to re-do the entire section.

* Combat (Sonic) - Simple, but fun to watch
The game basically plays itself, most fights are usually just pressing the same buttons every encounter, but with cool animations to watch. I found myself switching my attacks often, not because I had to, but because I didn't wanna see the same cutscene play out over and over again. I thought the skill tree would be an interesting part of the game, but it got maxed out pretty quickly and there was not really any sense of accomplishment when getting a new attack. They even have an auto combo feature which I turned off in the options as I wanted some sort of action in the game. And last but not least, parrying is way too overpowered. Why do I just need to hold down two buttons to become completely immune basically every attack in the entire game from any direction and I don't even need to time the release or anything. If you're fighting something and don't know what to do, just use parry and it will probably do something favorable most of the time.

* Combat (Bosses) - Chef's kiss
I did not expect the bosses to be this good. Every overworld has a select few bosses that each have their unique way of taking them down and even though some of them are repeated, most of the time it's just fun. Squid games and Foretress are probably my favorite overworld bosses as they just look pleasing and feel great to take on. The main story bosses are a mixed bag, some parts of them are amazing while other parts just leave you confused as to what is going on.

* Overworld - Aestethically pleasing with eyesores sprinkled everywhere
The overworld design as a base is nice and vibrant. It's not amazing, but it's pleasing to look at and fun to run around in. The ruins and otherworldly technology fits like a nice glove and is fun to explore. But then you have the eyesores. Now I know that the rails, springs, floating platforms, ziplines, treadmills and random crates have a purpose of being parkour sections, but that doesn't make them any nicer to look at. It doesn't feel like any of it was meant to be there and if you take a step back it all just looks like a jumbled mess, not to mention that they also have vertical culling applied to them, so sometimes when you're falling down after a parkour section that took you high up in the air, suddenly a rail pops up out of nowhere. Gameplay wise it's nice to use for travelling or just to have some momentarily fun parkour, but design wise it's awful.


* Cyber Space Zones - Awful doesn't begin to describe it
On paper it sounds like a good idea. Classic sonic level designs where you go through a level as fast as possible and with multiple different routes to pick from, nice!

No... just no...

Overall these cyber space zones gave me a massive headache, Depth perception issues, restricted to non-restricted movement, Sonic randomly stopping, turning left or right in 3D is close to impossible, dashing off the stage because it's very sensitive, Z dashing into coins don't work after jumping off from rails, some parts that look like they intended for Z dashing are actually not, dashes don't reset when jumping to enemies so often you fall down thinking you had the dash still, locked camera angles, losing all coins when you die even if you respawn at a checkpoint where you had coins before that point on the stage, some stages require close to perfection with the times while others just require you to walk towards the goal at a moderate pace and much much more...

2D Cyber spaces: These are the most tame ones as they restrict your movement and a few of them are well designed and fun to play through. The parts I dislike about these are that sometimes it goes from you just cruising along to a precise platformer when you least expect it.

3D Cyber spaces: Oh boy, the worst part about the game. You fall off the stage constantly, depth perception leads you to miss targets you thought you'd hit with a dash, why aren't linear parts that are clearly split into 3 sections actually split into 3 sections so you can quickly switch between them. The only way to properly control sonic in these 3D stages is to completely ruin all your momentum and make sure you perfectly line yourself up cause if you're just slightly wrong in what angle you're looking at you can fall off the stage so easily. Whenever I found a cyber space portal I prayed to all that was holy that it wasn't a 3D one, they don't work when you're running fast, there's no clear level design and if you want to experience what a 3D cyber space has in terms of potential, go play Neon White. I got frustrated to no ends with these cyber spaces and it left a sour taste every single time to the point where I hated it whenever I found a portal.


* In conclusion: If you can stomach the price, poor movement in certain sections and cyber spaces. Go for it, this game is in its core fun to play. If you can't do that, then don't. This game feels like it's lost, it's attempting multiple different things yet masters none. It left me feeling mildly annoyed and I naively thought it would get better, but it just stayed the same throughout the whole thing. But you know what, the game has fishing and the soundtrack has some bangers. So it's not all that bad I suppose!",,

"Sonic Frontiers is a definitely a video game and its most certainly a game I have played. Now you get to witness my crappy review of this video game because I’m too obsessed with this dumb blue hedgehog. But if you don’t care to read this entire thing, I’ll just give you the tldr. I really like this game and I think it’s really fun. It’s not perfect but I think it does some nice things and I’m really excited for the future of this series.

Graphics:
The graphics for this game are beautiful. Everything looks so nice and detailed along with the menus and interface looking really clean and simple to use. Do I think it’s the best-looking Sonic game? I don’t know. I still prefer the look of Sonic Unleased more and I feel that game did a better job mixing cartoon and realism while in this game the areas are much more hyper realistic. With this style I feel that Sonic looks somewhat out of place when exploring the islands. The cyberspace stages however, retain that Sonic aesthetic we are used to and they look super cool. Even though they reuse the Green Hill, Sky Sanctuary, and Chemical Plant themes they still look awesome. I do wish that they used more original themes as I am getting sick of the same stage themes being reused over and over again.

Soundtrack:
It’s a Sonic game. They never miss with the soundtrack. Undefeatable GOATED. Nuff said.

Story (Spoilers???):
The story for this game isn’t anything grounding breaking but for a Sonic game I thought it was good. The stories for Sonic games aren’t masterpieces in storytelling so I wasn’t expecting anything to wow me but I was hoping for something more interesting compared to what we had in previous games. I think this story delivered on that. Learning more about the Chaos Emeralds and the Ancients was really interesting and makes the overall Sonic lore more expansive and engaging. I especially like how Sega is trying to make the series lore more connected and is using this game as a staring point by referencing a lot of past events the characters went through while also trying to expand on it with the new lore and character interactions as well. They even mention characters like which now means they are canon in the mainline series. It does make me wonder if Sega will go even further and get characters from other Sonic shows and series like Sonic X. I think it would be really cool if we had a game based on the Metarex Saga from Sonic X (PLAYABLE DARK SONIC PLEASE!!!!). Who knows but it's pretty exciting to see where the story for future games will go next. The interactions between the characters in this game were also pretty good as well. I especially like the one between Sonic and Tails. I really liked seeing this as it felt like Tails is going to have the chance to become a much better character in future games and I’m honestly excited to see how he develops. I don’t think this game has the best story in the series, but I appreciate the things that it does and I feel like it’s a small step to make the Sonic universe more connected and expansive. Thank the GOAT Ian Flynn for writing this story and I hope he and others that are more knowledgeable about this series can help write and contribute to the stories of future games.

Alright all that other stuff I mentioned don’t even matter. It’s time to talk about how this game actually plays. So what do I think of this game??? I think it’s pretty fun. Starting with the controls, Sonic actually controls pretty well. Sonic moves and turns quickly and smoothly. Sonic also comes with a lot of movement options as well like the homing attack, quick step, dodge, double jump, air boost, and drop dash. With all of these options it’s very easy to get where you wanna go around the world. I also love that you can also easily change the controls in the options if you don’t like them. Sonic too slow? Increase the top speed. Sonic turning way too fast? Lower the turning speed. It’s really awesome that this game gives you the option to perfect the controls to however you like to give the player the best experience (Sega really just said “Oh you think know how Sonic should play? Fine do it yourself ♥♥♥♥♥.”). But all that stuff I mentioned was for the overworld. How does Cyberspace control? It controls fine enough. Compared to something like Generations the overall gameplay for Cyberspace doesn’t feel as good but it’s not all bad either. Sonic still has more movement options in this game than in Generations so you can still have some fun moving around in these stages. I would probably compare the two games like this… In Generations Sonic controls like a racecar. Very fast but harder to control. In Frontiers he controls more like a fast bike. Slower but easier to control and do tricks with. In my opinion the gameplay in Generations feels more exhilarating but the gameplay in Frontiers isn’t a bad alternative either. Now let’s talk about the level design for the Cyberspace stages. So a lot of the levels reuse layouts featured in other games. This is honestly a bit lazy but it’s not a 1:1 translation. Only the STRONGEST of Sonic fans will truly notice but if you are a Sonic causal or newbie then you probably won’t care too much. The level designs they took are the good ones and they play great in this game too. I would still prefer if this game had its own completely original stages but I hope that Sonic Team uses this as an opportunity to learn how to design good stages for the next game. Let’s go back to the overworld and discuss a bit more about that. So in this game we have 5 islands each with a different theme. But really there are only 3 with the last two islands technically being a part of the first island. I don’t really have a problem with the last two islands but seeing the same grass theme again was pretty boring and it feels somewhat misleading to think that this game would have 5 unique islands. The last two islands are pretty much the endgame islands though so they are a bit more challenging in terms of platforming and enemies you have to fight so they are still enjoyable. Just disappointing. Each island has its own challenges and obstacles you can play with to unlock the map and get memory tokens. The challenges aren’t anything special, but some can be fun and they can be completed quickly. This game also features an actual combat system. The combat in this game is really fun. Its very simple but you still can unlock a lot of different moves to beat enemies in flashy ways so you never really get bored with it. I would love to see this combat be expanded upon in a future game. Lastly, I’ll quickly mention the boss fights. The boss fights are honestly the best part of this game are most certainly the best boss fights in the series. Super Sonic is so flashy and cool and you feel extremely powerful when fighting the bosses. It's just so hype.

Sonic Frontiers isn’t the best game to exist, but I do like it. I’m glad that Sega and Sonic Team have come up with a game that me and a lot of other fans are enjoying. I think if they take the time to improve on the positives of this game and expand on them while fixing some of the issues, we could have a really nice Sonic game in the future. In conclusion, Genshin Impact bad (For legal reasons this is a joke).",,

"One of the best sonic games to come out in a very long time. At times it can be a bit slow and dull, but when its good its GOOD, and can stay consistent with its quality. Game is fire, worth the money.",,
"gotta go fast.

the game does have a lot of problems with jank and weird slowness in menus which i hope they will patch out. But overall it is a really fun game, really what the sonic franchise needed. Running around in the open world collecting things is a blast. The titan enemies are unique and while it does get repetitive it never forces you to fight them so after a few times you can just ignore them. This game also has classic levels which are re-hashes of previous levels in older games but it was still fun.

Game's not winning any awards but really fun time. W for Sonic fans",,
"I wanna start out by saying i did really like this game i'm just gonna be critical about it because i think the fact that a sonic game is good for once is hiding some of the problems lol

I don't dislike this game being open world (its fun and nice zooming around the islands) but i think it was implemented kinda poorly. The island to level ratio is really bad, you spend 90% of the time on the island then when you do play a level they're about 2 minutes long. They feel like an afterthought and i feel like it might even be possible to beat this game without ever playing any of them? You can buy all the stuff you need from fishing and it's true at least for the last island that you can finish the game without doing a single level. I beat the game by accident without doing all the levels lol. You only need to play a couple to get all the achievements too, they're barely represented here so there's not much point trying to get S rank or whatever
Similarly, there's not a great need to fight the bosses. I didn't really beat many of them and even if you don't wanna buy all your gears from fishing you can just fight the same easy boss a couple of times instead of putting time and effort into beating them all. Idk i guess that part of it was pretty confusing to me i kept walking past bosses and not really understanding the point of them

Moving around the islands could be a pain at times. Floating separated islands could be really frustrating to get to, and often i'd unintentionally step on a boost pad and it'd take complete control of sonic and put you somewhere you had no intention of going. Sometimes you'd accidentally get thrust into 2d platforming sections that you physically can't get out of. There's a lot of boosts and springs hidden in grass so this happened a lot. It's the same with like enemy or boss fights, sometimes you trigger them completely by accident, or an enemy/boss will fly near you and suddenly you can't save or open your map

The atmosphere on the islands in this game is really weird. It felt like i was playing Nier Automata lol
I want my sonic games to be high saturation and fun and colourful (like im literally playing as a blue hedgehog in shoes) but the islands were like gloomy and dystopian and depressing. Obviously it's to do with the story but i feel like it could have been done better idk. At least the levels had a fun sonic vibe

This is a minor grievance but oh my god levelling up at elder koco is so slow i hate it. This is a game about going fast pls im begging u

Overall i enjoyed it, it's a really fun game. I like the fishing a lot and the music is fun. I would have liked to see more of the other characters but you could do some really cute minigames with them which was nice. Sonic is really fun and the graphics are great. I would recommend this and i really think it holds up as both a sonic game and also a regular game lol. The combat is fun and simple, although there's barely any turning into a ball, i would have liked to do that more. It controls well and it's cool to zoom around when you have max rings. It's fun!",,
"As someone who lost so much faith in the Sonic series that I had not played Colors or any game past it after being underwhelmed by Sonic and the Black Knight, I had critiqued this game harshly when it was announced, as most of us did. Then my friend got it and streamed it on Discord. Neither of us are premium, our internet connection wasn't the best, my vision got spotty due to bit rate and it was one the best Sonic experiences I ever had. This game loves the series, its history, the characters, the players, the levels and your time. I got this game and completely 100% it in a little less than 21 hours over my vacation. As someone who never played boost formula Sonic, the main hedgehog controlled impeccably, and while Sonic jank still exists, it never felt intrusive and was used to my advantage a few times. The open world may seem intimidating but there are steps you can take the islands apart piece by piece, one step at a time. And the boss fights, each and every one would be the final boss of a different game, and the actual final boss is a very different challenge, but one I overcame to get my ending. Overall, an incredibly fulfilling experience, one of the best uses of my vacation, and restored my faith of being a Sonic fan. I cannot wait to see how they evolve from here.",,
"Honest to god I don't even know where to begin.

This might be one of the best sonic games ever for me, even taking over SA2. The world is full of activities to do and to discover (not like Goobisoft, more like Jak and Daxter).

The new combat is satisfying and impactful. It won't be DMC but considering it is Sonic Team's first attempt at a character action game, I say they've done a marvellous job with it. The story is surprisingly well told with for a sonic game. Its a little bit more mature but not like Shadow The Hedgehog levels of edge. It has many underlining themes that we could all attribute to our own lives but it remembers that it is a sonic game and there are plenty of laughs to be had throughout the journey.

I don't know how they've done it but SEGA and Sonic Team have managed to bring this lil guy back from being a laughing stock and is something to now be reckoned with.

This is a very well crafted video game, one that is sincere in making you have a wonderful ride but on the plus side, you can feel the dedication and love that was put into almost every aspect of this game.

I recommend this game to anyone.",,
Speed,,
it is very good,,
is good,,
Way too addicting,,
Best 3D Sonic game since Generations. Open world sonic works and plays so well. Don't even get me started on the super sonic song.....,,
Lots of jank and scripts breaking/flying off stages that is typical of the 3D games. But I was having enough fun to put up with it. The game is very quick to let you try again and objectives are short enough to where the bugs seem more like a small nuisance than game breaking. I had fun throughout the entire game.,,
"Sonic Frontiers is the best Sonic game I have played in a long time. It is the first Sonic game to not use the boost formula after so long. The exploration is fun and seeing all the different paths you can unlock makes you want to explore all the islands. Combat is fun too, not as complicated as Sonic Unleashed which I liked. I wish you could upgrade your speed and ring counts by more than one level. A must try for any Sonic fan, it will not disappoint! Can't wait to see what Sonic Team does next with this open world gameplay. I would love to see more interesting environments in the future.",,
"Extremely well done game. My only problem is that it's made for controller, making some controls really weird. For example: you can't pause with the Escape key, you have to pause with ""P."" Though, once you get used to it, it feels fine.",,
"It's hard to blindly recommend this game.

Frontiers struggles in a lot of places, from inconsistent level design to frankly annoying collectible design (why yes, you do need 300 of this one collectible to hear one side story) to frustrating achievement design (Combo Crackerjack).

When it's good, it's amazing. Running through the world feels super fun. The open-world bosses are fun (except when the game re-spawns bosses you've already beaten...). The bosses at the end of each world are fun. And the game's writing is great. It brings a genuine heartfelt story and mature characters that get you to care about the relationships between them.

But when it's bad, oh, it's bad. About 1/3 of the levels are frustrating and require rather precise maneuvers to achieve S rank times on. Then 1/3 of the levels you can sit for 30 seconds and still hit an S rank with ease. Sonic sometimes just stops dead if you do a certain combination of inputs, completely losing all his momentum. Camera control gets randomly taken away from you at certain times, making it hard to control Sonic in the open world (especially that one enemy on Ares island...). And some mini boss designs are...well, frustrating, at best.

Overall, I feel like this is a good game. It's rough around the edges, probably worth waiting to buy on discount/sale, but if you like Sonic or platforming games, this is probably worth playing eventually.",,

"This game was nothing like the sonic games I had played when I was younger, what I can say is that this was a very welcome change and it was pretty dam amazing, the only drawback to the game was that the main bosses for each island were pretty anti climactic and not very hard considering they were major bosses, (with the exception of hard mode final boss, that was pretty intense.) Besides that everything else was fantastic, it was fun grinding to collect things to unlock further necessary things, and the puzzles were enticing and straightforward, the story-telling shone above it all and the game had a very bittersweet story from start to end.

"DISCLAIMER: This review is pretty unstructured/messy and contains MAJOR SPOILERS, so there's your warning.

And if any member of Sega/Sonic Team sees this, please read the entire review. I have praise as well as constructive criticism.

Sonic Frontiers is actually a legitimately good game. I'd be lying if I said it was a flawless game, but I'd also be lying if i said I didn't have a good time playing this game. And I believe I have experienced enough of this game to make a somewhat adequate review.

The main gameplay: The main gameplay of Frontiers involves going about the Starfall Islands and collecting memory tokens, portal gears, vault keys and chaos emeralds, while fighting robots and guardians as well as, at the end of each island (with one exception), a titan. You will also go through these little obstacle courses involving grind rails, balloons, springs and other gimmicks, and these courses are how you get memory tokens. Despite the simplicity, these courses can be quite fun and satisfying, especially when you chain multiple courses. My favourite instances of these would be the courses leading up to the 6th chaos emerald of each island. The combat is quite cool but parrying is a bit too easy (if there is another Sonic game like Frontiers in the future, it would be good so that you have to properly time the parry). The skill tree is pretty neat, but it would be cool if you could press a certain of sequence of buttons to pull off a cool and powerful attack, like in Sonic Unleashed. The guardian fights can be enjoyable, but can also be tedious and repetitive at times. The map and grind rails are much appreciated to allow for navigation of the island, which isn't that tedious. The puzzles required to unlock these can be very simple (stand on these squares in a specific order, stand on these buttons, and stuff like that), but I honestly don't mind too much (but puzzles a tad more challenging, not too frustrating, would be appreciated). I personally found the chaos emerald minigames to be quite tedious and annoying, and was glad that the final island completely omitted these minigames. Like they weren't abhorrent, but they weren't exactly fun. Also Frontiers has some of the worst pop-in I've EVER seen in a game. Like it's not game-breaking, but it's definitely distracting, really hope it gets fixed.

Kronos Island is more or less the perfect introduction to what the rest of the game is going to be like, with appropriate difficulty and it is relatively intuitive to navigate.

Ares Island is a neat next step, but could maybe have done more with the desert setting (maybe add a pyramid or two, idk might just be me).

Chaos Island might actually be my favourite, as I like the volcanic setting and personally find the island easy to navigate, due to the distinct parts of the island (the death egg robot, the volcano, the lake area etc.)

Rhea Island is rather simple (climb 6 towers and shut them off), but I honestly enjoyed it.

And Ouranos Island is rather similar to Kronos Island, but still manages to distinguish itself from the introductory island.

Cyberspace: I honestly liked the Cyberspace levels. Yeah the reused level themes and assets from previous games, yes Sonic is rather slow and stiff, and yes they are pretty short stages, but you know what? There not bad. I personally found them to be quite enjoyable and fulfilling, even if they are not the best example of boost formula Sonic, a title I would bestow to either Unleashed or Generations. So despite the fact they are rather derivative, the Cyberspace gameplay just about gets a thumbs up from me (BUT PLEASE HAVE ORIGINAL, FAST AND EXHILARATING NEXT TIME LIKE YOU DID WITH UNLEASHED).

The fishing: The fishing in this game is neat, and absolutely makes up for the terrible fishing from Sonic Adventure, and it's nice to see Big again. My favourite part would be the Egg Memos, which give some interesting lore insights, as well as Eggman's POV.

The characters: IT IS SO GOOD TO SEE ALL THE CHARACTERS ACT LIKE THEY SHOULD! BRAVO, WRITERS

Sonic is great here. He's cocky and confident, but also cares about others and knows when to be serious
Amy is passionate and wants to help the world
Knuckles is a competent warrior who is the guardian of the master emerald (traits that Lost World and Forces completely forgot)
Tails is intelligent, he wants to grow as a person and be a hero in his own right (a lot like adventure 1 and 2, the games where I personally believe Tails to be at his best, character-wise), and I absolutely love that they address and are attempting to undo the severe damage that was done to his character in Forces (same goes for Knuckles)
Eggman is shown to be competent, but they still manage to make entertaining, and even caring
And Sage is a welcome new addition to the cast, a much better character than Infinite

The story: While interesting, I feel that the story is kinda half-baked by the end. Like there's so many interesting ideas and mysteries here, but they aren't really fully fleshed out or answered (like what exactly happens to the Koco and the Starfall Islands at the end? What exactly are the chaos emeralds' origins and how are they connected to the master emerald? Who or what exactly is the end and how did it come into conflict with the Ancients?). Still, I like that each character gets their moment to shine and Sage's development was pretty good.

Lore implications: I LOVE HOW THIS GAME ACKNOWLEDGES THE PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED AND AIMS TO REMAIN CONSISTENT WITH SAID LORE!
I love all the callbacks to previous Sonic games (Station Square - Sonic Adventure, GUN and the space colony ARK - Sonic Adventure 2, Neo Metal Sonic- Sonic Heroes, Dark Gaia - Sonic Unleashed), it's great to see a sense of continuity again, and it's also great to see that Tangle (and maybe the rest of the IDW cast) and Sticks are now canon to the main series, and I'm eager to see what the games will possibly do with these characters in the future. It's about time we got an origin story to the chaos emeralds, even if said origin is still missing pieces, and it's interesting that the chao are the 'descendants' of the Ancients (or at least I'm sure that's what that Egg Memo was implying).

The boss fights: These go HARD!...well, the first 3 do
Giganto is the perfect titan to start with, as he's basic and gives you good sense of what the titan fights will be like
Wyvern might be my favourite, as flying with him is just so cool and breathtaking AND THAT ONE PART WHERE SUPER SONIC THROWS HIM INTO A MOUNTAIN!!! LOVE IT!
Knight is also pretty epic, but I found his fight to be kinda tedious at times (he would move out of the way just as I would launch his shield back at him), but he still delivers on the spectacle. LIKE SUPER SONIC PICKS UP HIS SWORD AND CUTS HIM IN HALF WITH IT!!!!!!!
Supreme is...lacking. He's the final titan (final boss, if you're playing on easy/normal difficulty), and he's the easiest/shortest.
The End is a complete disaster of a final boss in my honest opinion. Why is the final boss of a SONIC GAME a BULLET HELL!?!? After all the main bosses being big awesome giant robots, we end with a floating purple moon? I don't like it, not one bit. It was a a bad blemish on an otherwise mostly enjoyable game. At least the music is kind of alright, speaking of...

The music: the main songs used throughout the game are great, but the vocal tracks for the first 3 titans ARE ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL! SEGA PLEASE BRING BACK KELLIN QUINN AND TYLER SMYTH FOR THE NEXT SONIC GAME SOUNDTRACK PLEASE!!! The other vocal tracks are good too.


AND TO SEGA/SONIC TEAM: This game is not perfect, it has it's flaws (pop-in, awful final boss, etc.), but you have done something incredible: you made a good Sonic game. Even though this game is objectively alright, it has got me VERY excited for the future of the franchise. I really hope the next game is even better and can be viewed as a legitimate masterpiece.",,

"After a decade of spinoffs, retro revivals and experimentation, Sonic Team has finally released a game that manages to both be fun by itself and pave the way for the future of the blue blur.
It's got some glitches here and there, and some wanky moments, but overall it brings us a game that feels great to play, a world that's fun to explore, and a story that is surprisingly mature; not edgy, not unecessarily dark, but genuinely heartfelt in a way I wasn't expecting it to be.",,
"Best 3D Sonic game in a while...3rd Island is the worst section by far and 4th Island shouldn't even be called ''Island'' since there's nothing to do there...Some parts of the level design frustrates me with mostly holding the player's hand andThe jump doesn't carry your speed and momentum...Also Cyber Spaces are easily the worst part of the game by far...

It's a fun game that tries to change the usual 3D Sonic formula which came with Unleashed...But ıt needs a lotta fine-tunning to make the whole thing work

I say with the movies and the new released TV Show the future of Sonic seems to be bright...

Hope the upcoming Free content will make this game even better...

This game makes me happy :),,
its a fun game so far a bit confusing at first but gets clearer as you continue in the game . the controls are much better then for the most part anyways then generations. it is hard to carry your speed in the game unless you use the boost . granted i am playing on easy so that may be why . either way would say get it. i only had one crash in the game during load up . i think that one was from my computer being a Frankenstein's monster computer. it has beautiful graphics and great atmosphere.,,
"I have played literally every 3D sonic game out there and I have to say, this is easily in the top 3 (first and 2nd being sonic adventure 2 and sonic unleashed respectively imo). The open world is great, the fps is consistent, the visuals are good enough for an open world sonic game with a lot of RPG elements but yeah I do believe they could have been better (switch is to blame lol). The pop ins are noticeable but not a deal breaker. However, I certainly hope they will fix that in the later games if they continue to go with this formula.

Lets talk combat and enemy variety. The combat at first seemed off and weak to me but as I progressed more into the game, I started to enjoy the new various combos and movesets that I unlocked which weren't super easy to execute all the time unless you enabled auto combos lol.

For enemy variety, the normal enemies are okay, sometimes boring and sometimes a little fun but the optional bosses are really cool and give you a tough time every now and then. And of course, the best bosses are the main bosses that you beat with super sonic and let me tell you, THAT IS REALLY FUN, THE BEST SUPER SONIC FIGHTS WE EVER GOT!

Last but not the least, I have another gripe which are the rehashed (mostly) cyberspace stages that run and look very similar to the previous sonic stages we have already played a 100 times in the previous sonic titles which I would have accepted, had the stages also not been so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ short. Yeah, that will be all. To sum it all up, A GREAT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR SONIC, LOOKING FORWARD TO FINISHING THE GAME AND THEN WAITING FOR THE NEXT ONE!

"So we all know the reputation of 3D Sonic games just being bad. This one def breaks that cycle. The ""open zone"" Is like the biggest Level select I've ever seen. The Fun comes from just seeing what crazy thing Sonic will run through. The only con I can think of is some things just take to long i.e. upgrades and unlocking things take so long you can skip them but you miss some information.",,
"Product received for free

My initial thought was ""It's too empty."" Then I realised that Frontiers felt like a love letter to the Sonic Adventure fanbase. Hardcore fans of the aging Dreamcast and Gamecube games can dive into this, tweak a few settings and start challenging themselves to get the best times possible with an updated physics engine. It's Sonic. He's rebellious as **** and you're gonna land in the drink, a lot. My biggest gripes are: Tutorials being repeated when you fail a quest. **** off. You fixed the stage reload times SEGA. Don't do this, or have a skip tutorials option. The time it takes to open a stage. Otherwise it's an adventure playground of crazy loops, springs, rings and robots. Go nuts. Sonic. Best game I didn't realise i wanted 2022. (Actually that was Celeste.)",,
"Wow. I've been a Sonic fan for as long as I've been a gamer. My first Sonic game (and first game period) was Mega Collection for the GameCube and I was absolutely obsessed with the blue blur for many years. As I got older, the games were still decent but there was a steady decline in quality and, while games like Generations and Mania are fantastic, the majority of their content primarily banks on nostalgia and old level design to deliver the goods. I was content with games like those but part of me longed for something more. Something new. Then Sonic Forces came out and coming fresh off the heels of Mania I was so ready for a new 3D adventure but, well... If you played you know, that was definitely not what fans of the series were looking for. I felt so burned by Forces that I had given up hope for a good quality 3D Sonic game at that point. I saw the teasers for Frontiers and those horrid IGN gameplay demos and my mind was unchanged. I was simply not feeling the hype and was personally questioning why they would even bother showing off a project so clearly not ready for release. Then the game came out and I was not there for the release date. I did read some professional reviews and saw that it was getting pretty good scores even amid some complaints about technical issues and general jank. Then I saw the Steam store page and the positive response from the average player. I decided that I would keep an eye out for a sale and maybe, just maaaaybe, I would reluctantly part with a few bills to check it out. Then came the sale and I picked it up for $41 (which seems just right btw). Let me tell you I went into this game with a totally straight face. There wasn't the usual excitement when starting a new game for the first time. I simply felt nothing for the series at this point. After getting through the admittedly annoying tutorial pop-ups that plagued the first 10-15 minutes of gameplay however, something changed. I boosted across a hill and performed a string of jumps and light dashes across some springs and rails and I felt a smirk creep up on my face. Something long forgotten had re-awakened within me in that moment. The simple pleasure of just zipping around an open environment as Sonic. It brought back memories of trying to get out of bounds in Station Square, spin-dashing and jumping off anything and everything just to see him fly. For the first time in recent memory Sonic was a joy to control in a 3D space. As I started to explore the new world before me I realized that this game, this game that I so desperately wanted to dislike, was precisely the game my inner child wanted all those years ago. If this had released when I was a kid I would have totally lost my mind. The game is certainly not perfect. There are bugs and questionable collision detection and other forms of jank to the level design but looking back I would challenge you to find a 3D Sonic game without any of those issues. I'm not very far into it yet but I can say for the first time in so long that I'm excited to play a Sonic game, and I can't explain how good it feels to be able to say that again. Sega and Sonic team would do well to take all of the positive feedback surrounding this release and refine the formula they have here into a future sequel. I know that they have a reputation for throwing the baby out with the bathwater in seemingly every subsequent release but I can proudly say for now that my faith in this franchise is rekindled. Thank you to all who were involved with the making of this game, if for no other reason than making my inner child smile at the sight of Sonic once again.",,
Haven't played a sonic game since sonic heroes. I gotta say I always had faith in this title and I am so happy my friend got this for me!,,
Honestly I'm not liking the gameplay and not a fan of Sonic games.. BUT the music is BANGING so hard,,
"Miraculous fresh start for the series. Moving around the open world feels natural, fun, and most importantly, fast. Combat nails the feel of being a league above all your enemies, but only in terms of speed, so the challenge comes in choosing when to attack with Sonic's new much more varied moveset. As always in Sonic the music and animation is incredible, but for the first time in a long time the gameplay quality catches up.
Bringing Ian Flynn on as the writer for a game is a godsend. The characters feel fleshed out and real, the story is more interesting than it's been since Unleashed at least, but possibly ever.
Lastly, though perhaps most critically, everything functions and the game is polished. No 06 flashbacks here.

Overall, 9/10, very few complaints. Sonic might be running in the right direction again.",,
"FINALLY

A GOOD 3D SONIC GAME FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A DECADE

THANK THE HEAVENS",,
it's a great game,,
Fast,,
This is too damn fun,,
"Strange but fun
And of course the OST is fire",,
"not allowed to go fast during certain sections, 1.5/10

In all seriousness, this game was pretty great and the soundtrack is phenomenal, although I thought the ending was a little weak and I dreaded having to scroll and press A to upgrade my speed and ring cap 1 level at a time. It's nice to see Sonic get another W after so long",,
"This is the first modern Sonic game I have enjoyed since Generations. The idea of running around an open world with a whole bunch of random objects seems extremely unappealing to look at, but actually playing the game is like a roller coaster. It isn't perfect, but it accomplishes it's purpose: fun game play. This is the best Sonic has controlled... probably EVER. This game will SERIOUSLY test your reaction timing if you decide to blitz through stages and the open zones. The stages themselves are leagues ahead of Sonic Forces, but some of the Cyber Space levels need some work. I also think the combat can be expanded on. As it is now, combat is basic. Which is okay I guess. I like sonic for the high speed game-play.

My biggest critique of this game is the lack of environments. Generally speaking, Sonic has very vibrant locations that I feel Sonic Team should be taking advantage of. Green Hill Zone has appeared in just about every single game since Generations, and at this point I just groan whenever I have to look at that checkered-dirt pattern. This goes for Chemical Plant and Sky Sanctuary. I'm NOT SAYING these are bad, I would just like to see the team utilize other locations in the future. Think about it: How hype would it have been to see SA2 Metal Harbor again? Or even a re-imagining of a Sonic CD location such as Metallic Madness in a 3D environment?? These stages are pulled from Sonic's past according to the devs. I noticed segments of Speed Highway (SA1) and Dragon Road (Unleashed) while playing. But the visuals are just not there.

The story is bland. I won't go too deep into detail of the overall plot, but it was predictable. I can't really fault Ian Flynn, the main writer. For it's issues. Where most people tend to compare his writing to that of ""Family Guy"" quips, where Sonic and friends just casually bring up the ARK or the Deadly Six. Or characters such as Tangle who have yet to appear in the mainline series. I believe Flynn did everything in his power to try to place the generally incoherent lore of Sonic together. I did find myself saying ""Ah, I remember that."" A handful of times. It was actually kind of nice, though I understand if people find it annoying. The character development is where the game really shines. Where games like Colors and Lost World I feel bastardized the blue blur, I can safely say this is my favorite version of Sonic and friend's personalities.

I liked the music. The metal-core boss fight songs are fun to listen to, and the over-world tracks are great too. The Cyberspace levels are hit or miss though. I like some of the Drum and Bass songs and the vocal tracks but the rest of them aren't for me, although do I hope other people enjoy them. My favorite song personally is ""Find your Flame.""

I can't be too harsh on Sonic Team. Reusing assets is commonplace in the gaming industry, and with a team of about 60 people, taking nearly 5 years to make this is impressive. This is a big step up from previous titles, but it's not quite ""there"" yet. Here's hoping the next game will be crazy insane.",,
"Kellin quinn??? In my sonic game???
Likelier than you think.",,
its never time to not fast,,
WILL THE WHOOOOLE WOOORLD KNOOOOOW YOUUUUUR NAAAAAAAAAAME?!,,
"I just finished it after a fairly casual playthrough, and I just gotta say it.

Damn. What a good game.

Not since the first Adventure game have I felt that if Sonic controlled like this for the rest of time, I would be content with it. That's not to say that the gameplay balance is PERFECT, but it never outstayed its welcome to me. Every Sonic game I've played up to this point(and I have played most of them)has contributed SOMETHING in the positive to this game. In both the story, and the gameplay, it feels like something that truly celebrates being a Sonic game, and it feels so damn good. This game was everything I wanted as a Sonic fan, and more.

Now, on a technical side, I will actually give it some more praise there. Despite being well below the maximum specs, I had a fairly playable experience from the very beginning, and that only continued to improve as the modding community was generous enough to provide minor adjustments to make it run almost perfectly at minimum settings. Hopefully, this gets even better when the free DLC hits.

One part I will gladly clown on, however, is the native Switch button support. I tend to use the Nintendo button layout on most games because I like it better in most use cases, especially on Sonic games. This is the first Sonic game on PC with native button support for various console controllers, and it messes it up by swapping how the face buttons are registered. A is B, X is Y, etc. I had to use the mod loader to force Xbox buttons in order to fix this issue, which is frankly quite embarrassing. I was happy that my Sonic themed Wired Fight Pad Pro(look it up)was more than perfect for this game, but the buttons issue was quite disappointing, especially since, unlike Forces, you need to MANUALLY set up controller support in the Steam settings. Hope that gets fixed in a future update.",,
Sonic Team finally made a great sonic game not perfect but god this game is good the updates are overall pretty good but Jesus Christ 100% is an absolute slog and not worth your time,,

somic,,
Someone tell me why upgrading your SPEED is so dang SLOW,,
Why did I add to the numbers for this game. Мой друг!,,
"I have finally completed the game, along with 100%-ing Cyberspace, all of the islands and the achievements of the game. Whilst I am not likely to revisit this game until the DLC comes out, I figured: ""Why not write a review of this game?"". And that's what I will do:

**AS PER USUAL, SPOILER ALERT**

First off, let's get the dreadful bits outta the way.
THE BAD:
-Pop in is damn well awful.
-The islands can be janky to run around.
-The speed/ring leveling system is SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BAD, why they didn't do the same as the attack/defense system is beyond me.
-Platforming sections in the island can be extremely restrictive at times (lookin' at you, Chaos Island).
-2D Cyberspace is (mostly) garbage.
-3D Cyberspace doesn't allow Sonic to move nearly as well as the main islands do.
-Cyberspace is probably some of the slowest Sonic's been during all of his legacy, with the exception of Sonic Labyrinth.
-Maybe this was my controller, but sometimes Sonic'd boost out of the blue for no reason.
-Once you level up Sonic's attack enough, boss fights become really easy.
-Some mini-bosses could be not-so-fun to play against, as the game *really* emphasizes one and only one way to beat them.
-Final boss was a bit of a letdown*. (We'll come back to this)

Oh boy, now here we go:
THE GOOD:
-Unlike Ken Pontac, Ian Flynn isn't a cuck and can actually write for characters given their background, making for what arguably is the best characterization we've ever gotten in a Sonic game, even going as far as reasonably fixing the fiasco that was the ""Sonic, help me!"" bit in Sonic Forces.
-The characters actually have brains, Sonic has matured, Tails wants to carve his own path, Knuckles is back to doing his guarding duty, and Amy is now more than just a Sonic fangirl, and Eggman is more than just another generic corny villain.
-The animated cutscenes are some of the most expressive bits of Sonic & co. we've ever seen.
-The main islands really are the meat and potatoes of this game. Running around feels extremely good, and the platforming sections can be extremely fun (especially Ares Island, Rhea Island and Ouranos Island).
-The combat, while not comparable to the likes of Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, is certainly good and fun to play around with. Most mini-bosses are extremely fun to fight, with my personal favourites being the Tank, the Fortress and the Catterpillar.
-3D Cyberspace is a slightly mixed bag, with some mid levels, although most of them are good. However, there are three levels that I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ loved with all of me: 4-2, 4-4 and 4-5. These were, without a doubt, the most fun original Cyberspace levels to me, and could work ***EXTREMELY*** well as bases for future boost levels in following installments.
-Speaking of boost, boost-2-win is no longer a thing. You actually have to think to play the game.
-Some of the levels may be gimmicky, like 4-9 with its skateboarding and 3-5 trying out drifting, but seeing Sonic Team test these new ideas, as well as revisiting stages from the Adventure era gives me hope for other levels in the future as well.
-Extremely accessible sliders to help control the feel of Sonic.
-Simple skill tree.
-While most of the puzzles were easy, they weren't dreadful to carry out, the complete opposite in fact.
-The puzzles that weren't easy were a blast to complete.
-Island specific minigames are extremely fun, giving you a breath of fresh air every now and then.
-Big's fishing minigame is not only very relaxing, but is actually busted in terms of progression, so if you're tired of running around, you can very much go to Big for some ez tokens.
-Super Sonic fights are the best in the franchise. The spectacle is amazing, the bosses can be tough, and anything any other SS fights could throw at SS fights in Sonic Frontiers just gets blown out of the water indiscriminately.
-Remember how I mentioned the last boss being a bit of a letdown? That's because it's just a Touhou minigame. However, the fight itself isn't boring, and the ending cutscene, along with the music accompanying both it and the fight completely make up for it and then some.
-Free updates in the future, giving us more content.

As you can see, the pros blow the cons out of the water. It is a good game with inmense ambition and I love Sonic Team for giving it their best for us to have some good ol' fashioned fun. Sure, they were a 60-man team and SEGA being a Japanese company doesn't help with the fact that they were on a time crunch, but they pulled through, and I thank them for it. Hopefully, the DLC gives us fun for the next year to come, and hopefully the next game will be amazing.

Sonic Team, we have given you a lot of flak for the past few years. But to know that you aren't making Sonic games out of spite but rather out of passion gives me (or us, rather) hope for the future of Sonic.

I have said it a lot throughout this review and I will keep saying it.

Thank you.

P.D. Forgot to say:
-The music ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BANGS.
-Sage is a nice addition to the cast.",,
Pretty fun game Overall. Deff some frustrating moments with certain mechanics (mostly due to lack of control to player) but aside from those moments the game itself holds up well as a good 3d sonic game.,,
finally a good 3d sonic game since generation,,
"Initially when I saw Sonic Frontiers for the first time, I had lost all hope for Sega. But as time went on and I saw more and more of the game, I started to have more faith for this product.

Now that I was able to sit down and try it out, I feel like my concerns are mostly gone. Playing Frontiers was a relatively enjoyable experience and I was surprised how they managed to handle the story compared to the previous games.

While I did enjoy my time in the open world and going through the stages and bosses, I can't help but feel as if Sega needed more time to work on Frontiers. A lot of the world objects don't feel like they belong in the world, especially with the platforms and rails floating in the sky. I also wish that the Star Islands were more distinct, visually speaking.

The combat leaves much to be desired too. While it is satisfactory at best, I can't help but feel disappointment whenever I try to do specific actions like jumping out of a boost, only for the game to force me to use a special move.

Despite all of the problems I encountered, I still enjoy this game. I just hope Segas development team will receive a better budget with their next game lol.",,
"The most fun I have had with a Sonic game in years. It's not perfect, but it is a step in the right direction for a series that has been losing it's footing for the past 11 years. Sonic controls the best he has since Sonic Generations, released in 2011. The music is has some of the best tracks in the series (especially the vocal boss themes). The Super Sonic fights are fire! The visuals actually look next-gen again for the first time since Unleashed, which came out in 2008. An actual good story for the first time in 11 years, thanks to Ian Flynn. Characters have arcs in the game too! I am shocked how much I loved this game. Thought I would come out not really caring about it that much, but I was so wrong.

My only problems with the game are lack of aerial momentum (patched in after launch via a free update and can be turned on or off in the game settings), the cyberspace levels, and Rhea Island being a huge waste of an island. The lack of carried aerial momentum in some of Sonic's movement options is very jarring, thankfully, since this is the PC version, this can be fixed with a mod or two (This personal issue of mine was addressed in one of the free content updates, it can be toggled on and off in the setting). The Cyberspace Levels are disappointing at worst and subpar at best, but if you are a Sonic fan you probably already knew that. Sonic Team/SEGA, please stop reusing level design and assets from past games. It is no longer charming, it is forced nostalgia pandering and just lazy at this point. Rhea Island is literally just scaling a couple of towers and watching some story cutscenes. It is a massive disappointment when you actually look at the earlier version of Rhea Island. Even the gorgeous scenery in the final game's version of Rhea is literally not utilized by the game or seen by most players due to there being no reason to go back there.

Solid game otherwise! Would recommend to veteran and new Sonic Fans!

What a brilliant BUT flawed game, the boss battles are like, the worst thing to ever come out of this game, just flat out uninteresting and boring. Cyberspace was fine enough, the controls were stiff and it was pretty easy, but even then, with all those flaws I STILL ENJOYED THIS GAME, I just felt so good about Sonic after all these years of disappointment after disappointment and I cannot wait what the next game (or DLC) brings to the series. I like this game :)

W Sonic Game.,,
"For the first time in a long time I proclaimed that this felt like Sonic should feel. This game is a huge step forward for the franchise and is overall a fun experience. The story was cute, the combat was simple but effective, and the art quality is really good.

That being said a couple of pitfalls...
1: The puzzles were mindless tasks. Beyond the first puzzle, which was light based, it came down to an extremely generic. 'Match the colors! :D'
2: This game probably has the worst final boss in the history of modern gaming. For those that don't know the final final boss is hidden behind the hard difficulty. If you haven't experienced it yet, save just before the fight with the last guardian and just pop your difficulty up to hard. Beat the guardian and bathe in the essence of the worst final boss ever.

Overall the game is easily an 8 /10.
Very fun experience. A good, solid sonic game. Until the ending. The ending left a LOT to be desired. Your final boss should not have less hype behind it, less effort behind it than those that came before it. Its the one thing that left me absolutely disappointed. Thats it and I'm good about finding things to complain about.

I hope to see more in the future. Can't wait to see how you improve on this new formula, if you choose to do so.",,
"I haven’t played a Sonic game since Gamecube era, so I’d like to think I’m fairly non-biased. I 100%’d collectibles and got all the trophies and had fun pretty much the entire time. My main complaint was though combat was fun and enemy and boss designs varied and unique, the rpg mechanics were kind of broken and I ended up leveling way too fast so even on hard difficulty it was pretty easy. The level/ world design was solid and platforming and collecting was consistently fun throughout and I even thought Cyber Space levels were fine because you spent a comparably short time with them as to the rest of the game. I 100%’d every Cyber Space level and it was fun and challenging to do, but I only had a really hard time with maybe three or four of them; I just wish their themes were more varied. If you’re a fan of 3D platformers and open world games, do yourself a favor and get this. It’s easily one of the best games I’ve played all year.",,

"Gameplay – 9/10
Sonic Frontiers has two distinctive gameplay styles – the Cyberspace stages and the new “open zone” areas.
The Cyberspace stages use the same boost formula that we’ve seen in previous Sonic titles such as Generations and Colors Ultimate. The Cyberspace stages are a blast, every stage feels well designed. There’s plenty of replay value too thanks to each stage having multiple goals – S Rank the stage, collect a certain number of rings and collect all five Red Rings.

Frontiers’ open zone areas are a much needed and welcome addition to the Sonic franchise. The open zones offer a similar gameplay experience to other modern, open world games. Open zones are packed with enemies to fight, puzzles to solve and collectibles to collect. There are hours of gameplay to be had just exploring the open zones, this contrasts nicely with the shorter Cyberspace stages.

Combat has been overhauled in the open zone areas. Sonic’s move set has been expanded to add new skills and a combo system. The combat system needed updating to add some complexity and depth to the open zone enemies and boss fights, but I do feel like it’s one of the weaker areas of the game and something that could be improved in future titles.

Story – 7/10
Sonic Frontiers’ story isn’t ground-breaking, but the story that it does tell is well written and an enjoyable experience. The boss fights are a notable high point in the game.

The story pacing does suffer a little bit due to the design of the open zone gameplay. I found myself playing for hours in between story beats. This isn’t a problem that’s exclusive to Sonic Frontiers – it’s a gripe I’ve had with almost every open world game that I have played.


Sonic Frontiers is visually impressive. The Cyberspace stages are vibrant and oozing with style, the open zone areas are equally as impressive.

Pop-in is an issue in the open zone areas. Sometimes it can be difficult to navigate the open zone areas due to platforms being outside of the game’s draw distance. I hope to see this fixed in a future patch.


Sonic Frontiers is a return to form for Sonic. It’s a fresh take that has left me feeling very excited for the future of the franchise.",,
I loved this game. SEGA MORE OF THIS PLEASE. MUSIC 10/10 GAMEPLAY 10/10 MECHANICS 10/10. PLEASE DO NOT GO BACK TO SONIC FORCES.,,
gotta go fest,,
"Sonic is back!

Well, he never really went anywhere, he just sort of comes and goes but this time, Sonic Team and Sega have delivered us a banger of a fun, chonky game to enjoy. My biggest fear involved the game having terrible controls and not enough content. I can say that the game quickly dissuaded any worries I had going in.

The controls are responsive and more tight than I expected. There's still the occasional 3D Sonic jank where he just jets off in the wrong direction or game eats your inputs, as well as some camera angles that make wall-running a pain. That's all mostly a side effect of 3D platforming.

The visuals are a mixed bag. Cyberspace zones look phenomenal and pack a lot of visual variety. The island zones however, are hit and miss. They look quite plain and feature a lot of pop-in, but they do also have a sharpness to them and can feel relaxing to just run through.

The sound in this game is phenomenal. I hear there is a soundtrack releasing on Dec. 7th and if you have no interest in playing this game, buy that soundtrack. It's incredible.

The voice acting is also hit and miss. Sonic and Tails sound good. Amy sounds pretty generic, as does Sage. Knuckles sounds like he did pre-Idris Elba taking the character over. Big the cat, forget Big, he is a mistake.

The main thing that makes this game a success to me, is that the gameplay loop and level design are inspired. Each island zone has a ton of little challenges, enemies and tracks for Sonic to complete and play on. Each category of objectives has a ton of variety to experience and each zone has new enemies or enemy variants and the same goes for challenges. When you top that off with the most epic of boss fights I've ever experienced in a 3D platformer, you have a great game. The best 3D platformer since Mario Odyssey. It's a must play.",,
"I can say this is the best Sonic game ever played
- Imagine run with Sonic speed in open zone
- Bring back old stage gameplay
- Simple but good story
- No grinding
- Combo and skills are good",,
ITS TIME TO FACE YOUR FEEAR,,
"This game is pretty good. Even though it has its fair share of flaws, it's a pretty good game. Cyberspace could've been way better but is a fun experience to try and speedrun with it's kinda whack physics. Open zone gameplay is pretty nice. Exploration always felt fun and almost never like a chore. The combat is pretty fun but gets quite broken after lvl 35. The titan bosses are basically the best part of the game in my opinion. The build up and combat experience are really exhilarating.

I rate the game a 7.3/10",,
"A lot of content for adrenaline junkies and old nostalgic Fast paced Parkour Sonic Games ;D Personnaly i didn't want to pay 80$ like i always brag about when a new console game comes out but let's say i'm more than glad that i did for this once. Like i said a LOT of content and stuff to do for the graphics i find certain aspects and moods, lightings at different time of day is gorgeous and breathtaking, Gameplay wise i'd say it feels like the more you level up the more obsessed you become with speed (Speed over rings everytime) loll and the fights altough they feel sometimes a bit childish within the small action sequences almost gives you instant seizures but feels really punchy has Sonic beats the hell out of anything that comes in his path. The Story is ok and feels right with all the characters united the japanese anime style felt a bit weird at first but soon came the EPIC titanesques creatures and then i was mindblown by all this action and ideas they had creating this game i give it a solid 8/10",,
"It's a good Sonic game. Player's are running Free like Sonic would, the character's have some depth and Eggman sounds like the genius he needs to be. While I can't tell if the Speed Leveling is actually affecting Sonic's over all speed while boosting; the whole field to run around in, bounce and take off is still absolutely gorgeous to a point where I need to just say if the next Sonic Adventure would be on the docket to build it kind of like this with multiple character's in mind.

The only bug or 2 I've come across are the game crashing and the physic's giving a small hiccup, but these are incredibly rare and it feels like this game was given a chance to iron everything out.

The biggest improvement Sonic Frontiers has over other titles like Breath of the Wild and Skyrim is that FAST TRAVEL is INSTANTANEOUS or at least on PC. Get the Item or meet the condition for Fast Travel, pick a spot to travel too and BOOM, no loading bar, Sonic is just there which I kind of find that impressive from a coding perspective and have to ask how that was accomplished; Even loading between the gate's and the overworld doesn't take long to my perspective of it and the practice sessions in between loading help's you get back into practice if you've been away from it.

This game is TOP NOTCH, the Music, Control's, Gameplay, Story Development; If Sega doesn't get back on it's feet after this, I would be surprised.

Keep it up Sega; we're waiting on you to catch up and your catching up faster than we expected.",,

"A Return To Relevance For Sonic & Sega

This is something I have been waiting for since the 90's. Not since I was a child on the Sega Genesis playing the original 3 Sonics have I been so thoroughly engrossed by a blue hedgehog (Hollywood movies aside).
Sure, Generations was fun, and Mania was a return to the beautiful 2D Pixels bygone days, but nothing has screamed ""I am STILL a relevant IP"" in decades from this team. Pumping out either ""meh"" titles, downright ""horrible"" titles, or nostalgia induced cash grabs.

The Pros:
For any fan of Shadows of the Colossus and Breath of the Wild, this game is for you, it's an odd Sonic Mash-Up of the two. The ""stages"" feel kind of like more in depth shrines from BotW, and the big bads are, well, you get the idea. It's a fun experimentation in open world for the Sonic Team, and is definitely pushing the series in the right direction. I want to see more of this. Sonic no longer feels slow, which he has since he left 2D and entered the 3D world. The character progression system has a unique integration without making it feel too much like an RPG or JRPG. All in all, a great first outing in to the open world for this IP.

The Cons:
The 3D portals (Stages) still feel sluggish and hard to control, which has been a problem for almost every 3D Sonic Game. Luckily, this is limited to the stages and doesn't affect the open world mechanics.
Minor Glitches with switching grinding rails where Sonic will turn and go in the wrong direction.
Can't switch costumes in the game, you have to go back out to the main menu.
Cosmetics are all DLC or digital deluxe, from what I can see at almost 10 hours in. No cosmetics naturally received in game.

Overall score: 8.5

Bonus: Sonic Team Official Twitter has announced that all DLC on the roadmap will be free.",,

This game is the one I have wanted since Generations and the story I have wanted to see since Black Knight and I am OBSESSED with this game, everything about this game I am gonna remember for a long time and considering the game is gonna get major free updates soon for more content.

I am more excited about this game than I have ever been since the 2000's! Thank you Sonic Team for trusting your gut for once and stuck to your guns for this game, I haven't felt this content for everything in a Sonic title since Unleashed and Black Knight,

"Elden Ring might be the best open world game this year, but Sonic Frontiers is the most fun. Frankly, it's one of the best gaming experiences I've had in the last few years. While the game might not seem like much at first glance, the amount of freedom this game gives you with exploration, movement, and speed is unmatched. It's got a few rough edges and it's clearly unfinished, but Sonic fan or otherwise, this is a game worth playing if you fancy the sound of going fast in an open environment.

Open Zones are fun and designed to be explored by a supersonic blue hedgehog. Sonic can run fast, launch off platforms, fight towering minibosses, and just take in the sights. Platforming challenges are everywhere and while they're pretty straightforward if you just want to get them over with, they can often be solved in faster, more creative ways. The combat isn't as complex or engaging as DMC and Bayonetta, but it's fun, flashy, and gives you some room for skill expression. The islands may come off as lazy and uninspired, but their desolate beauty is by design and explained in the story. If you feel a bit empty and sad by looking at them, they've fulfilled their purpose.

Speaking of the story, each character gets good development and moments, and it throws a lot of references to previous Sonic games for longtime fans. I liked it, but it gets a bit weaker as the game progresses. I expect the DLC in 2023 will be targeted towards fixing its issues and answering some remaining questions.

Cyberspace levels, the more traditional Sonic fare, are easy to finish, but leave a lot of room for creative and fun speedruns. You might finish all the missions in one go, but the levels are designed to be completed much, much faster than what the S-ranks say. Sonic might feel slow in the beginning, especially in 2D, Sonic Team was fully aware of some speedrunning techniques during development and has definitely taken it into account in the level design. Check the tips at the end for some hints.

And, of course, the soundtrack and Titan bosses have become viral highlights. The soundtrack is absolutely the best OST I've heard this year not only as a gaming soundtrack, but as an album in its own right. EDM, dubstep, drum and bass, melodic pianos, metalcore. The sheer variety on its own is one thing, but they're also good. Like, . Award-winning material, frankly.

All this said, the game is janky, unpolished, and obviously unfinished. The game's quality definitely drops off after the third island, where it simultaneously gets both better and worse. The story gets worse, but the gameplay gets a bit better with stronger minibosses, better Cyberspace levels, and some really fun platforming gauntlets. The ""final"" boss is pretty weak, though there's a true final boss in Hard mode. That boss is very divisive, and I initially didn't like it, but over time I've become much more appreciative of it. Thematically, I think it's a great way to cap the game.

There's a few good metrics for whether or not you'll like Frontiers. One is whether you prefer your games beautifully polished to the point of being restrictive or if you prefer experimental takes which empower the player but in doing so might fall short at times. Another is if you enjoyed messing around in the Adventure Hubs in Sonic Adventure, launching yourself off inclines and running on walls you weren't meant to, or if you hated that part of the game. Either way, Frontiers challenges you to figure it out and reserves its most rewarding techniques for those interested in prying deeper. It's not perfect, but it's the right step for this series, and what a giant leap it is.

Two tips for anyone interested in going super fast:
Open-zone: Boost on inclined rails and jump to go flying. Great for skips and getting places fast.
Cyberspace: Try canceling a homing attack with a boost. You'll see what I mean.",,
"This game is pretty great overall but may not be for everyone, especially if you are new to the series as this game makes references to previous titles. This game has a good story and some really good music (as you may have heard before). The game does have some issues gameplay wise such as really noticeable object pop-ins and the CyberSpace levels control are a bit 'heavy' as I like to put it. However, with all that, this game is still really fun to play and is really fun to pull off combos and do puzzles that unlock more and more of your map. Def recommend! <3",,

"I for one actually LOVE the feeling of this game, Open World Sonic Games should just work through concept and actual design, and this game checks my boxes on that regard. While it is not a perfect game by any means (the vocal direction is a bit off-putting) , you will find enjoyment in not only playing this game, but just experiencing a pretty good Sonic game and story.

Pros:
Phenomenal Open World Mechanics
Love the new gameplay/movesets
Feeling like a Sonic Game while bringing something new
Amazing Combat Patterns!

Cons:
Questionable Voice Direction
Relearning Sonic's Control (not a problem for me, but I see why people talk about it)

I give this a solid 7.9 out of 1, and a thumbs up!",,
"Product received for free

Best Sonic game in the past decade! Very fun to play when you just want to relax and the story is fairly interesting. I see potential in this open world charm and hope that they can incorporate more in the next entry to make it really shine. A few issues I had was that the story was that it wasn't the best I've ever seen if you look more into it. Sage's character development and the Sonic and Tails bond was what really had me wanting to know more. Puzzles are short, but nice addition, and fishing is a really neat and nostalgic feature. Not to mention the soundtrack is fa-nominal. I could not ask for a better soundtrack than this. Overall I would rate this game an 8/10. Highly recommend for newcomers of the Sonic series (although it's best to play through previous games to get a better understanding on the smaller details)",,
"Sonic Frontiers is a good game. Is it the best sonic game ever made? absolutely not, but what is here, is quality. The game lacks some polish, some control and level design decissions are questionable, and the overall world mostly consists of... stock assets in the sky. But in spite of this, the flow of the game is superb. It never gets tiring to control sonic, and jump off rails, air boost your way onto unreachable platforms, slaughter bosses in the blink of an eye, collecting this game equivalent of power moons. It's legit always a fun time. The story was handled really well too, and the bosses were a new standard for the series. I hate to get the experience kinda brought down with the realization that the 4th island is 20 minutes long, the 5th and final one looks JUST like the first one, and the final boss is... a bullet hell, absolutely reprehensible things that lower my opinion of the game. But when the core game is fun, one must simply take a breath and say ""that's cool"". Sonic Frontiers is cool. More of this please, but with more budget next time, sonic team clearly needs it. A somewhat generous 7.5 is my final score.",,
"The game isn't perfect and has a few issues, the biggest one for me being the frame rate dropping every now and then, only being fixed when i go back to the main menu and load my save file again. And there were some instances of Sonic not doing as I was telling him, but that might be me not realising I couldn't do that action at that particular time, I'm not sure.

But overall, I absolutely adore this game! The open world mechanic works well with Sonic, especially with things being structured for him. It's fun to explore the platforming things, but it's also nice that they're not a necessity to get around. Past Sonic stages can be played in cyberspace simulations with a new Frontiers feel to them, and they're pretty fun to try to get all 4 rewards on. I especially love the S rank challenge, trying to speedrun through the levels. Not to mention, the story is fantastic! You find yourself really caring about the characters in the lore, and even the existing Sonic characters get some depth that they haven't had in years. I was moved quite a few times by their interactions and their arcs. And I think Sage might be one of my new favourite characters.

But of course, like most other Sonic games, we have to give a special shout out to the soundtrack. From the atmospheric songs of the open worlds, to the cool techno vibes in the cyberspace levels, to the absolutely incredible boss themes. The boss themes especially blew me away with how amazing they are.

As a long term Sonic fan, I'm very pleased with this game, which is something I haven't felt in a while when playing a new 3D Sonic game. It's not perfect, but I didn't expect it to be. It sure is good though, and I can tell a lot of work went into it. Overall I'd give this game an 8.75/10! I'll definitely be playing more of it, trying to 100% each world and playing the arcade mode.",,

"It's good to see Sega get a Sonic game right. If you're a Sonic fan, I highly recommend this game. The open world aspect felt a bit daunting at first, but they really delivered it well in a way you can expect a platforming game to deliver.

Also impressed with the story and actual life in the cast as opposed to a lot of prior games. Sonic's not the only character with living speech and development. Also there are several homages to the older games in the forms of game play or cutscenes.

If you're a regular Sonic player, just start off on hard difficulty. I found the game to be a breeze difficulty wise, save for a few deaths to bosses that have certain methods to defeat them.",,
"I've play just about every Sonic game in the franchise (Yes '06, Shadow and Forces included) so I think I can say with out a shadow of a doubt (ha) that I really enjoyed this and the direction its taken.

(spoiler free review)
Every level is a test of your path finding skills, every enemy is a test of reflexes or a race against time. Every boss tests you to use what you've learned to overcome them, but in the end it's not unbearably difficult and in fact can play a bit like a rhythm game at times, and at others a bit of a masher.

Mini-games and a variety of different ways to play are also presented with each island and you can mostly take things at your own pace or rush the story as you see fit. The soundtrack is absolute fire (but that's expected from a Sonic Team title come on), and every meshes together quite well.

My only gripes really coming from the other games is that some moves that retained your momentum like the ""LIght Speed Dash"" or ""Homing Attack"" stop you dead here, and weird choices like air speed being null in 2.5d sections unless you double jump which take a bit getting used to. Some enemies might also feel a bit off depending on how you approach them but thankfully you have unlimited lives.

All in all, I started the game on a 7/10 and ended on a 9/10. If you're on the fence, from one Sonic fan to another, buy it and play it.",,

Amazing soundtrack, game play felt smooth, combat was not difficult to understand and use. Sonic felt fast and very flexible, even in cyberspace. Also, the story is well written enough. The call backs to older games was a nice touch as well. I recommend playing the game more than once to experience some of the fights again. In my play through, I did not find many glitches. Just two, but they did not ruin the game. Although I was not actively searching for glitches. If I had one issue with the game, it would be Hermit Koco. I believe I spent an hour just talking to them. If I was personally rating this game, I would rate it around 8.5/10.",,

7/10
Overall, a very solid entry of a Sonic game. Had a blast running around the open worlds and all the fun platforming just felt good. Sonic controls amazingly in this game in the open world and can be fully customized to your liking. The story has some good depth to it and will keep you interested with refences to past games and events. It also sets up Sonics friends to have more growth to them.

Environments are beautiful and will make you want to explore every inch; bosses are some of the most epic in the Sonic franchise with a little Shadow of the Colossus sprinkled in them.

The downside is that the combat system is a meh and comes to a grinding halt as most enemies stop your combos dead. Movements are much less tight in the cyber worlds. No way around it the floating rails in the sky still look awful.
My biggest complaint would be the ending it severely loses steam specifically the final “boss” which is locked under hard was a big letdown compared to past Sonic games final boss but hopefully a setup for something more in future games.

Overall worth picking up one of the best Sonic games in a long time.",,

"Gotta say, as a life time Sonic fan- this is a good direction for the blue blur to go.

The Combat is simple yet satisfying, the story is intriguing and keeps you wanting to explore- yearning to discover the next nugget of the story, the movement and progression feel natural and pleasant. Never once did I feel under powered or like I couldn't beat something unless I leveled up.

All in all- Our blue beloved blur is absolutely crushing through these new frontiers, and I couldn't be more excited for the future.",,
Good game,,

"Great game, highly recommend for any Sonic fan.",,
BLUE HEDGEHOG GO BRRRRR,,
freaking epic,,
"The true evolution of 3D Sonic is finally here after decades, and it shows endless amounts of potential. Frontiers has some jank and kinks to work out with this new open world formula, but for a first attempt and considering all the risks taken, it paid off extremely well. A very well-thought out game giving you experiences that only Sonic can deliver.",,
"Here is a sonic game that actually plays to the strengths of its franchise. By that I mean its packed full of the elements that defined Sonic from the start along with some nifty additions that give a little bit of an open world element. It has a bit of stats and upgrades that you can unlock as you progress through the game and plenty of little things to collect and do in between.

True to the sonic franchise it also has a handful of levels that pose a very particular brand of challenge if you're looking to completely master each and every little stage as you go island hopping through the setting of Frontiers. It plays very much like the Dreamcast's Sonic Adventure titles in the respect you have stages and then an exploration mode. Though they really spiced it up in Frontiers by throwing baddies and other dangers into the open world portion.

Graphically I'd say its good for a Sonic game. Its made to play fast and it looks nice. Its probably the best looking of the sonic games to date if we're just talking graphics. That doesn't make it cutting edge with visuals by any means though. In fact its graphics for the most part wouldn't have been unheard of even a good 6 - 8 years back.

Sound has always been a major selling point for Sonic the Hedgehog. This game definitely plays it up with a diverse musical score that amounts to about 150 different musical pieces in the game that cover a range of genres. The very first major boss fight sets the musical tone for the following bosses and yes, the boss songs are all over youtube simply because it made those fights so memorable.

All in all I would highly recommend the game since it is long enough to give you a decent playtime. It takes around 20 - 25 hours to clear it on average. That depends though on how thorough you are about exploring and doing things versus just doing the barebones minimum to progress the story along. Although who wouldn't take their time to try out all the little things it has to offer? Don't let my playtime fool anyone. I saw latter parts of the game on console, so I do know how the story goes and how it ends. Here's to hoping they decide to make a follow-up game to this Frontiers because it could work if they put the effort in. They managed it back with Sonic Adventure 1 and 2 so I certainly could see it working here for at least a sequel. Its a nice thing when a finished game makes you look forward to the possibilities of a sequel after all.",,
"Is it best Sonic game ever made? No.

Is it the best Sonic game in the past 5 years? Yes

Playing Sonic Frontiers gave me hope in this franchise again since Forces buried into the ground again.

If you're looking for a Sonic game to sink plenty of hours into with good control and the best character writing in 13-14 years then by all means grab this whether it's on sale or not.

If this is the game formula we'll be getting for the foreseeable future, then I'm excited to see where they take it and refine it.",,
"Some of the best 3D Sonic in a long time and very refreshing after Forces was less than adequate. Some jank here and there with a couple of bugs that need to be patched, but overall this is a huge step in the right direction for Sonic as a whole. Hopefully Sega continues off this formula and improves everything drastically in either a sequel to this game or a whole different game with an improved version of this open zone formula.",,
Hello old friend. It's good to have you back.,,
add a feature where you can sex the big bots pls,,
"Played the game mainly on switch, but have had some time with the PC version on a friend's account, as well as a bit of time on my own. This game is really fun, but has some flaws. The challenges are extremely easy always, and that is kinda a bummer, and the collision is really janky at times, with sonic getting caught on various pieces of debris, the combat is a lot of fun but mechanics like the parry are OP as you can hold it out infinitely, the physics in cyberspace are also somewhat jarring, with boost having an effect on sonic's turning for near 2 seconds after you stop boosting, on top of the really long delay between homing attacks. The pop in and foliage render distance also needs an update of some sort, as there should be a way to turn foliage off and there should also be a way to extend distance far beyond what the game currently does, there is also the fact that a lot of the open world platforming design, while fun, is a bit too easy at the endgame on top of the platforms and stuff with the ancient themes not really fitting in the visual style of the islands themselves. Negatives aside though, this game is absolutely fantastic, a blast to play through, and a must play for any sonic fan, even if some things can be a little jarring or whatnot. This game is a blast for it's full runtime, even to 100% (which took me around 28 hours) and it is one that I will be coming to revisit in the future, I rank it 3rd on my personal list under Sonic Unleashed and S3&K. The mechanics in this game are a blast to mess around with, and I can't stress enough how fun this game is to control, even if the physics themselves are a bit flawed (I assume since they are based on what was done in Forces). This game for me is about an 8/10 and I recommend playing it!",,
Good soundtrack,,
"SQUID from Sonic Frontiers has changed my life. I used to be a low-tier beta male, but when i was saved by squid I became a SQUID male. I seriously recommend this game to people looking to better their lives.",,
"PROS:
The open world gameplay, bosses and music are absolutely amazing, fighting the first boss made me how i felt like as a kid playing Adventure 1&2 on the gamecube and hearing Open your heart and Live and learn for the first time. The music in this game goes so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hard and Sonic in the open world controls the best he has since Adventure 1&2 and the combat while simple is fun. Also play on hard mode if you want the true ending.

CONS:
Cyberspace on the other hand is the worst part of this game (sans the music it's gud) it controls like absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and is a ugly stain on a otherwise really fun game. I'm not even super upset at the reused level design (yes its lazy as all hell no excuses) but Sonic controls completely different and is honestly the worst Sonic has ever controlled! If Sonic Team is going to continue to make linear boost stages they should go back to Unleashed and Generations level design, preferably with the length of Unleashes day stages and have Sonic control like he did in Unleashed or Generations.

No momentum that is all.

Also It definitely seems that Sonic Team ran out of time or money because the last two island are basically just parts of island 1 with island 4 being straight up a part of island 1 just blocked off by invisible barriers (the first boss literally takes place on a part of island 4) and I've heard island 5 was originally part of island 1. This makes sense since island 1 is the smallest island in the game.



I know for a lot of people it may seem like I'm saying the cons outweigh the pros and for some people they may, but for me personally they don't. Given that you really only have to play two stages of cyberspace and island 4 and 5 while repetitive are still fun to run around and fight in and momentum can be added with a mod (I'm not giving points for that though because its a mod) and makes the game even more fun.

My personal score for Sonic Frontiers is 7.5/10
The music is a 10/10 though",,
Sonic,,
Very good,,
"literally the game I've wanted since a kid, an open world sonic game. the fact that it's a good sonic game for once too makes it even better. flawless story, fun and initiative gameplay and stunning graphics. highly recommend.",,
"I haven't played a new mainline Sonic game in probably at least a decade (mainly played the GameCube games, especially Adventure 2), but I still check in with the franchise every so often to listen to the music and see if things are any good. I was desperately hoping for this game to be good while waiting for it to release and was thankfully not disappointed!

I don't have any experience with the boost games, but this game was pretty easy to learn. The controls aren't perfect (specifically with the cyberspace levels), but it feels satisfying to run around the open world areas and get S ranks after a few tries. There are obvious pop-in problems that have already been mentioned plenty of times. I'm not sure if anyone else has this issue, but I got very annoyed with getting forced into parts of the map when trying to go somewhere - I would accidentally run into a boost pad or spring and I would be forced to follow along with the camera, which got annoying after a while. Near the end of the game I started avoiding the rails and such altogether as long as I had enough collectibles. Aside from that, I think the maps are nice and have lots of potential for refinement in future games.

Highlights of this game for me are definitely the , , and the . The soundtrack is incredible and has so much variety; it fits in perfectly along with the other amazing Sonic OSTs. The boss fights are incredibly fun and fresh with the vocal tracks making them even better. I LOVED the character interactions. Sonic's interactions with his friends in particular remind me of the Adventure games in the best ways possible. As a side note, the story cutscenes have nice animations/facial expressions too that haven't really been in the newer titles. Sage is a great addition to the franchise and I hope she appears again in the future. The references to older games are wonderful and I have no idea why the previous writers were so afraid of mentioning previous games in the franchise. Unfortunately, I do think the story starts to fall apart in the end. I'm not sure if the game ended up rushed or Flynn had restrictions from SEGA, but it seems like they weren't able to fully commit to what they wanted to do. It's far from bad compared to the stories from more recent Sonic games (Forces, Lost World, etc.), but I was left disappointed at a few moments.

Overall, I absolutely recommend this game to anyone with even a passing interest in Sonic. Whether you've only seen the movies, haven't played a Sonic game in decades or play every new release, I think there's something here for everyone. You might be hard pressed to try this game if you don't care for Sonic and have played other open-world games, but I'd still give it a shot on sale if so. Sonic's future seems very bright right now and I can't wait to see what we get next.",,

But it has an easy to pick up and engaging gameplay, an amazing soundtrack, great boss battles, and a good quality story that's putting the building blocks down for a single, coherent continuity while pushing the narrative forward.

"It took them 10 years for them to make a Sonic game that could be praised worldwide, I don't count Sonic Mania since Sonic Team didn't make it. This is a Giganto step in the right direction, especially since the last Sonic game I played was Lost World. I do have a few issues like the Cyber Space levels being very reused from games like Generations and they do try to sugarcoat it by saying it's based on Sonic's memories but that's not a good excuse for reused level design. It's a fairly minor complaint since the levels are optional thanks to Big's fishing.",,

Sonic Frontiers 100% Review

This is one of if not the best sonic game I have ever played in recent years. Always been a fan of sonic but fans tend to do things a little better then Sega, but this time it seems Sega is doing great things with sonic. Now keep in mind most people are saying this isn't the greatest, but I'm looking at this game for the future, and if they keep this kind of game play going forward and story telling, ill be very excited for the next game coming out.

With that said I was able to 100% this game in a single run on the hardest difficulty, and even then the game didn't feel ""Hard"" just need to punch things a little more since mobs have more HP. Everything plays the exact same way just how tough do you want your enemies to be when it comes to difficulty, with that said though there is a secret final boss if you play on the hardest difficulty, and it was a very hard fight.

The boss battles and music is top notch and cant stop listening to it on you tube when I'm playing other games. The game play on the over world maps as least to me don't feel dull either, I wouldn't play this a 2nd time around for 100% but on my first go I scouted the map looking and getting everything on the map for me to get and collect.

With all this said, I did get this for free from a friend who knew I liked sonic, but I do this thing where I wait for a sale to get a sonic game before I buy, play, and review, This game even though its one of the best I've played, I personally would still wait for a sale on this one. a $50 or $60 game to be 100% done in 26hrs to me at least isn't worth the price. My mato on games is I should spend 1hr for every $1 i spent, i was hoping this game would have about 50hrs of play for me but I found out it didn't, which is why I usually wait for sales, cause sonic games are a great price on sale for how quickly they can be played and beat, but fresh off release, might wanna wait on this one.

With all that said, play this game, its up to you if you feel the price is right, or wanna avoid spoilers and get it for yourself. If you like sonic, sonic lore, game play, and want to exp this new combat system that works very well and feels sonic, give this a go and enjoy the ride!",,
"Review
As a longtime Sonic fan who has loved the 1990s and 2000s Sonic games, Sonic Frontiers for me was a long time coming.

Gameplay
Gameplay-wise, Sonic to me hasn't controlled this well since the Adventure games (in the open-zone levels at least). He does not feel like a car as he had been in previous games, moving sluggishly unless when performing specific actions- he can change speed and direction much more fluidly this time around. Sonic’s speed might feel a bit slower when compared to Sonic Generations or Sonic Unleashed, but it is easy to get used to and even be ignored somewhat when Sonic is at his maximum speed (when he carrying the maximum number of rings possible). Alongside this, there are a lot of combat moves that Sonic can unlock, making approaches to enemy encounters more varied- you can just use homing attack if you want to, but I feel that you will be limiting yourself by doing so.

With regards to the cyberspace levels, while they can be a bit of a disappointment for some due to their repetitive level theming, shorter length, and worse controls (when compared to the 3D games that came before), I was able to enjoy the nice bite-sized levels for what they were. It was fun finding which bits and pieces of the level design came from older Sonic games (not all of them are just copy and pastes however). There are a lot more paths to take to get to the end of a level and the ranking system makes it much harder to get an S rank as well- especially when compared to .

Story and Character-wise, Sonic hasn't been this good since , , and (the games, in my opinion, that have the best stories and portrayal of Sonic’s character). Sonic here is cool, confident, and cares about his friends. He is cocky, but is not a jerk. I loved seeing Sonic's interactions with his friends as it shows that they, well - they are people that he values and not ones that he ignores/undervalues in order to crack a joke. The story returns to a more shonen-like nature similar to that of the 2000s games- being serious, without being too over the top, something that I really enjoyed as well.

It's not perfect my mind you- Roger's new vocal tone can be a bit awkward to get use to at first, Sonic doesn't seem to have as much as an emotional range as during the Storybook games or (at this point in the story at least), there can be awkward pauses both dialogue and animation wise- but it is a step in the right direction.

I hope that this game gets nominated for Best Soundtrack at this year's Steam Awards, especially after getting snubbed at the Game Awards this year.
The fact that this game has is crazy enough, let alone them also being high quality as well!

Tomoya Ohtani and his team have knocked it out the park with the OST for this game, not only creating a unique theme for each of the (30!) cyberspace levels, but also vocal tracks for each boss, the opening theme, and multiple credit themes!

I didn't think that metal would work in a Sonic game, but Undefeatable proved me wrong!

Tomoya Ohtani's electronic style has improved drastically as well. While I did not mind soundtrack, one issue that plagued the music for me was the lack of variety with regards to instruments. Since every level took place in Eggman’s fortress/areas controlled by him, every song used the same synth noise used for Eggman levels since - making every electronic song, while good in its instrumentation, sound the same.

In however, there is a lot more variety in the synths used for the cyberspace tracks making each song feel unique from each other (something further helped by the using of bass, drums, piano, record scratching/sampling, etc). Alongside this, there are a lot more different styles this time around, ranging from Electronic to Drum & Bass. Some of my favorite tracks include 1-1, 1-5, 1-6, 2-4, 2-5, and 4-3.

I loved the subtle overworld themes for how they elevate the atmosphere of the game. Running around the open areas as Sonic, watching the sun passing by, all with the soft notes of a piano and violin in the background...- it creates this slightly melancholy feel of exploring a world gone by that’s just so well done.

While not perfect, 's story, combat, gameplay, and OST are way too good for me to not enjoy the game. As a Sonic fan, I'd give this game (so far) a 7-8/10.

If you are a Sonic fan, I'd definitely say to pick this one up when you have the chance. If you are the average gamer, your mileage may vary- I would still say to try the game, but to buy it on sale or full price is up to you.

Here's to hoping that Sonic Team builds upon this excellent base that they have to make their next game even greater!

"As far as sonic games go this is one of the best which isn't saying much but is a huge statement at the same time. Sonic frontiers isn't perfect but, as many people have been saying, is a great step in the right direction. Gameplay is a mix on new and old with the new being incredible and the old, while not necessarily being bad, is more or less recycled from past games like forces, generations, and unleashed. Long story short, the good stuff include the open world, the fights, the character interaction, and the story to an extent. The bad would be the fact that the game doesn't feel polished and there are a few technical issues here and there that definitely need addressing. The cyberspace levels were a little fun but they feel less like generations and unleashed's boost levels and more like sonic forces making them a bit tedious and pretty janky. Overall the game deserves at least an 8.5/10 and sonic and non-sonic fans should definitely play this one!",,
Keep the formula cause its working so far.,,

"This game has been the best sonic game for so long, and i absolute love it <3",,
"Not the masterpiece or revolutionary game that most of Sonic fans says, but a good game. I recovered my faith in Sonic Team, they can make a good game if you bully them for 5 years after their horrible last game.",,
"What a breath of fresh air this game is. The freedom to just run around an open playground combined with a frantic fighting system makes this game one of my favorite new entries in the Sonic franchise. And as a long time Sonic fan, I'm glad we are changing the formula a bit.

Monster designs are new, different, but not off-putting. Story content is pretty strong, stronger than I was expecting and elicited way more emotion from me than I was expecting to give. The ride was a fun one. The music was exactly what I wanted from a Sonic game and the whole package was stable and playable.

If this is the new foundation of Sonic games, I say bring it on.",,
I like it,,

Very fun game. Wish you could replay the titan fights on their own.,,
Greatest game ive played in my life,,

"Best Sonic game in a long time and i mean a very long time. Still cringe at times but you gotta expect that with sonic. i actually wanted more by the end of the game. speaking of the end, the ending was a little lackluster so it definitely gets an 8/10 for me.",,
"fast

this is a good game, not a great one. I think it's a great proof of concept that this style of game can work, but there are a lot of half-baked systems and choices that feel like they were made because of either laziness or a lack of time

/fast",,
"A banger of a game, nostalgia heaven for any and all Sonic nerds, music slaps and the environment is perfect. Sonic's overall control can be changed to your preference, and the game itself throws some curve balls here and there with the Cyber Space levels. Story was pretty decent as well, better than most Sonic games in the past decade. A solid 8.5/10!",,
"A game in the Sonic Franchise and it's good again! We've had to wait a while for it but here it is.

A story that takes itself more seriously, a good controlling Sonic and well written characters! This one got it all.

Fun open area game that does not overstay it's welcome!",,
"I wanted to believe in this game so I did the rare thing and pre-ordered... and I'm glad because this game rocks.

Traversing and exploring the Islands is pretty fun: Sonic moves relatively fast and that speed can be enhanced (more on that later) and the way new connecting rails appear when you clear some of the puzzles make the map traversal quick if you haven't unlocked the fast travel options while still being cool looking with some loops, spins, jumps and neat camera angles. It's pure distraction from the fact you're just grinding a rail from point A to point B, but it's a welcomed one anyway.

The islands have a lot to offer and I really enjoyed getting all memory tokens from each islands: they're all some sort of mini levels within the big level that is the Island and I'm glad that it's not required to get them all to progress, you can simply do all those you come across while naturally traversing the Island and you'll have enough of them. Overall I find it awesome to be able to speed around the Islands and still find things to do. Whenever I was near a Memory Token I didn't have yet, I was kind of a kid watching a magician, wondering what the next cool trick would be this time.

Talking about levels, the Cyber-Space is pretty fun, although the they are not equals in quality, some are memorable because of the challenge for the S-Rank (looking at you 1-2) or simply because they were a lot of fun, with alternate pathing that change the way you go through them. Some of them though, you can get all the side goals of time, rings and red rings in 2 runs for most of them, sometimes you might get everything on your first try and not have much reason to do them again. None of them were really BAD though so that's awesome.

I like that there is a cannon explanation as to why areas from previous games show up too, it's a neat detail.

In terms of Combat, sonic gets to use a lot of different moves and you can have fun building your own combos, or use the Auto-Combo option if you're not too sure about it. Not sure how it looks because I disabled Auto-Combo but it's nice that it exists.
Unlocking new skills come from using EXP points you get from doing various activities sur as beating ennemies breaking hidden boxes or doing air tricks after certain jumps (again, more on that later).

Before I forget to put it anywhere, the soundtrack is a banger, I can't remember any time where I disliked the music. And the Titans fight musics are SICK.

In terms of Story, the plot is honestly kind of bland. However what was really cool was to see all fo the Character moments; Amy is no longer the clingy annoying fangirl I remember her as; Knux appears more mature and collected than before and Tails... I won't spoil it. Overall every Character, Sonic included, seemed to have aknowledged their shortcomings in the last bunch of 3D Sonic games and are working on it, which is really nice.

Now, is this game a Masterpiece? No, here's why, but note that what I'm about to say means in no way that the game isn't good. The game is awesome and I had tons of fun playing through it.

- The game is pretty short. At 34 hours, I have finished the game at 100% completion and most of the final hours were running around the Islands fighting Guardiands to get the final achievement of 50 Phantom Rushes. I feel like for a price tag such as it is now, it's kind of rough. Maybe it's the image of the Blue Blur himself: too fast.

- Sonic's controls, especially in Cyberspace can be somewhat unreliable, and while a Mod fixes a lot fo these issues, it must be noted that it required a mod to make things better, hopefully a patch helps in that regard. It's not unbearable though, simply that it differs a bit from the free roam movement that Sonic has on the Islands.

- I mentionned before that Sonic's abilities and stats can be improved but it's not all sunshines and rainbows.
Increasing your Attack damage makes ennemies fall way too quickly, reaching high levels of damage make even the Bosses and Mini-bosses a Trivial matter. The third island's Boss, the Knight, was over in less than 2 minutes and ennemies in general die way too quickly meaning that most of the cool abilities you unlock are mostly for show and only useful against tough ennemies such as big Guardians and Titans.

Defence upgrade reduces the ammount of Ring you lose when taking a hit which is still pretty useful but both stats are increased at the same time when speaking to the Hermit, meaning you can't upgrade just your defence while keeping low damage to make longer combos.

- Also, the EXP gains is kind of weird, I had unlocked all the abilities (with Auto Combo being the last one I went for) by the end of the Second Island (out of 5) and now I'm sitting on like 500 skills points that have no purpose because I already have everything.

You can also upgrade your speed and max ring capacity by speaking to the Elder but the process is SO. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. SLOW. Again, there is a mod that makes this process a lot faster but needing a mod not to go insane when doing something basic like an upgrade is just wrong. They could have simply added a sub menu asking how many levels you wanted increased, with maybe the choice of like 1 level, 5 levels, 10 levels or As much as possible.
Instead you have to level up 1 level per 1 level and get both stats to level 99, without the Mod, I'd probably have fallen asleep.

-Coming back to ennemies, they kind of lack in variety and most of them are either completely harmless or just kind of Annoying to deal with, which is a problem because you don't even meet a lot of ennemies as you explore the Islands so when you do get into fights, it either ends way too quickly or it simply isn't very fun. The birds in the third Island on the weird umbrela thing in the Desert are good example of this.

- It's currently impossible to battle the Titan Bosses again, even in the Arcade mode you unlock after beating the game which is a shame.


Still, while Sonic Frontiers is not a masterpice, it is most definitely a good game overall and somewhat of a must-buy if you're a Sonic Fan",,
This is already in contention for the best Sonic game of all time.,,
The best 3D sonic game excluding adventures.,,

go buy it on a sale if you hate $60 dollar games... let alone $70.",,
"As a sonic fan i have to say this is by far the best Sonic the hedgehog game I've played in a long time. Sonic Team is definitely heading towards the right direction. Keep up the good work.

An Experience I will never forget.,,
"Great game, a little jank but not enough to take me out of the experience. 8/10 looking forward to seeing where they take this new formula next",,
Sonic Frontiers my beloved,,
sonic the hedgehog,,
"Good games, needs more content maybe

Edit: Oh my god they added more content",,
Sonic Frontiers is easily a great step in the right direction for modern Sonic. Whilst some things weren’t perfected I still massively appreciate the time and effort that went into this game. The best part of the game is definitely the sound track. Meanwhile some parts of the gameplay haven’t had the best attention given to it. Some things feel somewhat developed but not all much improved on but it doesn’t take away enough from the overall package that I could say it’s a bad game. This game was easily worth the £40 I spent on it and with the 35 hours I played to 100% (and messing around with character mods),,
"I honestly wasn't expecting to like this one,but here we are,so here's the rundown;

Island Exploring
I actually had fun explorin the Islands,the feeling of moving around these huge landscapes with such high speed I'd expect to see from the Blue Blur is a sight to behold
The collectables weren't that bad to find, as in there's a plethora of ways to obtain them
Although the last two islands could've been handled a lot better in my opinion,

Combat Experience Part 1: Regular Enemies
The combat is no way complex like other famous action games such as Devil May Cry and the like,but it gets the job done for what it is,
You have a few ways to end your combos with a mix of long-ranged options thrown in,
The Parry is cool,but I wished it had a tigher window to pull off to really make it rewarding to pull off

Combat Experience Part 2: Titan Showdowns
The Titan Bosses are an absolute marvel in terms of spectacle and they're also a good showcase of how just powerful Super Sonic really is in a way we haven't seen in a Sonic game before
The themes accompanying these battles are a joy to listen to,as they remind me of the good old days that I was listening to other fantastic songs through out the series
.

When I heard Ian Flynn was going to be writing the story to this game,I was very pleased.
His experience of writing the stories of the comics and the charcters really shows here,as this game's story is very solid with references for the fans that have invested a lot of time in this franchise,
It's not perfect mind you,but it's tons better than in the past games.

The Cyber Space Stages are the low points of the experience for me as in the controls in these is very inconsistent about if you have a speed cap or not,but they're not a big part of this game so they don't bother me that much.

So all in all,I enjoyed my time with this one.
If this is the future of the next games moving forward, I hope that this style can flourish gracefully and bring new exciting things to the franchise.",,
I love this game with all my heart but jesus christ what happened with the final boss????,,
By far the best Sonic Game since Sonic Generations. Wish it played more like Generations in the Level sections but I appreciate this game a lot,,
"I really hope Sonic Team keeps improving on this formula. Sonic Frontiers is an absolute blast, and if they polish this formula a bit more, I think it'd be an amazing fit for the future of Sonic.",,
"Played up to the 3rd island on Switch so far. Dunno how they've done it, but the bosses are actually amazing. Every boss is like a final boss.

Also the first fight is cinematic af. Inject that ♥♥♥♥ into my veins.",,
Sonic go fast. 10/10.,,
"Having never played any Sonic before this, I thought it definitely had some problems and aspects in which the lack of budget or time was apparent, but I had a lot of fun. Not a perfect game by a long shot, but a good one.",,
"movement is ok, i guess
some levels are sonic forces level of short and have weirdly cutthroat S-rank times (1-2)
combat is awesome, wish it was more balanced though
levelling system is a good idea, although levelling them one at a time isn't
the story exists
the music is good, especially bosses
cutscenes and scripted events are recorded in 30 fps, which is weird when you're playing in 60

overall, pretty good.",,
"Sonic Frontiers has easily become one of my favorite games in the Sonic series. My first thought regarding the game's quality is that the soundtrack is undeniably incredible. So much so, I feel that some of the Cyber Space stages don't do it justice since some of them end rather quickly. Though the game is not perfect, I hope genuine Sonic fans can unanimously agree that Sonic Frontiers is a step toward a better future for the Sonic series. I 100% recommend anyone who hasn't played this game to start and end on hard, it's much more engaging and fun to play this way. As a long time Sonic fan since childhood, I'm also happy to see that the relationships between Sonic and the gang feel more like genuine connections with character growth instead of stagnant characters.

The only few things I disliked are mostly the quality of cutscenes, the lack of physical expressiveness in dialogue scenes, and the fact that I wish the game could be just a bit more difficult. Although there's a recurring criticism saying the game feels repetitive (and in honesty it is), I personally felt like this did not make the game tedious or boring in any capacity. Since I was so curious and engaged by the story the repetition was something that didn't bother me at all. Some people also criticize the game's appearance and say they'll never play this game simply because it has realistic grass and trees. These people eat glue.

Overall I'd say this game is a solid 8.5/10, great and definitely worth picking up.",,
"I love the new fighting style, skill tree, voice acting, tone, and overall the direction they went with this game. I haven't felt this hyped over a sonic game in YEARS. and the music is just perfect. Definitely needs some fixes here and there but overall such a great game. It's got me excited for the future games to come.",,
This game's soundtrack alone justified the purchase for me. Especially the tracks that played during boss fights. Some of the most fun I've ever had as Super Sonic period!,,
"The best sonic game in 10 years, no competition.",,
Jogo ta lindo demais.,,
"Good game, but far too easy even on the hardest difficulty.
I'd recommend installing the Insane Difficulty mod by The Duck Dealer to make it harder.

With their mod, countering requires timing instead of just holding the button until an attack comes, and sonic doesn't do as much damage, which means open-world fights are actually fights and not 1-shots and Guardians aren't killed in 1 combo.

As for the rest of the game: the music is good, the game establishes a lot of canon, the character writing is back to a gold standard, movement and exploration is fun.
A few stages have similar design to SA2 stages but with different aesthetics, which is great because those levels are some of the best-designed in 3D Sonic.
This game is a real return for Sonic...just a shame that the final boss is literally a top-down shoot-em-up.

Still, haven't enjoyed a Sonic game like this in years",,
"Pleasantly surprised with this game.

Gameplay is fun 90% of the time, controls well and the music slaps as Sonic music tends to.

There are a couple of awkward shifts in gameplay that feel like entirely different games, but they are few and far between.

The characters seem way more fleshed out in this game and less one dimensional. The story follows suite also being one of, if not the best ever seen in a Sonic game. Ian Flynn was a great choice for the writing team and I hope he sticks around.

There are bugs and the game isn’t perfect by any means, but if you like some of the previous boost games like unleashed, colours or generations chances are you will have lots of fun with this one.",,
"By no means perfect, but a step in the right direction for the Devil May Cry franchise.",,
Best sonic game in a while,,
"This is the perfect 3D formula for modern Sonic going forward. Yes there are some issues like the pop-in and the camera control gets taken away from you a little too often but what is presented here is a great foundation for future 3D Sonic games. A more serious story and tone that starts to incorporate lore from other games and the comics and such, a beautiful visual style and open zone areas for you to run around in and of course the best music ever. You're in for a real treat especially hitting the boss fights in each area which was insanely epic. Frontiers is a good buy.",,
"I waited until I completed the game before submitting a review. I was optimistic before release, ignoring the usual negativity that surrounds the release of any Sonic game these days. I'd been keeping up to date on trailers but stayed away from any spoilers. I honestly loved every minute of the game. I enjoyed the variety of parkour style challenges dotted about to get memory tokens or defence/attack upgrades, I liked hunting for Koco when I could hear them, I enjoyed just looking at the open world and the beautiful details and ambience and I loved the Cyber Space sections which break game play up.
Additionally, the bosses (mini and main) are all so cinematic and fun to fight. And the music, is amazing! I also like how it's very accessible for people who may not be the best at action games and has tips if you want to use them (though to get the true ending, you need to complete on Hard and that was...different, but I still had fun).
I liked the small puzzles, though a lot were very easy to complete, even on Normal. Also the difficulty of the Cyber Space levels varied, which I liked as I found myself working very hard on some to get all 4 missions and on several occasions I couldn't do them all, which was fine, because it's not fun to breeze through everything, so I feel that was spot on.
There are a few things which bothered me. When levelling up Attack and Defence, Hermit Koco will take all the Seeds you found and level you up accordingly. Elder Koco though will ask you each time if you want speed or ring capacity. It took me 20 minutes to get to Max from 40 something each after I bought a ton of Koco from fishing (is that even legal, poor guys). I would be better if the Elder told you how much you could get and have a couple of sliders or similar to choose, say, 5 levels of Speed increased and 10 Ring capacity, or whatever you wanted.
Skill points are way to easy to get, I unlocked all the moves and by end game had over 500 just...there, I was maxed out. And I wasn't killing everything on sight either, quite often ignoring smaller enemies or repeating bosses in favour or exploring more.
The controls on the climbable walls feels a little off, I will press right and Sonic will go down, a few times I climbed slow rather than running due to falling off parkour or such.
Tracking when locked on doesn't seem to hold the camera to the enemy particularly well. I found myself hitting R3 a few times only to realise it was locked on, but I was still having trouble keeping my target in sight well.
The camera bounces a little too much in areas which are a little bumpy. Sonic was going over cobbles and the camera was really jerky trying to maintain its position to the model.
But, no other glitches, physics were way better than [previous titles and I had only a few launches across parts of the map after accidentally running over rocks, but I got some great air!
Overall, I'd like to see more open world adventures, but I wonder how long the team can maintain reusing old zone environments in a hope to capture what made Generations such a hit. Though the Cyber Space thing worked well and tied into the story perfectly, there are only so many times that this format can be used. Don't get me wrong, I loved those sections, but perhaps making those zones open world or just make new zones, though that's normally when things go wrong and it's so hard to tell what fans want, when half the time what they want is nostalgia (I get it, I'm an 80s kid). But it makes me worry for the future of the series.
I'm glad I bought it day one and got to play it as soon as possible, I took my time, enjoyed the world and I'm kind of sad to complete it, but well done guys, you dared to try something new and I hope it gives you courage to keep moving forward. Thank you for the amazing experience.",,

The colony was completely shut down, probably to prevent the prototype from falling into the wrong hands.

The ARK was shut down under the premise that there had been an accident. I found Maria's name among those who died when the ARK was shut down. She meant everything to me! And I couldn't bear the thought that she died because of my research. I lost everything! I had nothing more to live for! I went insane!! All I could think about, was to avenge her! Somehow, someway, I got scared as I no longer was able to control my thoughts. All I could think about, was that I wanted it all to end. Based on my original projections, I was able to complete my project; Shadow. I designed its mind to be perfect, pure... I will leave everything, to him. If you wish, release and awaken it to the world..

All of you ungrateful humans, who took everything away from me, will feel my loss and despair!

"Amazing sound track with beautiful open world's to explore with so much stuff to do, this game isn't just like other sonic games it has more of a sonic unleashed kind of feel to it but without the werehog.
To defeat enemies you have to use combo attacks and upgrade your skills in a skill tree witch is very easy to do.
The game it self has a very unique story that doesn't feel forced like some other sonic games.
the only thing that bothered me at first was the cutscenes wasn't in full-screen i got over it after a while in tho.

I recommend this game to people that want to get into sonic or that are looking for a nice change of pace from other games. This is all just my opinions tho so.",,

Hello fello Sonic fans and new fans!

I've been a long time fan since I first played mega collection for GameCube back it 2004. I've played most if not all the games and have beaten atleast 6 or 7 including this one. I gave up on Sonic after Boom and only observed the series til forces. Forces is a god awful travesty that made me give up on Sonic entirely. I recently got into the comics after hearing they were very good. Once I heard Ian Flynn was directing the story I had a lot of hope. All the hope and waiting was so worth it.

If you gave up on Sonic this is the game to bring you back into it and brought Sonic back (hopefully for the good.) The story is great and the characters are better than ever. Before you go in thinking Shadow or anyone post Adventure era's here; they are not. It was a breath of fresh air to see the original four only in this game.

I cannot recommend this game enough it's a 9.5/10 and I consider it better than SA2. I know I know that's a big statement and I am ready for the flak. Anyway PLEASE BUY THIS GAME or get it on sale its a fantastic game.",,

"It's not a typical Sonic game, but god is it fun and the music is so good

8.5/10 I hated the final boss",,
"While it has a lot of minor inconveniences (had to reset because it soft locked once when Sonic was stuck in level geometry during a side-scrolling sections) this is the freshest Sonic's felt in a long time and the game where he controls the best. It's a 7.5/10 that feels like a 10/10 because of its ambition and that's what matters most to me.

Also the first boss alone dunks on every final boss we've had in the past 14 years.",,
"OVERALL RATING: 8/10

TL:DR - Welcome back Sonic fans, the blue blur returns in stunning fashion.

INTRO:
Sonic Frontiers is far from a perfect game in my eyes but is the strongest mainline entry to the series in a long time. It is proof to fans who have been waiting patiently that 3D Sonic games still have a future, and if Frontiers is any indication that future is bright. In many ways this game is a love letter to all sonic fans with the many call backs to older games, shows, comics, and more. It brings several things into the canon that had all been in question before and while the actual nature of the how the world is put together is still vague it is pleasing to know that the writers care and are making an attempt to bring everything together.

STORY:
Frontier's story specifically dealing with Sage and the Ancients was told in a way that I am not a huge fan of where you are given bite sized cutscenes that you have to search for on each island to piece together what is going on. It fits well enough into the game but just felt awkward to me at first. Luckily as I progressed, the plot also felt more and more part of the game and less like a random occurrence. Overall it was pleasing and gave us some character depth lacking in most other Sonic titles. Sage was ultimately an enjoyable character and the story of the ancients opened up the lore of Sonic's world in a way I doubt anyone expected.

GAMEPLAY:
As for gameplay, this is arguably the most I have enjoyed a ""modern"" Sonic's gameplay. Meaning games since Sonic 06 where boost gameplay was largely introduced. I felt Frontiers really honed in on the controls and the feel of Sonic and made everything feel fast, intuitive, and fun. There are times where Sonic's speed or the physics of the game causes issues but for the most part I couldn't complain. The Cyberspace levels were all a blast to play and offered an exciting break between exploring the islands. The difficulty of these levels ranged a lot from brain dead to nearly requiring perfect play to S-Rank. Last but not least the open world gameplay was definitely repetitive but it was assuredly fun, full speed sprinting across the islands, boosting through loops, jumps, grinds, and everything in between as you explore, it was all exciting and for a game of Frontier's length, the repetitiveness never got to me as I blasted across the game world. The cherry on top would definitely be Sonic's new DMC-esque combat abilities which made fighting bosses a new, exciting, but welcome addition to Sonic's standard gameplay.

ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS:
-Fishing is completely overpowered for completionists in this game as it allows you to get nearly every collectible not just easily, but quickly as well.

-The music overall is top notch and meets the standards of what long time Sonic fans would expect.

-Being forced to level up your Speed/Ring levels one at a time is completely absurd and painful on one's thumbs.

-Having puzzles that require it to be night time but also having no ""Pass Time"" feature feels really bad.",,
"After finishing the game, I can tell that it is the best Sonic game released in the last decade. Ian Flynn killed it with the story. Sonic, Amy, Tails and Knuckles felt like they were themselves. (I liked a lot Sonic and Tails interactions). They did a good job introducing Sage, especially at the ending, poor Eggman. I haven't felt bad for a sonic character ever since Chip. The best score I can give the game is a 7/10, its good, but it has issues. I have 3 things I want from Frontiers:
- Add a Boss Rush, the bosses were amazing.
- Release the Soundtrack.
- This is a really good foundation for future Sonic games.
Should you buy the game? If you like Sonic, then yes get it, its worth it. If you are hesitant, then wait for a discount, then you got yourself a really good deal.

All that matters is, FRONTIERS IS A GOOD GAME",,

good game my friend gifted this to me thanks jake i like it very much its better than sonic forces good job sega you get a thumbs up from me",,
"Gameplay
The game-play for Sonic Frontiers has incredibly fun player mechanics; Sonic is able to boost, jump, spin dash, and stomp as in most of his 3D games and these mechanics come back very polished in this game (for the most part). The only issue is that Sonic moves far too slow in this game as a compromise for the cyberspace levels and open world in order to not have him zip everywhere, which can tank on actually moving around the open world or searching for fast-paced level game-play. The boosting is somewhat unsatisfying as the speed boost it gives is necessary for Sonic's momentum and yet feels slow. The new jumping spindash, added from Sonic Mania, is a fun tool to use in concept, except that is is largely ineffective at keeping sonic's momentum so it becomes very niche in usage. The actual levels/zones used in the game range from being great to absolutely boring. The zones in the game offer pretty good platforming challenges but there isn't a reward ample for beating them, so they largely go ignored. The platforming usually never improves upon Sonic's core game-play skills so after about 5 levels of cyberspace and the first zone the game-play becomes samey, which isn't bad but it's not great either. Most settings for Sonic in the game are usually big cinematic set-pieces rather than a game-play piece to really flex out Sonic's movement, which is most apparent during boss fights that boil down to parrying to win. The parry mechanic does not need timing; rather it functions as an OP block, and it trivializes most boss fights. Again, not a bad thing but it bottlenecks the game from being great. There is a level up system which is fine and fairly balanced but is not explained to well (in terms of what speed and ring capacity actually do) and suffer the same problem as Dark Souls 2 where the stats aren't defined so the player has a rough way of actually curating a ""build."" There is also a fishing minigame that is quite relaxing but will tear the game's difficulty down significantly due to the rewards it gives. There are some cool hidden mechanics like homing attack cancels and rail launching but these don't push the game too in depth, which is good since it's easy for newcomers to learn.

There isn't too much story to the game overall, but the plot is good. The premise of Sonic and Co. exploring the starfall islands, learning about their history, and trying to find ways to beat the big baddie were enjoyable, but not much to write home about. The character arcs that the cast goes through are short and sweet, it's mainly the cast discovering their self-worth in some fashion.


Overall the story is short but sweet, nothing too ambitious but probably the best story in any Sonic game.

The graphics for this game look a bit rough around the edges but are passable. The only issue is that most of the areas feel very similar to one another due to constantly using the same obstacle designs and due to their being no dedicated environmental hazards to separate stages/zones from one another. The open world areas while impressive in structure lack any real depth, and most of the cyberspace levels look like classic sonic games but are repetitive to look at.

The music for this game is incredible with EDM for cyberspace stages, lofi for fishing, great ambiance for the zones and some of the best boss music compositions for any game in general. All music really fits its scene and environment well and enhances the playing experience.

Overall I'd say this is a good game overall with a few gameplay issues due to stage and level design. There are some balance problems but they don't distract from the experience. The game looks a little rough but the music covers for that.",,
"I can't believe I'm saying this, but this series might just be going towards the path of redemption! While this game isn't perfect, it's definetly a step in the right direction:
- The ""open zone"" formula fits Sonic like a glove
- The first 3 Islands are a joy to explore
- The system doesn't get old
- The soundtrack is one of the best yet and if this game doesn't win something soundtrack related during the game awards, I'm throwing a tantrum.
- The Titan fights are PEAK 3D SONIC
- The combat system is pretty flashy
- The controls are great
- You can tweak Sonic's speed and controls
- It doesn't function like garbage on a keyboard
- You can draw ****s with the new cyloop ability
- The environment looks gorgeus
- The characterization is epic
- The animation ROCKS
- The models and fur textures look great
- The voice acting is a big step up (altough Roger does sometimes sound really unnatural)
- Big finally makes his redemption with a chill fishing minigame, where you can skip most of the minibosses or cyberspace levels or collecting memory tokens, and you can even get these egg memmos which are voice messages from eggman
- the modding community ALREADY started modding

And now for the flaws:
- Both the story and gameplay begins a MASSIVE decline towards the 4th island
- The final boss is stupid easy for some reason (not the true one)
- The FINAL FINAL boss is a quick time event
- Elder Koco should be stomped on by Giganto
- The true final boss is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hacking minigame
- the minigames are trash
- Even though Ian Flynn FINALLY got the chance to write for a mainline title, it feels as though SEGA is holding him back, as seen near the finale
- The platforming challanges feel really out of place, they should look more natural
- Cyberspace on paper is an AMAZING idea, but it's executed, like crap. There are only a mere FOUR level themes, none of them are new, which is just lazy, the controls feel awful here for some reason, and all the challanges are extremely easy to complete.

All in all, I don't think it's a perfect game, but the formula is definetly great and they should stick with it.

Everyone's underselling this game. This is the best game I've played in a while. It is my favorite Sonic game ever. A Sonic Frontiers 2 would be the best game ever made.,,
sonic front clears!!!!!,,
Its fun,,
"I sold half of my steam inventory just to buy this game.
Was it worth it?
HELL YES!",,
"there are some issues here and there hopefully they patch em , best sonic game after so many years graphically and gameplay wise",,
Sonic but with Metal Gear Rising Boss fights and music,,
"To Start this Review, I want to say this Game Blew Me Away. In my opinion this the best Sonic Game to come out in such a long time. The Game play is Perfect, The Music is fantastic(especially the Titan fights). I think the Story is a lot better this time around. it felt more serious(Something Sonic Forces fell flat on(Again: My Opinion) The Combat is Phenomenal and the attacks are fun to pull off. It was also Great Hearing all the different References from Sonic's history. This is a Sonic game I highly Recommend picking it up. I played and finished the game on Both the Nintendo Switch and PC(100%) on Hard Mode",,
"This game overall was a blast to play!

It took me 22 hours to do everything, which makes sense (my internet is jank, don't judge me lol)

There was A LOT that I loved about this game, and there were some things I think that needed a tad more time to develop. So let's get into it!

I think Kronos, Ares and Chaos Islands were all great. The environments were gorgeous to traverse. I found myself being lost in the ambiance of the open zones. The immersive music accompanying the open zones is the cherry on top. Boosting, performing tricks, and finding the Chaos Emeralds was more relaxing than I thought it would be!

The combat system is well-thought out and gave a stronger sense of what Sonic is capable of. His skills are also very fun to use. Using the Cyloop as well as doing cool finishers on enemies gave another layer to Sonic's strength and agility in battle.

The story itself was mysterious and kept my attention throughout. The characters in the story also went through their own arcs that I think showed them as more true to form than previous games in the series. For example, Knuckles wasn't portrayed as a dimwit in this game, and instead had a rival-esque banter with Sonic. I think Ian Flynn proved himself while being at the helm writing the story for this game. The ever-evolving story with islands shrouded in mystery never failed to keep me curious.

Unfortunately, this may be where my compliments end in this review. There are certain aspects of the above mentioned that I think needed more fleshing out.

Cyberspace was a mixed bag for me. Exploring the islands and finding Cyberspace portals was a treat because I didn't know what I was going to get. Some levels I think were a lot of fun, and from a design standpoint, were cool callbacks from previous games. However, the repetitive themes of Green Hill, Sky Sanctuary, Chemical Plant and the City made levels blend in after a certain point. I think more variety in the themes would have been nice. Games like Sonic and Mario have common settings, but when those settings become an over saturated occurrence, that when it becomes an issue. Also, the reuse of previous stage layouts in earlier games is somewhat of a letdown. While it may hit the nostalgia button for fans, this comes across as a bit uninspired. The controls in Cyberspace left a lot to be desired. This was especially the case with the 2D stages, which I found Sonic to control very sluggishly. Also, turning and using the camera in 3D sections seemed very restricted.

As I said before, the first 3 open zones were well thought out. However, there are certain open zone aspects that I think needed more time, regarding all 5 islands. For starters, the 2d sections across all 5 islands feel shoehorned in. I get that the developers were trying to cater to many Sonic fans, but in a game where exploration is a fundamental part of the story, the 2D sections felt a bit forced.

Now this is where I talk about the second half of the game, after Chaos Island, so SPOILER ALERT. You have been warned!

I think there was a lot of build up in terms of the story in the first half that didn't pay off in the second half.

Rhea Island I found to be negligible. It served more to move the story along, but the fact that it's on another part of Kronos Island is a bit of a letdown. I wish it had been a different theme like the previous islands. The idea of Sonic being corrupted was cool in concept, but the resolution was such a cop out. I think it was a missed opportunity to have Tails, Knuckles and Amy to be playable to help Sonic.

Ouranos Island was ok. It had the nature theme like Rhea and Kronos Islands, but it just feels forgettable. Again, another theme for the island would have been cool. From a story standpoint, Sage was a cool character to get to know. I gotta say though, the final boss and the boss in Hard Mode were HIGHLY disappointing. Easily one of the worst final boss in Sonic games. All of this anticipation of fighting something grandiose to be met with unfulfilled expectations. I wish the finale of the game wasn't such a letdown, because the first two thirds of the game were wonderful.

PROS:
+first 3 islands are open and diverse
+engaging story
+combat and bosses are amazing
+incredible music
+plenty of Cyberspace stages to replay for S ranks
+Big the Cat is back

CONS:
-Cyberspace stages vary in quality
-4 level themes become repetitive
-controls and physics are awkward
-last 2 islands are a letdown
-no variety in last 2 islands
-story fizzles out very quickly
-final boss is a major disappointment

Overall, I think the game was a wonderful experience up until the second half. I didn't hate Ouranos Island, I just felt like I saw the same thing already with Kronos Island. 4 of the islands were fun to explore. My hope for the future is that this Open Zone format is implemented in later games with more tweaks, more characters to play as who would benefit from the skill tree, and more time to figure out to include a fleshed out finale. Also, I would love for Sonic Team to take more time on a consistent aesthetic in terms of the world around Sonic and his friends. I think the game is a step in the right direction, but it is certainly not without its flaws.

FINAL SCORE: 7.8/10",,
"I originally didn't expect much, but it's worth every penny. It was the most surprising game I have ever played and a black horse I didn't see coming. Epic soundtrack, even better boss fights, great exploration and a story that is touching, tragic and not to mention, full of treasures for a Sonic fan. My choice for Game of the Year.",,
"Oh how I wish Steam would let me rate a game beyond ""yes game good"" or ""no game bad"".

I do think Frontiers is a good game... but it needed so much more work. Towards the end you can just feel how Sonic Team was forced to wrap development up. It's unpolished, full of half done ideas, and when it was over it felt lacking like there was so much more game that was supposed to be here.

However. This game gets two REALLY important things right:
1) It feels so good to play as Sonic. Running around the islands, which is the main portion of the gameplay, is an absolute blast. I never got bored of grinding rails, timing jumps just right to hit springs, and zipping through the landscape.
2) The writing. Praise be to Ian Flynn! The dialogue in this game is S tier, this is characterization done right. There's actual story and lore! The big ""villain"" was a bit underwhelming but everything else was a joy.

This game has passion. The people behind it clearly cared about what they were making and wanted to do more but weren't given the time. The foundation for an amazing 3D Sonic game is here. Just... please SEGA... Listen to the fans, listen to the developers. Don't throw this away.

Also, give us the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ chao garden back.",,
good,,
Final boss fight is ass,,
"Could not be happier with how this game turned out. Yes there are some flaws to it, but overall I was pleasantly surprised with what this game had to offer. I feel like this game is a step in the right direction for Sonic and I am looking forward to seeing how the future plays out.

Best way to describe this game: It is not Sonic Forces 2.",,
"It took me around 22 hours to beat this game, tbf I was trying to get everything on each island xD

I had a really good time exploring the islands, the liberty of movement made it fun to try different ways around puzzles and terrain.
while it had become a little repetitive by the time I reached the last island the enemy fights were just delightful!
While you don't need to do all side stories, it was a nice way to piece the story and they contained little references here and there.
The music's gotta be what sold me! a wide range of genres and, in my opinion, it surpasses most sonic soundtracks!

0/10 no hay muskallonga :V",,
"After playing Frontiers, this game is really fun. Would replay it again down the line. There were parts where I wasn't even collecting anything or progressing in the story, but just having fun with the movement in the game. The story was well written and not rushed like some other titles felt; it felt like something new. While Cyberspace felt like a drag at times, the open world made up for it. The combat felt fresh and new, the skill tree implementation was neat to see, just with there were more moves or enhancements with it. There are issues like graphical limitations on the pc version for some reason along with horrendous pop-ins; excluding graphics though that's really only the complaint I had with the game. Hoping to see more future projects like this from Sonic Team in the near future; they did really well with this title. 9/10",,
"I'm a little upset I'm just writing this now but... this game goes hard. Easily my favorite 3D sonic game, now the game isn't without its flaws but I don't think objects popping in at a close distance should be the main reason you don't purchase THE video game of all time. Also the soundtrack goes so hard, the titan themes are some of my personal favorites.",,
"No, it's not a perfect game. there is a lot of issues like all the pop in, the cyberspace physics, and the pacing in the second half, but it's the most fun I've had with a Sonic game since Adventure 2 and hopefully a great base for the series going forward.",,
The Game is good so far but if your using linux in my case ubuntu turn off bloom effects the river trail will glow bright green from a far turning it off wont make the green river go away but it wont glow bright if sage doesn't fix it the proton community probably will,,
"This game a new start for 3D Sonic. I had fun, I enjoyed my time with it. There are a lot of weird jank and bugs but it's still a good time. Hopefully in the future they make a game where you can play as more than just Sonic.",,
"As someone who has unlocked every achievement, I can say Sonic Frontiers is Sonic's big break in gaming. Years of ridicule all sum up to this, a project that was cared and worked on extensively and it all paid off.

I thoroughly enjoyed playing the game and had a lot of fun exploring and fighting the Titans, along with the new story line and voice direction.
The music is definitely the high point, from sombre open zone music to the energetic battle music.

I'm excited for what is to come for Frontiers and hope that Sonic Team allows Sonic to thrive for multiple years to come.",,
"This is the Sonic game I always wish I had when I was younger.

I've been a passive fan of Sonic since I was a little kid. I played the classic ones, a couple of DS games, Shadow the Hedgehog, and most recently before this one Sonic Mania. But none of them fully had my interest and left me wishing they did Sonic differently. I have always been interested in the idea of Sonic the Hedgehog but never enjoyed the execution of it. That is until this game.

This game works as a sort of new leaf for the franchise, while still acknowledging events from previous games, is beginner-friendly and welcomes all sorts of Sonic fans a new experience. I found myself running around spending hours having fun just collecting things to upgrade Sonics stats or complete challenges. The story was simple but effective, and is definitely pointed towards the direction I'd like to see Sonic go.

With such a colourful variety of characters and a dragon ball-esque concept regarding the Chaos Emeralds, the Sonic franchise has tons of content to utilise and explore with, be it with the main characters like Knuckles, Tails & Shadow, or lesser characters like Big the Cat and Espio the Chameleon, there's all sorts of stories and adventures we could see. This is a solid start Sega, and I hope that the Sonic franchise will be able to redefine itself and gain the recognition and love it deserves!",,
"Completed it 100%, At first I was very unsure about how long I was going to play it but I decided to stick through it and boy did I get my money's worth. This game may be one of the best sonic games in years since its few hiccups on previous release titles. Whilist the gameplay took a turn from its traditional sonic run through levels style. this has potential for future games to build upon this. But there are atleast 40 cyberspace levels from Traditional gameplay to balance inbetween.

I can see games for Shadow being styled into this with the combat being vastly overhauled and longer skill tree's. I wish the boss fights were longer and more beefier but from what I got out of it this is a very positive step to the sonic team for going above and beyond and trying something new. And the music.. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! 10/10 they have nailed it.",,
elder koco upgrades cause severe mental disfunction,,
shadow the hedgehog approved,,
"Good game, the world can feel a bit empty at times, and the cyber levels can feel repetitive, but overall i enjoyed my experience",,
"The ""secret"" final boss, which you unlock by going into by setting your difficulty to hard before getting the last Emerald, is the worst decision Sonic Team has ever made, and it is only the worst because the rest of the game is really really good, and therefore that boss is the most colossal letdown in the history of the franchise.

So, good game, definitely get it if you're a Sonic fan, just don't go into the final boss on hard mode unless you really like Touhou and other 2D Space Shooter bullet hells.",,
"I have been a sonic fan for ages, and while this game can be rough around the edges at first, similarly to Legends: Arceus, the flow state that I get into because of the almost addicting gameplay loop this game has, both with combat and platforming, made it a worthwhile investment.

This game, like Forces, is easy to approach for casual gamers, but unlike Forces, it doesn't treat the consumer like a literal child and gives you freedom rather than being stuck on a set path the whole way. It is also a much longer game than Forces, on a casual playthrough it took me almost 20 hours to complete the main story.

While Sonic doesn't control as well as he did in Generations and Unleashed, Sonic definitely feels way better here than in Forces, he doesn't feel floaty, and he runs very smoothly in the open zones.

I will say that the use of Quixel Megascans does not mesh well with the platforms and rails, and I was hoping that these platforming segments in the open zones were more creatively integrated into the landscape, creating a union with the platforming and the Megascanned environment. I do have more to say about it artistically, as I think the art direction could have been much better than just using Megascans, and I was missing some of the iconic Sonic flora and fauna.

The story is much better than it was in Forces, with Ian Flynn replacing the previous English writers. There is definitely a more genuine serious tone here, with legitimate stakes in the story. The characters are more likable, and feel more fleshed out. However, comparing this story to the Adventure games, Heroes, and even Unleashed, Sonic Frontiers unfortunately lacks in the cheesy yet endearing camp of those previous titles, and at times actually takes itself too seriously.

This game is a giant leap in the right direction for Sonic Team, and hopefully after this game, Sega will start hiring more people into Sonic Team to make their next game the very best (apparently the dev team for Sonci Frontiers was just 60 people, which is absolutely insane for a triple A franchise like Sonic, Sega what the hell are you doing??)",,

"So.. Sonic frontiers. I have a lot to say about this title and gonna be honest? It's a good game, but could've been better, but I feel like SEGA and sonic team tried to rush this for the holidays which isn't anything surprising since sales do better during that time period but it does hinder the overall experience.

Now let's go by one thing at a time. First, the islands/hub world. I think it's the best part of this game, the second one being my favorite out of the bunch and I REALLY wish they've done more with the islands because I can see the potential with what they have, I really think them saying this game is 'open world' is a bit misleading, I would say it's a more of a 'sandbox' kind of game. Basically think about it like how mario odyssey is, large open levels that you can explore and go collecting moons. That's how frontiers is approached, with that type of game philosophy. But now with that in mind, what they have is good, even with the weird pop ins here and there but I felt like they've could've expand it more by adding more variety than just oh here's the platforms and the rails. I wanted to so that you can BUILD the islands to traverse through, the puzzles SORT OF do that, but they only add rails and reveal the map. It would've been cool if as you progressed through the story or do the cyberspace levels, you add onto more of the map. Because you can have so much fun with the hub worlds, I had a fun time just blast through the place with what they had and hell, I felt like I was playing sonic adventure 1 with the amount of speed you can have, especially if you get it juuust right and you ZOOM towards where you want to head. It's easily my favorite part of the game

Second, the combat and enemies. I will admit, the combat is pretty repetitive and can be pretty brain dead if you want to just spam the attack button but since you actually have moves now, you can be flashy with what you wanna pull off. Sure it's sometimes a simple 'hold this or press this' and you can do the move, but it's more of the flashiness of it and seeing sonic perform these moves makes it so cool, but I do wish they could've expand on the combat more because I do see some lost potential in there, since it is pretty easy to make it out before you're even at the mid point of the game. As for the enemies? The variety is there and I do enjoy what they have, the mini bosses on the hub world are pretty entertaining and as the more fodder enemies they fit what island they're from. But where the game really shines? The titans, they are so fricking cool, just seeing super sonic handle a fricking evangelion unit while having some kickass music blasting. Easily the highlight of the bosses and does make use of the combat a lot better than the mini bosses, but they're also pretty easy for the most part. Since all of have to do is get close enough and go ham on them but I think what makes people go crazy is when you finish them off. They're so good, my personal favorite being the third island again. I won't spoil it any further, but once you see it- You'll feel like a little kid again.

The Cyberspace levels and controls; The controls are. The controls feel janky in this title, especially if you're going from generations - forces - frontiers; like for example, the boosting is tweaked so that you aren't so ridiculously fast like in generations but when you jump you basically lose all momentum, especially if you try to air boost. The air boosting got nerfed in this title, so you can't use it that much anymore and the homing attack has this delay on it so you can consistently homing attack anymore; but it does have a nice perk to it. It's called homing attack cancel, basically cancelling a homing attack to a boost and BOY DOES THAT GIVE YOU A LOT OF MOMENTUM REAL QUICK. It's a lot of fun if you get it down consistently. But then here comes the worst part of the game; the Cyberspace levels, now I get that they're supposed to be from Sonic's memories but they are so short. It has the forces problem where the level ends before it can even start, and it's no different here. I can honest to god name like only two levels that are only past the 2;30 mark but even then that's pretty short compared to what we had previously. And you feel so slow when you try to not boost since also the boost now has a meter that isn't charged by rings anymore or destroying badniks. I can get their intentions with the Cyberspace levels; bite sized tradition levels but I honest to god wish that they didn't do that and instead made it so that the levels felt like actual levels instead of it suffering like forces and ending before it begins. The only thing that carries the Cyberspace levels is the music but other than that, I can't say that I didn't enjoy the levels but there is a lot missing that makes you feel empty.

Story, VAs and Music; Now I know people have a history of hating Ian Flynn but I do think he did the characters much needed justice by actually making them characters in the story. They don't feel so one sided anymore and actually show that they DO have faults and acknowledge their mistakes. Sure some of the dialogue is a bit awkward but this game has done them much more justice than the past decade, especially sonic. Sonic's no longer a snarky guy who's constantly spouting one liners. I feel he's back to his former self with how they portray him. And I do think that the voice actors did a good job, especially Roger and Mike. It was weird at first hearing a more deeper voice of Sonic but it did fit with this setting that the game chose. And the eggman codecs? They were VERY JUICY and I feel like mike has sold it in that as well. Amy's voice actor sounds flat a lot of times but I did she did okay, Tails is on the same levels as Amy's VA but she was less awkward with voicing tails and the interactions felt much better than Amys, as for knuckles? I think he did a good job too, especially with the small interactions he has with sonic. They were very good, Sage's VA was pretty monotone but given that she's an AI and all? I think she did a great job with what she had. Now the story- Well... I can say it did more than the previous titles, like the mystery with the ancients was there and it made me think like I couldn't believe there was some EVEN before the echidnas and whatnot and I desperately wished that they've gone more in depth with it because Sage as a villain- She didn't REALLY do anything other than tell sonic he was going to fail on his quest and it shows as near the end of the game I can tell the game was just rushing for the ending. Spoilers for the ending of the game here! But enough about that. Now time for the music- I really enjoyed the tracks they had! Too bad for most it was short due to the cyberspace levels, but at least we had the fishing and titans. God I love the titan's songs so much.

Final thoughts; This game is a 7.5/10. This game could've been great but it was rushed, now would I pay 60$ for it? Nah. Definitely get it on a sale, but I do recommend on giving this game a try. And if you like it, that's good and if ya don't? that's okay. But definitely looking forward to what sega has to offer in store in the next title.",,
"Best. Sonic. Ever. I cannot emphasize this enough. If you've been hurt by the 3D Sonic games of the past, the game will be the breath of fresh air you never knew a Sonic game could be. Its not perfect of course - there are definitely things that can be improved. But its is 100% the best direction they could've taken and hopefully will continue to take with Sonic.
Great gameplay. Amazing OST. A fantastic shakeup to the 3D Sonic franchise.",,
same price as elden ring btw,,
the last time a Sonic game this good came out I wasn't depressed,,
PEAK FRONTIERS,,
"Best 3D Sonic game since SA2. Wasn't a fan of the voice acting and ended up turning it off 1/4 of the way through. However, the game took me back to the good ol' days of Sonic and for that I thank you, Sonic Team.",,
He do the fast,,
♥♥♥♥ the pain away my bed is in ruin,,
"As a fan of the series since the Genesis/Megadrive, this is the most consistently fun Sonic has felt in 3D. This plays like how you remember the Adventure games playing in your head (but actually better). This is a great melding of Adventure style and boost era style game-play. Pop in is abundant so if that is a deal breaker maybe wait for a sale, but you will lose track of time while playing because of how fun and satisfying it is to traverse the open zones and trying to optimize your time in the Cyber Stages.",,
"I won't sugar coat It. Sonic's had one hell of a rocky road when it comes to recent titles. But I've been a sonic fan to this very moment. This would only mean that for sonic games the bar is very low with what's impressive and what isn't. But I had to say this game gave me an overwhelmingly excited reaction process as more gameplay was shown off, It seemed to be more and more stable as the game progressed. And now we're finally here. I've played and beaten the game and Find myself coming back on the regular. There is nitpicks because not every game is perfect. But:

The Game Has bugs of course. Wouldn't be a Sonic game without them. But I've only run into a solid two to three throughout my whole experience.

It's very very Fetch Quest like, If you wish to just continue the story. However If you wanna run around You won't even realize you have a number requirement of things needed to continue the story.

The game Is not very challenging. There has been a few challenges which shocked me, but It's mostly been an easy adventure. Now this isn't very bad considering I still had a blast playing.

And now for pluses. I could go on and on and on and on and on. This game has been the most fun I've had In a sonic game to date. And I'd say the price point is actually pretty worth it. Long story. Amazing blasts of a time. And just overall a great experience. I'm not very good at writing reviews so this review might not be very well put together But I thought i'd just set my thoughts out there for those wanting to pick it up
I recommend :)",,
"some jank but it's a solid entry. good writing / music.

the narrative's not overly-cheesy, but also doesn't take itself too seriously.

already has an active modding community just days after release. it's solid enough for me to 100% on hard with stock physics and only cosmetic mods and an Elder Koco fix applied. Boss Select is a good mod after beating the game.

unlocking fast travel asap / fishing is meta.

disable gameplay notifications.",,
"Its not perfect but its the best 3D sonic I have played to date. The game is an overall blast and is easily repayable due to there only being a main quest story line to follow which in itself can be sped up through the fishing mini game skipping large chunks of each island. The game overall is not the most challenging unless you aim to complete the game 100%. Would hope they add DLC or even a boss rush since, the only thing you unlock for completing the game is an arcade mode that allows you to play any gate level from the title menu.",,
"This is easily the best 3d Sonic game to come out in a long time. Though, it does have its fair share of issues. The pop in is really noticeable, the open world segments feel like glorified hub levels, and the collectibles can get tedious if you're going for all the side objectives like I did. But, there are a lot of good ideas in this game as well. The combat felt nice, and was more in depth than I expected, the story was good, even if it was a standard hero saves the day story, and the cyberspace levels were a ton of fun to play through.

Overall the game lacks polish and has some jank to it, but I thing they have a good groundwork here. If they can take this formula, improve on it, and polish it more, I genuinely believe we could see the best of Sonic in the coming years, and overall, it's really refreshing to see.",,
"Back when this game came out it was a great sonic game. The open zone was nice but it had some problems with the game. The supersonic fights were also great fighting those big titans. Then update 1 gave us photo mode which is nice for getting crazy pictures and the ability to choose what song we want to listen to. Then the big one came update 2. The open world looks nice and we actually have momentum ow. It could use some fine-tuning. The spindash is just a better boost. Unlike gens and unleashed the boost doesn't make you invincible to enemies, but with the spindash you can run into enemies and it is fine.

What needs to be fixed is cyber space and momentum. This game could be a 10/10 after update 3 which I am excited for.

I would recommend this game to anyone who is debating on getting it.",,
"8/10. Has clear flaws and corners were cut 3rd island onward, but still a ton of fun. Can't wait for the sequel.",,
you actually can go pretty fast,,
Better than sex,,
"It's a good game. 7/10.

Spoilers:",,
"Product received for free

I've played a ton of Sonic since I was born. Everything on Genesis, everything on Game Gear, every 3D entry, every spinoff. From the highs to the mids to the lows.

Frontiers is one of the highs. It's not perfect, but it's good. Well worth playing through, if not getting 100%.",,
"TL;DR - Get this with low expectations and on sale.

Having not touched a newer Sonic game since Generations (for non-Sonic/Sega reasons), I bought this with relatively tame expectations.

High speed action? Yeah, it's got it.

♥♥♥♥♥♥♥' soundtrack? Nailed it.

Tolerable gameplay? ...no.

My first hour was spent trying to get a feel for how Sonic handles and NOT yeeting myself into the ocean. If you survived Cronos Island without doing this, congrats: you're a better player than me. After learning that going fast was not always good, I actually got to opening the full game up more.

I was also struggling with the non-intuitive control set up. This was the first Sonic game I had played where Homing Attack wasn't the same input as the jump. Kiss years of muscle memory good-bye there. I had to also cope with the Drop Dash trying to go off after double jumping every so often, which added to my yeet problem above. Points to whoever let it go solidly enough to scale Island 3's icy bits, but that thing just felt almost uncontrollable.

Fast forward a couple hours. By this point I'd seen the ""you got max rings, time for a Boost boost!"" cutscene 50 times, and I had no option to just bypass it entirely. Flow ruined every time. I was also sick of minibosses I'd beat commanding my camera every time I dared wander too close. I have neither the desire, nor need, to fight another hecking Strider, tyvm. This is also when I noticed the recycled assets from the prior map. At least it made exploring easier, but *really*?

My biggest gripe preventing me from progressing right now is Island #4. I borked climbing a tower that I need to climb for story reasons, and now I'm stuck waiting for a star shower/enemy respawn event just to try and progress again? NO. Hell NO.

I'm uninstalling until Sonic Team can fix this, plus a few other substantial issues other people have mentioned.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is messy and flawed, but the positives outweigh the negatives for me. There are many criticisms to be made, and while the issues are more than just nitpicks, the sum total of their weight isn't crushing. This game's greatest strength is that controlling Sonic in a wide-open 3D environment feels really, REALLY good - and if anything feels off, you can go into the options menu and tweak the handling to your liking, which is an amazing addition. The writing and characterization is INCREDIBLE (thank you Ian Flynn) and Sonic and co. feel dimensional and nuanced for the first time in a long time. That alone would sell me on this game, but the gameplay stands on its own, despite its blemishes.
The pop-in is VERY noticeable and at times distracting, although this didn't significantly impact my enjoyment of the game. Combat is at times mindless button-mashing - but not every enemy is just a sponge for punches and kicks. Fights are at their best when you have to use a variety of Sonic's movement abilities rather than just the attack button, and the miniboss ""Guardians"" are designed with that in mind. The mishmash of floating rails and platforms against a natural environment doesn't look all that good, but running around on them, it didn't bother me much because the gameplay works even if the art design was a bit lacking. A little bite of a platforming challenge here and there to get memory tokens kept me motivated to further explore. I DO wish that collectible pickups didn't respawn, though. They feel far less important when you can generate an infinite supply.
My biggest issue with the game is that it ONCE AGAIN reuses assets and even level design from Generations for the Cyber Space levels. Green Hill is great and all, but if I had filet mignon for dinner ever night, I'd probably get sick of it, too. Far more welcome are recreations of levels in Cyber Space that HAVEN'T been done to death - doesn't matter what coat of paint it's dipped in, I recognize Sky Rail anywhere. Playing these level recreations with Frontiers movement is fun and refreshing.
It's the first good Sonic game in a long time. There are ideas here worth exploring in future titles, and I hope Sonic Team iterates on this approach instead of abandoning it because it has a few shortcomings. They're really onto something with this game. It's well worth its ~20 hours of playtime, and I wish it were longer.",,
"Best 3D Sonic game in years. Good writing that makes Sonic cool again, INSANELY good music, gameplay is super fun and exploring feels fulfilling. It's even good if you haven't played Sonic before, but even better if you have. This game was a cathartic experience from start to finish, highly recommend.
I will now complete it 5 more times 10/10 experience",,
It's like baby's first Devil May Cry with a boost button. Drop Dash is fun. Bosses are incredible.,,
A solid foundation for future Sonic titles.,,
"He jugado básicamente todos los juegos de Sonic y puedo decir sin dudarlo que este es el mejor que hemos tenido en los últimos años (junto con Mania). La exploración es muy divertida, el control de Sonic es perfecto, las zonas del cyberspace están muy buenas sin abrumar tanto ya que son muy cortas. Ademas, la historia y personajes están muy bien desarrollados hasta donde voy.

Algo me dice que este juego va a ser perfecto para mods en el futuro, me imagino como los fans meterán mapas nuevos y de juegos anteriores y funcionaran increíblemente bien, ojala así sea.

En México por alguna razón este juego cuesta solo 750 pesos (35 usd) por ese precio no dudes en comprarlo, especialmente si eres fan de la serie.",,
"One of the best Sonic games we've had, and a really solid action platform game.

PROS:

- The graphics are good
- The soundtrack is amazing (The boss music is some of the best in the series)
- The combat is really fun, theres a decent amount of variety to it, and it doesn't really seem to get boring fast.

- Open-Zone: Its nice to finally have a Sonic game were you not only go fast, but go fast freely. Its so much fun just running around the map really fast.

- Story: The story is pretty good for a platformer. Don't expect something with an insane amount of depth, but you do really feel the emotion and connections between Sonic and his friends with the various side stories and cutscenes.

- Boss battles: The boss battles go hard, like really hard in this game, and I love it.

- Lots of things to do on each map, while you try to 100% the map.

- fishing. Enough said

- Lore: For those who are fans of the Sonic game series, there is a lot of mentions to previous main titles in the series that are nice nods to previous titles.

- Optimization: Seems like the game is optimized pretty well. I didnt have any issues while playing, aside from ugly pop ins, but those werent that bad to me personally.


CONS:

- Movement: The movement for the most part is fine, but it does get kinda wonky sometimes. I feel like overall though they did pretty good, because I always notice in Sonic games, its hard to balance the ability to move quickly whenever you want, and also keep smaller, more subtle actions polished in the process, if that makes sense.

- Some of the Cyber stages: Theres a few levels that really either needed to not be included, or polished up, a lot. The physics of the open-zone don't always translate best into the cyber levels. But with that said, the majority of them are still really fun.

- Cyber stages again: They rebuilt a lot of Sonics best previous levels from older games, but reskinned them. It would have been nice to see more variations in these skins. Most levels either looked like Green Hill zone or Hydrocity from Sonic 2.

- Steam Deck: So the game can run stable on the steam deck if you lock it to 30 fps, or go low graphics and shadows, but there are a lot of graphical glitches currently. So if you only have a steam deck and not a PC, and you wanna play Sonic, I would wait, or get it on a console.


So overall though, as a Sonic game I would give this an 8.5/10 because everything about it is great, and I feel like SEGA has the right formula down, it could just use a few tweaks here or there to improve on.

As a platformer, I would say its probably a solid 8/10",,
long time no see,,
Most fun I've had with a Sonic game since SA2. It's incredible!!,,
Open zone is the future !,,
its pretty good,,
"So I've never written a review, so to be brief...
This is my favorite Sonic experience in 20 years.
This game is far from perfect in terms of moments of frustration mechanically here and there, but overall I have had such a blast playing this game. This is one of those games that just feels so consistently fun. After so many years with Sonic titles really not pulling me back in, this really was exactly what I was hoping for from Sonic.
This game is really cool. Props to the devs for making Sonic fun again.",,
"Sonic's like that kid in school who doesn't try in lessons but you know he can do so much better. Frontiers is like when said kid has clearly put effort into an assignment, but you can tell he did most of it last night and there's still some rough edges here and there.

tl;dr - the open zones are very good but cyber space is very not good",,
"+ The core gameplay. With roaming around the countryside and doing platform puzzles you have a primary gameplay loop that is fun and engaging.
+ The more typical 3D levels are polished, play well and are fun.
+ The music, though it's an odd combination. The titan bosses are themed to death metal (which is quite funny imo), while the Cyber Space level's music often sounds like it comes straight out of Nature One.
+ The story. It's pretty decent and will appeal to Sci-Fi lovers as it feels like it is right at home in a game of Stellaris.

You can see it gets the important bits right, while the negatives are more nitpicky. Some of these surprise me that these haven't been addressed prior to release:

- The pop-in. It's pretty bad even with all settings maxed out. With so many graphics options it's weird that they didn't include an option to increase the draw distance.
- The (secret) final boss. Without spoiling anything, having this entire concept as final ""epic"" boss in a Sonic game is idiotic.
- The vendors, one in particular. Why didn't they include a button to hand in all critters in one go???
- The second titan has so many visual effects happening at once that it becomes really hard to see which you are supposed to parry.

All-in-all: 8/10",,
"If you don't get caught up in the pointless collectathon this is a fun 8 to 10 hour game with some good music fun mechanics and a boring but decent story. But if you're a O.C.D. completionist I recommend staying away because your play through will go from 8 hours to closer to 25. Especially since these collectables aren't exactly fun or interesting. Also another complaint would be the camera, it might be the most frustrating camera I've ever dealt with in a video game.
Overall a weak 7/10 probably could've been an 8 if the game had some more time in the oven to work out it's camera and occasional physics oddities.",,
It's like fast bingus,,

"Sonic Frontiers is like a slightly under baked cookie. It's not perfectly made but it's still pretty good. Honestly I've had a blast with this game, Cyber Space is my main issue with the game do to the sluggish change in control over Sonic but mods fix that. Over all an 8 out of 10 for me.",,
"Lots of very cool moments for Sonic. You get to see him do all kinda neat stuff and be nice to his friends while beating up robots like in anime fights. I had a lot of fun with it even if it does get tedious at times in the inbetween parts - thankfully, they go by fast (and you're Sonic so it's fine anyway. He is blue).

Eggman's immortal daughter is also very good but kinda flat as a character. Very by the numbers but I hope she comes back in a cool and possibly evil way!",,

The game has flaws (draw distance, and some performance issues for example) but overall I really enjoyed my time with it for what that's worth.",,
As someone who 100% the game. I can say with certainity this is the best sonic game i've ever played. Has a lot of elements from other sonic games. Sonic Adventure.Sonic Heroes amongst others. A mashup of everything we love. You will absolutely love it!!!,,
"Its quite a fresh take for Sonic and a much better pull then what's been shoved down everyone's throats in past sonic games.

We go through characters while learning some lore of the creatures that lived on islands. While going through small levels which could ether be the worse part of the game or to some who haven't played any sonic games in a while could be the best. they always go back to what could be considered classic level design or reused assets instead of making new levels entirely. For me I haven't played a sonic game since mania and lost world. so this in whole was a perfect remedy to my sour taste from lost world and the 3d taste I wanted that mania couldn't give. Although the 3rd island felt more yikes for me considering its full of forced camera angels but past that its been a wonderful experience and is a must buy from me. this game still has issues and feels undeveloped in some areas the most I feel this too is the skills, but was a great time especially with the characters, my only wish is there was more room for more sonic characters in general in here. we get 4 of Sonic's allies and 1 is a fishing cat. me being on the last island I don't believe will be seeing anyone else unless its a surprise at the end.

The music in this game is also a whole thing in itself some of the best I've heard from a game in such a long time. Its the type you'd play on the go let alone be having in a game.

I say the experience was well worth the $60 I'm right around the corner to finishing the game. I say it can be completed in 20 hours if your speedy and not going for a 100% if you are most likely 25 hours to 30.",,
"Haven't had this much fun with a 3D sonic game since Sonic Generations. The only issues that I had is that it needed more polish, and there were some areas where the game would miss an auto spring or rail, causing me to fall to my death.

Otherwise, for a first attempt at an open world Sonic game, this was amazing!

Sega, please ignore the reviews, learn from your mistakes from this game, and further improve the formula that you have provided here.",,

"It is fun, I haven't had this much fun in a Sonic game in a long time, Sonic Colors and Sonic Generations are the last Good games I had with sonic and I am loving this game, the music, the ability to change the setting, only issue is that I can't change the graphics, if I get too far down into the menu options of the graphic settings it crashes the game to desktop.

As for the story and game play, it's good for a sonic game goes with the story, better is the freedom of movement and how fast you can go, It is absolutly worth picking up if you are a sonic fan, if you are not a sonic fan it may not be your cup of tea but you should try it if only to get it on sale.

And for the Charaters, they fell a bit more grownup, a bit more mature and less cartoony, but it isn't a bad thing, they feel much more balanced, they are cartoony when they need to be, not when they don't have to be. And I love the little scince notes from Eggman/Robotnik. It gets you to hear his thought and understanding. I like that, it is like envormental story telling but for the charater in what they are seeing and trying to understand and making you get their though processes and story telling about them.

If you ask me this is Sonic going in the right direction and yes, you should buy it, not going to say you need to, that is up to you to decide. But if you want a fast bit of collecting and short but sweet sonic levels, this is it.

Also the songs for the first three Bosses, THEY ARE METAL AS F$#& and I will have no arguments.",,
"after over a day of playtime and fully completing everything this game has to offer, i've come to a conclusion:

sonic gear rising revengeance

please buy this game
goty (if they fix the pop in)",,
We're back sonic bros!,,
"i waited till the final free dlc to share my thoughts,but this game is pretty good, the rails in the sky might be off-putting and random, but chaining them together is very satisfying, this game with the spindash is soo much better , the plot isn't epic , but the writing is hands down the best thing about this game,i hope sega keeps ian flynn and gives him more creative freedom in the future,also the music is amazing. the main game cyberspace levels are lazy and visually boring, but the spindash does make them MUCH better , the dlc cyberspace levels are really fun,but please stop reusing greenhill and chemical plant.
as for the other characters,tails is boring because he has no homing attack and flying doesn't feel as good as in adventure, they fixed knuckles gliding thankfully with a recent patch,but he doesn't build up speed the longer u glide with him, and amy is the best one among the three, but i hope they emphasis her pikopiko hammer more than the tarot cards. all of them were not designed for combat like sonic, speaking of.. the game's combat feels like an after thought ,it's all just button mashy and mindless, the commands to use some special moves aren't good like dmc or bayo so u might do some attacks accidentally, but the bosses are incredible,the game can be a little repetitive but i never got tired of it.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is a great game and show potentially a step right direction for 3D sonic games, if Team Sonic can put more quality in these types of games, firstly this game is way better forces in story, level design, world, writing, and mainly gameplay since i felt sonic force modern sonic was highlight for me. the boss is super fun and the music gives that extra kick, sonic control is really fluid, not perfect but much better than in previous games. the graphic is decent but a lot of pop in which becomes super annoying but not a deal breaker for me personally but I see this as a step forward for 3D sonic games having redemption if Sonic Team put more into this. I also felt collecting hearts and tokens is quite tedious just to progress the story and i do wish to see cyberspace have more level design like seaside hills, ocean palaces, emerald coasts, speed highways etc. like typical green hills, chemical plant and sky sanctuary but overall while I don't recommend this full price but on steam sales, this is worth play if u love platformers games or 3D sonic games as this really fun to play",,

"i love this game, legit the best sonic game in YEARS, it's incredibly fun and the open world is really fun to explore with sonics moveset. the writing is peak sonic writing and the fact that the era of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jokes and forgettable stories is over is so refreshing to know, so happy that this is the new step in the sonic franchise, i hope this game get's post release content :)",,
"A great base for Sonic to build on.
I have some issues various elements, like some aspects of the controls and the cyber space levels reusing so much (even if its a plot thing). But open zone exploration is fun, just needs more creativity put into the world design. Combat is fun and flashy but very simple at times. I enjoyed most of the story, especially as someone from the Adventure era of Sonic. All in all, it's the most fun I've had with Sonic in a loooong time.",,
"Used to be pretty fun before the final horizon update. Even if it was really easy (even on hard mode), the content there was at least fun enough for me to overlook the baby gameplay. In the new update however, the devs seem to have MASSIVELY over-corrected and made the new content way too hard to the point where you have to literally do speedrun tier strats to even do the cyberspaces, which is especially awful with the trash physics.
I didn't even bother to finish it, I just wasn't having fun. And don't get me wrong, I do enjoy challenging games, but I don't like when the game expects me to execute speedrun strats perfectly without any mistakes to be able to even progress. The way to do some cyberspace legitimately feels like cheating with how many weird uncomfortable strats you have to do.
The stories of the new characters are also pretty bad, they're just go to place watch the cutscene go to other place. No unique cyberspaces, nothing to do, just go to place and watch cutscene. I thought they would get whole campaigns, SA style, but apparently that's too much to ask for. Tails' 'go to place' part can even be skipped completely if you get the plane upgrade because it gives you infinite flight with infinite vertical movement. Also Amy's hammer got massively shafted in favour of her VERY iconic... tarot cards?
I know I'm going to get skill issued and clown emoji-d, but I don't care I'm not a sonic super-fan so I'm not going to invest too much time into putting up with all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I have more fun games to play.
This update also really made me notice just how bad the mechanics are, It really freaks out when you try to go fast, you know, like you do in a sonic game.

Bad.

Don't play it.",,
A great Sonic experience from start to finish. You don't want to miss this one!,,
I am so proud that I can finally say they have released a really great Sonic game after 21 years!,,
"No amount of jank can take away from what this game accomplishes, both as a fun action platformer and as a Sonic game.

The Open Zones are fun to explore throughout multiple playthroughs with tons of fun platforming sequences and level geometry to speed through. The combat is simple but fun and varied, and new puzzles and enemies are thrown at you on the regular to keep things fresh. Helping with this sense of exploration is the beautiful atmosphere and eclectic soundtrack, which I feel would alone make the game worth it if the gameplay wasn't already fantastic.

I personally find the Cyberspace levels quite fun, and a massive improvement over Sonic Forces' levels because of how tightly Sonic controls in this game, on top of his new mobility options and generous homing attack range. The controls lack the same fluidity of Unleashed and Generations, but that's really all that's needed if this iteration of Sonic Team wants to continue working on traditional Sonic levels. It also helps that completing Cyberspace levels helps you progress through the Open Zones; it's like if in Sonic Adventure, doing better in levels would help you progress through the world map.

I'm not as critical of Sonic's storytelling as other fans can be but there's no denying Ian Flynn's script really brings these beloved characters to life; many of the cutscenes are characters just talking about their feelings, which we haven't gotten in a while. The script is so good, I go out of my way to collect all the Tokens to see all the optional dialogue on an island, even if there's no in-game reward for doing so.

I can't really say anything that hasn't been said already. A great new foundation for future Sonic games has been established here, but it's also a great game on its own. Please pick it up and show Sega and Sonic Team your support and constructive criticism.

And don't be a jerk about it! This fandom needs to lighten up!",,
nice,,
"Sonic Frontiers is an amazing experience and I became fully immersed in what it had to offer, so immersed I had to 100% it!!",,
It’s not bad,,
i didnt mean to rush through the game but it was a lot of fun,,
"I honestly enjoyed my time playing this game. At no point did I get bored, instead I was entertained all the way through. It has its flaws but they are mostly superficial. The interesting thing is the open world. It's not 'endless possibilities, rather it gives you the space to 'go fast'. Something that's quite nice now that I have experienced it for myself. All in all, fully recommend this if you are a Sonic fan, it feels good.",,
"My God, the entire experience was amazing! This absolutely succeeds as Modern Sonic's redemption, and it really is the new best Sonic game after Sonic Generations! The gameplay was so much fun, the soundtrack is freaking amazing (of course, the series' music rarely disappoints), the writing was great, the voice direction was great as well, Sage is a very cool character, and the boss battles were freaking epic! Sonic Team finally redeemed themselves, as I had always hoped ever since this game was first teased. I totally recommend giving this game a try if you're into the open world genre. It's a real blast reaching far across these new frontiers!

Always to new horizons~!",,
Solid new direction for the series. Definitely a game that is better than the sum of its' parts.,,
Fun video game. Definitely game of the year.,,

almost better than sonic 06,,
"Not the best sonic game, but much better than expected and the story is going almost exactly like how fans have been asking for a decade now",,
"Sonic Frontiers shows a clear shift in Sonic Team's design philosophy in the best way possible.

Ever since the embarrassment that was Sonic Forces, I held onto a cautions optimism that we could still be delivered with a Sonic game that is both well written and fun to play. Luckily through the introduction of Ian Flynn as the primary writer, I'm happy to say that as a truly dedicated sonic fan, I was positively overwhelmed by the work done to apply the remarkably inconsistent lore to what I hope is a new era for Sonic. I particularly loved the sarcastically competitive but also down to earth and friendly interactions between Knuckles and Sonic. The more human look into Eggman is also a fantastic direction for the character but unfortunately he has little to no presence throughout the story and barely does anything. Sage is a welcome addition to the cast and I like her a lot but similar to Eggman, she didn't have much to do until the end.

The gameplay is also very solid, I have an immense amount of respect for the devs who were willing to take this chance with the daunting task of making an open world sonic game. I could feel the love and effort put into each island and environment. (not something i can say about forces.) While I do think it probably could have done with a bit more time in the oven, they tried their best and it certainly payed off. The combat was fun albeit slightly surface level but still a very welcome addition that i hope we haven't seen the last of. (what's the point in a parry if isn't time based at all?) Controlling Sonic hasn't felt this good for god knows how long, the boost has gone from a ""push A to win"" mechanic to a simple but fun movement tool which is what it should have been from the very start.

While I had a blast controlling Sonic across the starfall islands, things slightly fall apart in the cyber space levels. Firstly, i genuinely cant stand the reuse of Green Hill, Chemical Plant and Sky Sanctuary, and it's even worse that they take up 75% of all the level themes. I actually enjoyed seeing chunks of older level layouts, it made for a fun guessing game each time I entered the levels. Another thing that bogs down cyberspace however is the use of 2D sections. I'm of the opinion that 2D sections should have little to no place in 3D sonic games due to how much they slow down the pace of levels and reduce the freedom and creativity of Sonic's movement. That's not to say they're bad, the 2D sections were not badly designed by any means, it's just the 3D sections will always be more interesting, dynamic and fun. Ultimately i'm not overly bothered by this as cyberspace is mostly optional and each level is around 1-2 minutes so i think i can let it mostly slide.

The first three bosses were all stupidly fun and flying around as super sonic put a big stupid smile on my face. Unfortunately things fell apart for me with the final boss. What even was it?

A few other notes I had was that I really think the game would have benefitted with having multiple playable characters. It really would have opened up so many more opportunities for exploration and environmental interaction, luckily the newly introduced skill tree somewhat made up for this as I wasn't stuck with the same, unchanging kit through out the whole game. Fishing with big was cute. The soundtrack, while not my favourite, did it's job well. The game is pretty repetitive since your goal on every island is the exact same but fortunately the character interactions, lore development and overall design made it all worth while so I won't let that cloud my vision.

Despite my gripes, overall I had a fantastic time playing this game. Sonic Team really have impressed me, and dare I say, redeemed themselves. I really look forward to what the future holds for this franchise that is so important to me. I feel confident in saying that it's in good hands.

Sonics back.",,
"Incredible game, despite it's flaws the game is amazing",,
SONIC !! also i love knuckles hes so cool,,
"This is the first time I've actually played a sonic game in almost a decade. I've always sat from the sidelines and just been disappointed about games like Forces. I'm not usually one to play singleplayer games either. With that in mind, I adored my time with this game, I truly enjoyed it and did not want to stop playing. I have a few criticisms but I have confidence that Sega is taking the right steps and will listen to fans to improve future installments!

Positives / Pros
Open worlds are very fun and interesting! The first island is more rainy at time, but I love the weather elements. There are really intricate details when it's raining as well! An example is the reflection on some of the platforms when wet, just a wonderful detail.
Frontiers doesn't do-away with the normal level formula. For those who aren't sure on the open world format, no worries, there are PLENTY of cyberspace levels. Some are taken from old games, but I don't mind that at all. It seems like a copy and paste sure, but I appreciate the callbacks and them trying to see what works and what doesn't.










Overall I REALLY enjoyed this game, I do wish there was a way to replay boss fights easily (waiting on modders for this) just so I can experience them again quickly. There not a gameplay impact for the soundtrack (physically at least) but it is so damn good I can't get any of it out of my head. The cyberspace levels have a wide range of tracks and each is so much fun to listen to. The open world piano on the first island is just breathtaking. I can't praise the boss fight music enough, its perfect in my eyes.

I think overall I would probably rate this game a 7.5/10.

It was enjoyable through every moment and I can see myself playing it again sometime soon. Hopefully with some mods to make a different experience from the first. I would recommend this game even at the $60 price tag, but understandable if you want to wait for a sale.",,
"I played through the entirety of this game in hard mode, I have literally only one achievement left. I like this game, but it has some flaws.

Pros:
1. Sonic controls well with free cam in open world areas
2. Boss Fights are top notch in spectacle
3. Combat system is a huge addition compared to previous entries
4. The Soundtrack is an absolute banger!
5. Enemy design is unique and interesting
6. The story direction is pretty good and keeps you engaged, specifically in Sonic lore if you like that

Cons:
1. Cyberspace level difficulty curve is opposite of what it should be
2. Collecting stuff can get tedious if going for all side stories
3. Cutscenes lack actual animation most of the time except for mouth movement and idle animation
4. The voice acting felt very lack luster
5. Momentum is basically nonexistent, you can pretty much stop on a dime and a lot of your movement options slow you
down
6. Fishing minigame breaks all balancing for the game, I was able to max out after about 10 minutes of fishing
7. The pop-in is pretty atrocious even on pc
8. A little bit too short for my liking

Final Thoughts: 6.8/10 - Good
This game feels like a very experimental title. There were a lot of steps in the right direction for Sonic, but the game feels very rushed in a few key places. This may well be the best modern sonic game we have gotten in the past 10 years, however, I think that SEGA can do much better and that this was more of a rushed test for them to see what works and what doesn't. I look forward to the coming years to see what SEGA does next, and pray to God that they don't make another Sonic Forces. All in all it is still a fun play.",,

PEAK FICTION!,,
Pinball predates civilization,,
"one of, if not the best sonic games out there. this was truly a good game. i loved it when frontiers spoke out to each titan, and said, “sorry, but this is my Sonic Frontiers,” and sonic'd all over them. one of the moments of all time.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is good. I really enjoyed running around the overworld and repeatedly cutting the knot on several of the friend collectables. Combat feels pretty scripted, but the enemy encounters got better in the later half. UI is kind of frustratingly slow/cumbersome. I actually did enjoy most of the cyber-space stages, especially the ones that were using setpieces ideas from previous games, but with their ""retro"" level assets.",,
"Gameplay
I have played through the first island (though not 100% yet) and so far I've had a blast all the way through. This is probably the best handling for any 3D sonic game so far. It has managed to combine the precise control of the adventure era games with the amazing sense of speed and power of the boost era games. The controls are further helped by allowing you to adjust speed and turning speed, and you can independently vary this for normal and boost running. I turned everything to max as I like twitchy gameplay and am very accustomed to SA1 and SA2 which demand a greater level of control from the player, but if that's proving difficult for you, turning down these settings can make the platforming easier. Its a great design decision that really broadens the scope for player satisfaction, and being able to do it on the fly means you can adjust to circumstances if needed as well (Turn down speed and increase turning speed if you need to do some precise platforming, or just turn everything to 11 if you want to have run around).
The open world areas are brilliantly designed, rewarding exploration, full of side quests to do and with plenty of collectables. A particular highlight for me was collecting the Kocos. If you stand still for a while, all the ones in your inventory will pop up and face sonic. As you run around them they will turn to face you. The Kocos are super cute, giving me stone Chao vibes, and being able to see how many you have collected is just fun. I had a blast just seeing how many I could get on screen at once.
I am pleased to say that Cyberspace levels are fun as well, playing more like traditional boost era games. Sonic does feel like he is up against more resistance as he runs in these stages, but it doesn't make sonic slow, rather it makes you work for that speed (whereas in previous iterations the boost just got you to max speed immediately, its a bit more limited here. I don't prefer either (Boost era were a lot of fun for giving you super power all the way), but this works really well in this game. It should be made clear that the cyberspace levels aren't the main bulk of the gameplay like you may expect in Adventure or unleashed, with the open world areas just being hubs. They are more like bonus levels and only last a few minutes each. They are fun, feel different to the main game, and comprise maybe 10% - 15% of gameplay.
The combat is also great. It adds just enough complexity to Sonics tried and tested homing attack formula, while not overcomplicating and still staying true to the feel of Sonic games from Adventure onwards. The big highlight though is the amazing boss battles. They are huge and invite you to scope them from afar to find the right approach to fighting them, whilst also affording the option to retreat if the battle isn't going well.10/10

Presentation
The game looks gorgeous. The landscapes are vast and beautifully drawn, colours are vibrant, you can see miles in the distance, reflective surfaces everywhere and everything runs smoothly. I'm playing on max settings at 4k (recoding with the AMD software at 1080p), and still seem to be getting a solid framerate. There is some detail pop in that is quite visible, but thats more or less required on a game this size and speed. It would have been nice to have a few more customisation options, even if my GPU couldn't handle it. Nevertheless, since my HW is quite old now, running at good FPS at max settings and res shows this is very well optimised. The soundtrack and sound effects are very nice as well. In combat, the sound of hitting the enemies gives a real feeling of force and adds to the enjoyment. Standard Sonic fare is here as well, with ring sounds, NPCs make cute noises in theme with the world, destroying boxes makes satisfying crashing noises, you can hear the crass rustle under sonics feet as he runs through it. Everything combines to make the world feel alive. The music is more sparse in the open zones, but what you get is wonderfully composed and helps immerse you in the experience. Sonics more rocky 3D era songs are still present as well, but only come in during cyberspace levels or boss fights, which helps in building spectacle for the player and, for me personally, improves my enjoyment.

Story
The story seems to be striking a balance, with a overall serious tone, but not devoid of cartoony elements to lighten the mood. I haven't progressed far enough to reach any conclusions, but what has been presented so far has been of a high standard. It is yet to be seen if this can beat the story in Unleashed.

Overall: A great game, I still have to finish it, but its certainly looking like one of the best Sonic games ever released. Strongly recommended.",,
"NON SPOILER REVIEW!

Sonic Frontiers is definitely a contender for the best Sonic game ever. Having completed this on Switch and playing on Steam and Xbox currently, I've been having a lot more fun with this game than ever before. It is an amazing game that everyone should at least definitely try.

With that being said, as a non-spoiler review, the story of this game is one of the best parts of Sonic Frontiers. Yes, you heard me right. The story for Sonic Frontiers is actually on par with stories from Sonic Adventure 2 and Sonic Unleashed. Ian Flynn actually surprised me with how good the story is. The characterizations of Sage, Sonic, and Eggman are among my favorites, same with Tails. SEGA, Sonic Team, from now on, Ian Flynn is a MUST for future Sonic titles going forward. His work on IDW is among the best with writers like Evan Stanley of the mainline IDW stories and Daniel Barnes of Scrapnik Island. The ending is a bit meh though.

The gameplay is another great part of Sonic Frontiers. The controls are very smooth and responsive. And best part, you can customize it in the settings! Same doesn't go for the other versions sadly. Boost being on the right trigger, whether I like it or not, was actually a very smart decision. It works best with the camera on the right stick, because hitting X for boosting and turning with the camera just wouldn't feel all that great in my opinion. The combat for this game is actually outstanding. It may not be on par with combat systems from Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, but it's still amazing to watch Sonic pull off crazy as hell combos with the Skill Tree that is accessible from the get-go. Cyber Space is ok at best for me, but not everyone would agree with me. There are missions you do when you play Cyber Space, like collecting a certain number of rings and getting all the red star rings. The ranking system for Cyber Space is based on time. The faster your time, the better the rank will be, and honestly, this is one of my favorite ranking systems besides Sonic Adventure 2 and Sonic Unleashed.

The soundtrack is the best part of Sonic Frontiers for me. No matter which way you put it, heavy metal songs in general for Sonic the Hedgehog is a MUST from now on. The soundtrack has a more mysterious but hardcore vibe to it all, and it's even better with a vocalist such as Kellin Quinn from Sleeping with Sirens. The titan boss fights are among the best bosses Sonic has ever gotten. Long gone are the Eggman boss fights from Sonic Colors onward. The Titans are the peak of Sonic boss fights.

And finally, one of the other greatest parts of Sonic Frontiers is the fishing minigame. I'm sorry, but Sonic Adventure's Big's Fishing levels have NOTHING on this minigame. It is actually more fun and it is a great pastime and way to get the Vault Keys besides going into Cyber Space.

Now there are a few negatives for me about this game. The Cyber Space physics and controls are the worst part of the game. They are not on the same level as Open Zone, and I kinda wished it was, because you cannot fully control Sonic sometimes while playing through these linear stages. The reused assets are not really a problem for me, but Green Hill and Chemical Plant are REALLY unnecessary. Sky Sanctuary is ok, and the new city theme is very interesting. The next negative is the Elder Koco. No matter how much you bring Koco to him, you only level up your speed or ring capacity ONCE. EVERY SINGLE TIME. It is very frustrating and slow. The Hermit Koco is so much better with levelling up. The next negative is the 4th island, Rhea Island. It is so barren and empty in features in other better islands such as Kronos, Ares, Chaos, and Ouranos that it feels SO underwhelming. It is a very short island and it doesn't take long to 100% the island. One of the minor inconveniences is the buggy camera. Sometimes when you enter a certain area in an island, it'll go from a 3D axis to a 2D axis and while not bad, the camera trying to get out of the 2D axis is very annoying to deal with. One final negative is the lack of a Photo Mode, but honestly, this could be in a future patch or DLC release. Photo Mode would've been such an interesting inclusion. Just something Sonic Team should have for more Open Zone games going forward.

TL;DR, Sonic Frontiers is an amazing experience. It'll vary between each person, but if you want a long Sonic game with a great atmosphere and story, with the best soundtrack and best gameplay, I HIGHLY recommend you play this game. It is an amazing game that everyone should give a try at LEAST once. If you like it, you may replay it a bunch of times. If you don't really like it, that is completely fine. Overall, Sonic Frontiers is objectively a great game. Don't let anyone else try to make fun of you for enjoying the game.",,
"It reminds me a lot of adventure. You do stuff in an overworld and get to do levels in certain sections. The only difference is the overworld is a lot more fun. The upgrading system is good, the way sonic can move through the world is fun, and there's a really good fishing minigame. It's probably my favorite Sonic game so far.",,
"Sonic Team said and I quote ""Experience Sonic like never before!""
Boy howdy I sure did experience something.
Quite possibly the best Sonic game in the past decade or two now perhaps? I lost count...
It has some minor issues and some sections are a bit same-y.
But the story... yes... please keep Ian Flynn writing the games SEGA!
Also the music slaps.
Also top 10 anime moments.
Good game, I have experienced Sonic.",,
"(NOTE: This review focuses mostly on the game! I do not cover the story here, but I will say I love it and it's best experiencing it blind!)

The past few years, mostly after Mania/Forces, have been pretty cut-and-dry in regards to truly standout game releases, Mania was honestly the last time I felt absolutely giddy about a Sonic game, and that was in 2017, plus we all know what happened with Forces and the effect it left on fans, which I still think is pretty dumb, but I won't get sidetracked about that. Point is, I'm happy to say that Sonic Frontiers reignited that feeling once again in its own way. I've played through the campaign and 100%'d it in about 21 hours, and I can confidently say that this is definitely one of the most fun and enjoyable Sonic games I've played in quite some time, although like many games, it ain't a perfect 10.



First off, the islands, or 'open zones' as the devs love to call it. The game is split into 4 islands (Kronos, Ares, Chaos, and Ouranos), with 1 additional area (Rhea) used primarily for story beats. The open-zone gameloop consists mainly of you exploring around as Sonic, with most of his abilities from past games, with the goal of collecting several different important items to advance to the next objective, and you can handle this goal in a multitude of different ways. There are character memory tokens which are used to progress through the 'side-stories' of each island's respective character, Portal Gears that you obtain from the Guardian minibosses, and Vault Keys, which you mainly get from 'Cyberspace' levels, they're the big important m'guffins that unlock each of the 7 Chaos Emeralds. The gameloop can be considered repetitive to some, but I'd say the campaign manages pretty fine with it, since you're often doing different things along the way in each island whilst pursuing the goal. Sonic's controls in the open-zone are GODLIKE, and they honestly trounce over every single Boost game by a long shot, even the really good ones. It helps that it's also customisable with different sliders in the game settings, however I cranked them up to the max, and still, Sonic felt super good to control. He also has extra moves like Mania's drop dash (which has slope momentum wowww we can shut up about it now!!), and even somewhat of a return of the bounce bracelet from SA2. There's also a few minigames that you do in these open-zones to advance the story, there are some which are okay, like those space-shooter sections, and some that are REALLY bad, like Chaos Island's pinball minigame. I wish some of these weren't really mandatory, or at least made less egregious as it kinda pulls a 'Wrath of Cortex' by making you play this completely different gameplay style to get back to the open-world action platformer you paid money for, and that's not something I like very much in games like this. There is also the glaring issue with pop-in, which while expected from an open-world game, I feel the devs could've worked to make it less jarring, or increase the distance a fair bit to mask it better. I do hope a patch comes out at some point to address that issue, as it can be pretty distracting on occasion.

To end this on a lighter note though, I'd say Ares is my favourite of the islands due to the amount of content it houses, as well as it having some of my personal highlights in this game's story. It's funny cuz usually, I don't like deserts in a lot of games!



The open zone also features combat, which we haven't seen in the main series since the Werehog in Unleashed. While I know the Werehog has its fans, I personally didn't find it all that enjoyable, considering you had to just rely on QTEs for a good ranking making all the actual combinations pointless. Frontiers on the other hand, has a pretty fun skill tree-based combat system that while simple, is REALLY accessible to anyone and fun to utilise when you get good with it, making you feel like you're pullin' off ♥♥♥♥ on the level of a DBZ character, it's cathartic as hell and I love it. I also liked how most of the enemies were handled in this game, especially the Guardian minibosses. You have to put together different strategies to even earn the privilege of wailing on them with your crazy moves, the Sumo fight is a pretty good example of what I mean.

And the SUPER SONIC TITAN BOSSES AT THE END OF EACH ISLAND? Oh my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GOD, they are EASILY the best fights with Super Sonic that this series has had in such a long time, and a perfect example of how rewarding the combat is in this game when you know how to get good at it! My only gripe though is that the parry system in this game, while I understand why, is way too easy to abuse, as you only need to hold the bumpers down and nothing else, that and you can just stall yourself in the air with it indefinitely which is kind of strange, but that can honestly just be amounted to the fact that I'd love to have a bit more challenge in this game. Not on the level of something like the Souls games duh, but just something to encourage me to be a LOT more methodical with my approach to new threats.



Now for the arguably weakest part of this game. Cyber Space. These are basically the last hurrah of the Boost formula from Unleashed, Colors, Gens and Forces, being bite-sized levels (with the occasional long one) that almost feel like Special Stages in some form, and they're often the main way of earning Emerald Vault Keys. The idea of small boost levels as little challenge stages is a great idea and honestly worth keeping so that traditional Sonic stage gameplay can be preserved in some form in this new age and new formula, but Frontiers' execution of this idea could've been handled a lot better in my eyes.

First off, the controls. They are not as smooth as the open zone, which while I understand the sliders can change a lot, the way they made Sonic control in these stages is so jarring in comparison, his turning arguably being worse here than in Forces which was pretty bad to begin with.

Secondly, the aesthetics. Everyone has harped on for a while about how sick they are of the levels from the classic games constantly being used in recent games since Gens, e.g. GHZ, CPZ, SSZ. I personally never cared for it, but I can understand when it's tiring to see the same thing over and over again. There WAS one original aesthetic though in this game, which was the highway theme, and I loved all of those and wished they had more spotlight, as I don't think you see them as much as the other three.

Thirdly, some of the level designs themselves. Some of the level designs they picked were pretty fun to go through, like the Sky Rail and Green Forest homages, but there were some major stinkers as well, like 1-2 for his inconsistently strict S rank time, or 3-6, which was basically themed after one of those REALLY hard Unleashed DLC levels, I had to replay several times to get the S on that one.

For the future, if they plan on exploring this idea again which I hope they do, I'm not too fussed about them using past level designs, but it's not as fun going through them with a Sonic that doesn't control as greatly as he did back when those old level designs were new in their debut games. I'd also say expand on the varying aesthetics. Four themes is such a small range for such an amazing concept.



Overall, this game's a strong 8.5/10 for me. This is a great first shot at a new formula, and I hope to look forward to future games with this new foundation in mind. Damn good job, Sonic Team, you pulled through.",,

"Been a big fan of Sonic games since ""Sonic The Hedgehog"" on Megadrive in 1991, I've been playing the Sonic collection ever since (Sonic, 2,3, S&K, SA1/2, Origins, Mania, etc).
I'm early in the game (halfway through the second island), but so far I've enjoyed it greatly.
Gameplay is fun, open world is a refreshing experience from the linear platformer. The throwbacks and references to previous games keep putting a nostalgic smile on my face.

It does have its problems, especially with slower action and control precision at times, but I don't feel that takes away from the fun experience it provides.
The challenges definitely increase the replayability of the game, always trying to reach the elusive S-Rank.
Graphics are really good.

Definitely would recommend to anyone who enjoys a speedy adventure.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is a solid game, but an even better Sonic game. Even if you aren't a fan of Sonic you can definitely find yourself having fun running through the zones, grinding on rails, platforming, and beating enemies. It is not perfect by any means. Sonic can feel clunky platforming at times, but when compared to past games I wholeheartedly think they have improved. The story is amazing, and just the writing in general for the characters. I think that alone is what makes me love this game, and its possibly my favorite in the whole series. Music in this game is quite literally ear candy. Ohtani really knocked it out of the park, and I can't get enough of these tracks. The boss fights are incredible through and through. This game is a breath of fresh air for Sonic fans.",,
"If you are a 3d sonic fan, ignore the rest of this review, buy the game, it's the best thing we've gotten in a decade. However if you are iffy or even haven't played 3d sonic, I can offer some wise words to maybe sway your purchase. This is one of the strongest 6/10 video games ever made. The soundtrack is legendary with tons of tracks containing vocals, fantastic boss themes, and catchy level themes. The gameplay is improved compared to older 3d sonic games of the modern era (known as the ""Boost"" games) but it falters in it's crappy open world design. Sonic just doesn't feel very good in the open world, he's too slow sometimes, and too fast when you are trying to precise platform. They gave him a double jump this time around which makes things a lot better compared to other recent outings. The story references old sonic games tastefully but in a way that a big fan would be overjoyed to hear talked about. The writing is SURPRISINGLY GOOD!!! The ""cyberspace"" levels are just not very good, unfortunately, they are too short, recycle assets from 3d sonic games going back to Unleashed, and generally feel pretty lazy. And the overworld puzzles become tedius by the second island of the game (there's 4 major islands, for reference) The fighting system introduced here, by no means is bad, but it's very simple. Boss fights are really where this combat system shines, and fighting normal enemies in the overworld can become boring pretty fast, some miniboss fights are really good, others suck. I'm running outta things to say but there's some info from a guy who loves sonic games, despite their flaws.",,

"It's AMAZING, not perfect, but it's got the right direction. Open world is obviously there to pad out the playtime between the speedrun zones, but satisfying enough.

"Sonic Frontiers is a enjoyable game with quite a few issues here and there. The place where it shines the most is definitely in storytelling, although I'm not sure how much of that is just Ian Flynn carrying the show considering how clowny generations/forces/colors were. With that said, I'll just tackle on the aspects that I thought was good, and then bad after. Although honestly, I wish I had an option to just give a Indecisive review, since I can't decide between recommend or not.


Characterization. I won't lie, this game helped basically all the characters. Sonic himself felt like how he was in Sonic Unleashed which was my favorite iteration of Sonic. Jokey, and serious when it comes to his friends. The relationship he had with Chip in that game was well done. In this game it really solidified what his relationship is all about with everyone else. Calling Tails ""little bro"", the banter he has with Knuckles, and the conversations with Amy. On top of that, I enjoyed seeing the mutual respect that Eggman and Sonic have for each other even if Eggman is too prideful to fully admit it, or say it to him.

Amy I felt got the best of it though. For too many games in a row they always had her be that weird clingy girl constantly trying to get with Sonic. Instead in this game they actually... talked and discussed about things, even on the topic of love. For once she wasn't just being weird because ha ha funny, and I thought that was great. Tails and Knuckles were just amplified versions of their prior selves, while focusing on Tails finally branching off and Knuckles trying to find out how to protect Angel Island/The Master Emerald better.

Eggman himself the Memos really helped with him. Since he wasn't in many cutscenes, instead we got a good look at his thought process through those. They were really good.
Gameplay wise the combat was alright, and annoying at other times, but otherwise it was serviceable. The Islands themselves were also fine, particularly the last one and the first one were pretty good.


As much as I said gameplay was alright, there are loads of physics things and others that were just incredibly confusing decisions. I have no idea why they decided to do all this.
Having to hold forward to boost or run is really awkward, especially considering how much Sonic veers left/right if you're not holding your stick completely up, on top of the lack of momentum, it's so silly just seeing Sonic completely stop as if you weren't holding your boost button. Even after some speed pads, if you're not holding the stick he just... stops. Real weird.
Along with that, it seems that they went all in on the combat aspect, now boost doesn't kill enemies in cyberspace levels either, forcing you to either jump, homing attack, slide, or just avoid them altogether.

Ring Dash being placed on a separate button (why is it on L3?) in favor of that new circle ability. The part that's confusing about this is that one requires a tap and the other requires holding it, so you would think they can figure this out, but nope. Also, that weird complete stop after a light ring dash is... interesting, it only doesn't have that awkward delay if there is a spring or a pad after it.

Combat itself is pretty slow, as a result homing attack, like the light dash, has a awkward delay on impact. So during Cyberspace levels if there's a chain homing attack, it's a real slow process, so instead of using Sonic's ability you go out of your way to avoid it in general.
Jumping is also really weird. Sometimes it makes the correct distance, sometimes it barely goes forward at all so I fall to my death. On top of that you have little to no aerial movement after you chose your direction. Considering they went all out with ground movement, seems a bit much to restrct air movement as much as they did.

As I typed all that, there is now currently a mod that fixes all these issues, but that still involves having to use a mod. Hopefully the devs look at it and see what exactly they did.
I really feels like they felt bad about not using Super Sonic that often so now there are 4 super sonic fights, and they're not exactly... exciting. Super Sonic always was that moment at the end of the game, but constantly losing the Chaos Emeralds over and over... Super Sonic starts losing its spark after the second time. On top of it the camera is pretty wild on those fights, I had issues keeping track of the second one in particular. It's pretty disorienting. That said, side stepping+attack is broken and does a obscene amount of damage. The fights tend to end the moment they start.

Another thing in regards to control/camera/movement. The fact that the ""guardians"" that are around each island always showing you their name and freezing the game. Even when you're just running around 100%ing the island. Special shoutouts go to ""Fortress"" on the Chaos Island taking your camera for a good 5~10 seconds.
Speaking of Chaos Island, it was by far the worst one, with paths not going where you thought they would, it was pretty easy to get lost and... Honestly just not a fun experience overall.

Upgrading speed/ring is a chore. I have no idea why they thought it was a good idea to upgrade only one at a time, on top of the fact that menuing again to select an option takes around 2 seconds. I would say an hour and some change was spent upgrading those two things alone. Just sitting there, selecting my option. That should not be a thing that is happening.


On Cyberspace levels, I did like playing a bunch of older levels again. City Escape, Green Forest, Metal Harbor, a lot of stages are there. However, in regards to the lore, which I feel was added because people were accusing them to being lazy... Yeah, uh, last I checked Radical Highway/Sky Rail (and I'm pretty sure there was a third, I'm blanking) were Shadow levels, so it seems odd to randomly add lore of ""based on Sonic's memory"" then to just put in levels he wasn't involved in. Oof.

With that said, it's also incredibly dissappointing to see all these levels simply reskinned as Green Hill/Chemical Plant/Sky Sanctuary/...whatever the 4th was. City Escape? idk. Either way, I think it would have been nice to see some of the older levels especially with a modern look. Oh, right, the drifting mechanics from the Unleashed level were uh... Yeah, that ain't it.
All in all, I think there's a template for a good game here. They just need to work out some things, hopefully SEGA management doesn't mess things up like they normally do. However, I do prefer the sense of speed from Unleashed/Generations much more than this game can ever deliver. I just hope that they can improve upon it (it's definitely a step up from Forces good lord that game was a mess) and make a better game in the future. Or, hell, update this game with better mechanics/physics and add some DLC levels. There are hints on things in regards to Tails/Knuckles/Amy after all.

Edit: After much deliberation, I decided to change my review to negative as I think they still have a lot to work on, and I don't think the game is worth $60. The pop-ins, issues I mentioned, and the oddly 30 fps cutscenes were enough.
Also added in something else in ""the bad""",,
"This is game is SO good. The physics can be a bit off at times, but there is so much amazing gameplay and story in this game. It also has a lot of playtime, so it is worth your buck on content. If this is the new Sonic, I would be happy.",,
"The open zones are a joy ride for sonic and it gets more advanced as you go through them. I wish there wasn't any invisible walls or sonic can launch himself into the air to get to places but you can still play around that. the cyberspace levels speed kinda sucks and physics can definitely be improved, other than that game is lit",,
"This is now my favorite Sonic game, and hopefully a good omen for things to come.

I still think the obstacle course-style levels should remain a mainstay of the series, even if they're more of a side thing, but the new stunt park-esque direction is an excellent way to get players to actually utilize Sonic's key defining feature: His speed. Not just to ""go fast"", but to aid in movement and just ""do cool parkour.""

The story is quite strong as well, though mostly caters to people who have been with the franchise for a long time. While that helps the game's case for me and other Sonic fans, I can see that confusing newcomers. I wouldn't say you HAVE to be a Sonic fan to appreciate it, but if you're on the fence, maybe wait for a sale.

If you're a Sonic fan: Get this game. You will be doing yourself a disservice otherwise. If you're new, maybe look at videos and see if you're interested, noting that I and many others highly recommend this game on the gameplay alone, and what this new direction means for the future of the franchise.",,
"If you like Sonic, but have been disappointed or meh with the past few titles, you need to give this a go. it's still got some clunk and rough edges, but overall, this game is fun.

Sonic controls beautifully and the big open world areas are fun to explore. the floating rails and platforms aren't too out of place when they are all condensed close to each other. the more traditional sonic levels are short, but fun. Some of them are even hard to get an S rank on, forcing you to find corners to cut when you play the level.

The combat is fun and varied without being boring or overly complicated. it gets the job done and they throw interesting enemies at you to use them on.

The story is pretty basic and easy to follow, but you get some good conversations between Sonic and his friends. Amy shows that she's more than just a raving Sonic fan girl, and knuckles shows off his knowledge of ancient ruins.

Overall, this game feels like a step in the right direction for Sonic Team, I haven't had this much fun in a Sonic game since Generations.",,
"One of the few games where I can comfortably say the entire experience is a solid 7/10.
I'd only recommend getting this on a sale unless you're really into Sonic games.

Things I'm not too fond of:
- The absurd amount of pop-in
- The inconsistent run speed between Cyber Space levels
- How janky Sonic's movement in the air is

Personal highlights for me are:
- The length of the Cyber Space levels (Mostly short and sweet)
- The music when you fight the titans
- The titan fights themselves
- The Hard mode exclusive boss (The only challenging fight in the game)
- Eggman & Sage's Father/Daughter relationship",,
"Roughly 15 Hours of Main Story Gameplay
Low 7/10, but...

Honestly, as much as I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ love this game and as much as my inner Sonic fanboy doesn't want to admit it...
Sonic Frontiers is a low 7/10, barely making the mark. Heck, after the , I'd give it a 6.5/10 but up until then it's a 7/10.

It's 100% absolutely the best Sonic game that has come out of Sonic Team in the last 10 years. All of its positive qualities bring it up to a 7, but the negatives affect it a lot too.

Positives:

Sonic Frontiers is really snappy and has really good level design when it's not convoluted in certain areas. This makes for a really engaging gameplay loop where exploring and completing puzzles feel really fun and rewarding when you do it fast and effectively. In the Cyber Space stages, the game even rewards you for being skillful with shortcuts like in the old and good Sonic games. The level designers really put a lot of elbow grease putting together all these routes, puzzles, and in even the game's rail grind travel system. You won't find yourself sleeping through any particular moment in Sonic Frontiers while traversing since it requires you to pay attention or you will just fail.

Combat is also really flashy and the boss fights are a treat for the eyes. When done right, combat feels really fluid and kind of DMC/Beat-Em-Up-like, however there are a few glaring issues with the system once you get to higher levels.

The soundtrack is also very, VERY good. I love every single track in the game and the boss music is honestly to die for. However, my only real issue is that once you start boosting/sprinting, the music gets muted out to simulate moving at high speeds, but that means I can't listen to the boppin' and poppin' beats which should have honestly been one of the toggleables in the game's extensive options menu.

The story is also decent with Archie and IDW comic writer Ian Flynn writing the story. He's a true Sonic fan and makes many a references to older Sonic games and even lampshading a few things in them too. This makes for a really rewarding experience if you're an long-time fan who has played these games and sets the standard for people who are new to the franchise.

Lastly, I'd just say that performance-wise, the game runs great. It's definitely not a high-spec game and can run on a 5 year old laptop rig like on med or med-high.


The combat is very button mashy in the beginning and extremely cheesable at the end.
In the beginning, you only have access to your homing dash and dodge. Your homing dash also leads into a regular ""punch/kick"" combo that you mash Square/X/LMB for. You will be doing this a lot in the beginning. Once you get access to better attacks, you tend to just spam moves that deal high amounts of damage or builds lots of meter, or both. It's a wide, but extremely shallow combat system which should have been prevented had they put more thought or focus on the combat sandbox and leaned into it like in Shadow's Stages in Sonic 06.

Defensive options are also slow the game pace greatly in favor of accessibility and ease. The game's parry system is very lenient, being active for as long as you hold the L1 R1/LB RB buttons. While this isn't inherently an issue, the cinematic slowmo that occurs afterwards is excruciatingly long and kills the pace of the game for a whole 2-3 seconds. It also just leads into a big counter-hit once you unlock the skill and has no invulnerability, making its use cases less general and more specific which would be fine if it weren't for the fact that you had no invulnerability so the slowmo might not be as helpful and cases where you CAN'T trigger the counter hit could force you back to parry to avoid getting hit, leading into a sort of loop where you keep on parrying to survive an onslaught of damage instead of using it to move yourself to a more favorable position or to just attack.

Later, once you start collecting upgrades and get anywhere remotely powerful, you also end up completely dominating enemy encounters. During the Boss Fights where you could be carried through an entire boss encounter in just a few seconds. It's a shame too since the Titan boss fights are clearly meant to be epic, but they get rushed down so quickly once you figure out the highest damaging combo.

The game can also become very repetitive once you become locked behind a currency count or once you realize you're quite literally doing the same thing on every island. While the puzzles/routes themselves to collect said currency is very fun, it does tend to drain the fun out of the experience when you realize you're just grinding to complete an objective. It's nothing like a classic Sonic stage or the game's Cyber Space stages where there's also an intrinsic motivation to play the game and do cool things/be faster rather than a purely extrinsic one which is to go collect hearts/keys/medallions/gears. You can find yourself going back to play a boss fight or a Cyber Space stage, but you will rarely find yourself going back to complete a puzzle/route to collect an item.

My last biggest issue with the game is with the story. While I sincerely liked the story and where it was heading, the execution was honestly terrible and it all fell apart during the 3rd Act of the game.










Sonic Frontiers is a really good game that begins to fall apart at the end. It's a honest foundation for something great, but as a standalone product, doesn't live up to its full potential. It's a step in the right direction and honestly a great game from Sonic Team.

If you're a hardcore Sonic fan or really believe in the hype, I would say it's worth it at $60. If you're more skeptical, it's probably worth waiting a while until it's $40 or even $45.",,

"Can be a little janky at times but the game is fantastic. The new style of gameplay is fun and works really well and it has a very good, interesting story. I didn't want the game to end I enjoyed it that much.

---------Just wanted to add----------

Since they asked for feedback, i'm going to say the cyberspace controls need a bit of tweaking, the pop in needs a lot of work and the lock on for enemies doesn't always work as expected. These don't significantly harm the gameplay but if they were fixed it would feel like a more polished experience.",,
"It's like Breath of the Wild, but with the old Sonic the Hedgehog gimmicks you remember from the old games. Just like in BoTW, you explore an open world while fighting guardians (like, seriously- these are almost the same guardians from BoTW), upgrading your character, solving mini-puzzle shrines, and collecting Koroks (that, in this game, are called Kokos).
You still collect rings for non-specific reasons, fight a ton of bosses and mini-bosses, and do the classic ol' Sonic speed-run tracks.

The plot is forgettable. The voice acting is cringey. The boss fights and run tracks keep you coming back for more.",,

"Look, I know Sonic games usually disappoint but this is really good okay. An effort was made by Sonic Team and it shows. We got Ian Flynn writing some amazing dialogue in here. We got classic stages, we got modern stages. Did we steal from breath of the wild? Absolutely and I love it.

Leveling up makes you faster or punch harder. Don't waste your time on ring capacity. We stole the boss fights from shadow of the colossus. Again, doesn't matter, cause that game is great too.

This game is easy for anyone to pick up and play, but if you are a long time sonic fan you will be delighted by all the references to the franchise's extremely convoluted lore. I'm astonished, game of the year from me. 10/10",,
"I'm generally a 3D Sonic hater but if the next game polishes the ideas presented here we might have a 10 on our hands. Frontiers is a solid game. 8/10 probably. Writing is fantastic if you're certified Sonic Trash (like me). I don't know that it's as replayable as other Sonic games, but I also binged it for 30 hours immediately following it's release. Suffers from ""the Sonic Effect"" where the game kinda fizzles toward the end, I think.

Regardless, the game left a strong impression on me. From now on, when I hear the phrase ""Follow me"" my Sonic instincts won't know whether to respond with ""Set me free, trust me and we will escape from the city..."" or ""I'm standing on the border of everything, listen close..."" and I think that's one of the best things a Sonic game can do to a Sonic fan.",,
"Best original Sonic game since Mania, best 3D game since Generations. I hope Sega builds on this because the foundation and gameplay are extremely fun an satisfying, but some design choices are questionable as in: the economy and therefore balance is broken, you have all the skills by finishing island 2 and the fishing minigame lets you lvl up so insanely fast you become super strong super fast; and second upgrading you speed and ring capacity one by one is beyond stupid - could be patched though.

Now I know some people experience technical difficulties but I completed the game without any issues at all. Not saying the bug reports are fake, they aren't, but not every player has those issues.",,

"When I saw the gameplay trailers I was very disappointed because to me it looked like an Unreal engine 5 demo, the rails in the air for example, who thought ""Yeah, that's good game design"" ? But when I played it I was really surprised, I've played through the first world so far so I can only give my opinion on that now. Many said it looks empty with little to explore and that's all seen from the trailers. But that's not true, the map is huge, there's so much to discover to unlock things, there are puzzles that aren't that good, but they are ""side missions"", and through all these side missions you get rewards to be able to level Sonic. You have to collect gears from boss fights to unlock the levels (old school sonic levels.) But the coolest thing is really the sound, the music in the first boss fight is so great that you get a boner.",,
Its a awesome game but that last boss fight vs the end took so much out of me how was i supposed to dodge those last balls i know you know exactly what i'm talking about too sega you guys are a bunch of demons over there good thing i had dat dawg in me and pulled through,,
"I understand some of the mixed reviews from critics, as there are some technical issues that hopefully may get a patch? But overall, it is overwhelmingly fun to blast around the open areas and explore. The feeling is fun and unique and keeps me coming back. (Which I think accounts for the mostly positive reviews from those who have played the game) The soundtrack is also excellent! I think this is a great jumping-off point for the franchise into new territory and look forward to the next game after they’ve gotten through some of the growing pains with the change-up.",,
"TLDR: Its great with some minor flaws.

For me this is the best 3D sonic game since the sonic adventure series, Sonic in the open zones controls so well that it makes running through them feel great, combat has decent combo variety with some really heavy hit-stop and sound effects to make each special move actually feel like it hit. The cyberspace levels are all made of old level design which is still really lame regardless of the narrative context, It also feels like sonic controls worse in these areas so they ended up feeling like some of the weakest parts, however in the short 1 minute bursts these stages usually last its barely a problem. I think a lot of the mini bosses are decent with some of them actually getting pretty creative at the final island but there are persistent issues with collision on some of the bigger ones that can lead to getting hit unfairly or just generally clunky feeling fights, however frontiers is such a big game that all of these minor issues feel insignificant while playing. I don't think I need to mention music, its great, its hard to ♥♥♥♥ up a sonic soundtrack and I think the new genres they tackled in cyberspace and the open zones worked perfectly, the open zones have such relaxing and atmospheric music which fits the mood of the world perfectly. I also think the vocal direction this time has been some of the best in the series, giving rogers sonic voice a deeper tone took some getting used to but it ended up being his best sonic performance imo, same for Mike Pollocks Eggman, hes always been great but you get to hear a much quieter and serious take on the character as he spends most of the game away from the main cast, its refreshing and works really well. Finally the writing, Ian Flynn being brought on as a lead writer is perhaps this games strongest element, none of this is Shakespeare, but to have a sonic story where characters aren't stagnant, but have actual arcs, and to actually pay respect to past lore is something I would never have expected from a modern sonic game again.

Overall I really think the game deserves all of the positive attention its gotten and I really hope sonic team takes all of the positive feedback, not just the negative, so that whatever project they work on next can iron out the few issues in this one, to make an even stronger followup.",,
"I am not going to lie. The game is really rough around the edges in some places, and I feel a lot will have mixed reactions especially if you are not already a Sonic fan. The combat isn't perfect, the final act is a little rushed, and there's not much to the open zone after story completion.

Despite that, I still feel I was satisfied to the end. Compared to previous games, the story and dialogue has been uplifted massively mainly thanks to Ian Flynn's involvement. The soundtrack absolutely delivers with the Titan boss vocal tracks being the greatest highlight. The beautiful open zones are incredibly fun to run around in, especially since Sonic has never felt this good to control even with his crazy new speed cap.

I'd encourage non-fans to pick the game up on a sale if you're really on the fence. Sonic fans should feel right at home. In my opinion, this is one of the most well crafted Sonic games to come out since Sonic Unleashed.",,
"TLDR: If you like running/jumping around in mario odyssey/bowser's fury world, you will like this game. Not only is running around part of the fun, it is _the_ fun.

Some people say ""the world is bare"", or devs ""just place some rails here and there"". They clearly didn't play the game and you can safely ignore those comments. The fact is, the artifacts (rails, spring, etc) are all placed intentionally so that even if you screw up in one challenge, when you land on the ground there is almost always something else next to you, be it enemies, starting point/middle of another platforming challenge, etc.

If you like me who like to boost all the time at the cost of sometimes failing the platforming challenge, it's literally endless fun. Failed one? Jump hop onto the next.

There are flaws, sure, but saying pop in ruined the experience would be like saying the color of the spoon ruined an otherwise perfectly delicious meal. Can it happen? Sure, for some people. Not for me, and I bet for a lot of people as well. You can watch digital foundry's review on it - the pop in doesn't affect enjoying the games at all. The main game play loop is _that_ good.",,
"Amazing game, admittedly full price is a bit steep for it but I enjoyed every second of it, the first good story in a Sonic game since Black Knight, Sage is awesome, this game is awesome, buy it.",,
"If you wished sonic would return to the ""Dreamcast days"" of sonic adventure then this game is 11/10!!! Im currently on the 3rd island and close to finishing the game *cries*
I NEED MORE OF THIS!!!!!!!!!!!",,
"I was a little concerned whether this game was going to be good or not, but after completing it 100% i can confidently say that i love this game.",,

WILL THE WHOOOOLE WOOOORLD KNOOOOOW YOURRRRR NAAAAAAAAME,,
"i liked it it was really good. love the music, love the combat system. but the only problem is that when you finished the game you cannot explore the worlds again (edit: i was just stupid). and when i die, sometimes it will drop the fps count (maybe its my PC). other then that i like this game.",,
"The best Sonic since Sonic Generations and the best plot in Sonic games (maybe at the same level as SA2). The game has some issues like slightly annoying pop-ins, weird physics in cyberspace and maybe lack of momentum. Even though the game is really good. Fighting is easy, but you still have to strategise a little, minibosses are enjoyable and boss fights left me speechless. I have to admit that I was a bit sceptical about Open World Sonic game, but in the end I think it's a great direction for this franchise.
If I had to give it a score I would give this game a B+
Keep it up Sonic!",,
"Went from looking like a dumpster fire back in june to being my favourite Sonic game

Also the final titan is kinda disappointing, but Cyberspace was better than expected, at least for me",,
"I'm gonna say it, this may be the best 3D Sonic game to date.

Pros:
- Excellent control with customization options for all aspects.
- Huge open ""zones"" with nonstop platforming challenges literally everywhere.
- Engaging combat system with combos and unique moves.
- Low skill floor with a high skill ceiling.
- Collectathon style gameplay loop, similar to Mario Odyssey or Banjo Kazooie.
- Solid story that connects well to previous titles and explains more history behind the Sonic Universe.
- OUTSTANDING soundtrack. Could be one of the best, even without Crush 40 on it.
- Unbelievably high energy boss fights. Honestly, these could be the highlight of the entire game!
- Secret ""reward"" available to those who beat the game on hard mode.
- Decent voice acting that thankfully does away with the typical Sonic ""cringe"" lines.
- Fishing mini-game is enjoyable and funny at times.

Cons:
- Cyber Space stages, while sometimes enjoyable, typically feel like a chore and don't feel like they add anything to the ""feel"" of the game.
- Controls in Cyber Space feel stiff and unforgiving compared to open zone areas. Be prepared for BS deaths.
- Noticeable pop-in in the open zones, although this is common in open world games.
- Having to level up one speed/ring capacity level at a time is tedious.
- Fishing mini-game creates a bit too easy of path to beating the game. You'll see...
- Some perspective switches on the fly between 3D and 2.5D create some jank.
- Randomly hitting boost pads or springs will constantly interrupt you on your way somewhere.
- Enemies that encircle you and force you into a parrying event are THE MOST ANNOYING THING IN THIS GAME!
- This is your biggest piece of advice. Uncover the entire map first. It will make navigating and finding what you need a whole lot easier.

I said what I said. While not a perfect game, this could be the best 3D Sonic Game we have ever been given. I say that as someone who held Sonic Adventure 2 as the GOAT, at least until now.. Can I say that Frontiers is indeed the absolute best, no questions? Well, no. But having beat it and reflected on my time playing it, I can say that I haven't felt this good about a Sonic game since SA2. The story was compelling enough to keep me interested, the boss fights were unbelievable, and it was just non-stop fun doing all the platforming challenges in the open zones. If Cyber Space had been either dropped entirely or revamped to feel more original to the story, or perhaps given more variety, this game could easily have been a 10/10 for me. Sadly with Cyber Space being what it is, and being the best way to earn items required to progress, I would give this game a 8.5/10. Still great, but Cyber Space really kills the vibe for me. Take that with a grain of salt, because I am biased. But I would recommend any Sonic fan play this game. It was incredibly enjoyable to play! Those who aren't Sonic fans may still enjoy it, but I don't think it would hit the same for them. Coming from Sonic Forces, this is a breath of the freshest air!",,
i played this entire game not knowing you were supposed to cyloop the blue checkpoints with chest icons and still immensely enjoyed it,,
"A wonderful step up from past titles, I look forward to seeing what Sonic Team holds for the future, animation is a bit lackluster though and most importantly

YOU CAN FISH AND CHILL WITH BIG",,
"This game has very quickly become one of my favorite 3D Sonic games to date. If not my number one favorite.

Originally, I was planning on making a whole ass review going over points - what I like and don't like, but I have so much to say that I would be here forever, and realistically, not many people will even read this anyway.

Just know, the game is INCREDIBLY fun, and if you're a longtime Sonic fan like me, you will adore this game, it's story, it's boss fights, and it's surprisingly fun combat and open world gameplay. The game truly does feel like a love letter to this 3 decade old franchise. I loved every second of it.
If you aren't a Sonic fan - don't worry! The game is very fun regardless. It might not be for everyone - but it doesn't hurt to at least try it out!
9/10 - An absolute blast to play through, and an incredible joy to experience as a fan.

P.S.: If you are playing this game - PLEASE set the game on Hard difficulty. Either play the entire game in it, or, if you feel more comfortable with it, set it to Hard in the Options menu right before getting your 6th Emerald in the final island. Trust me.

-----------------------------------------

UPDATE:
It's nearly been a year since Sonic Frontiers came out. Figured I might as well say what I think of all three free updates, right? Well, I'll start off by saying this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ PEAK, and while I admittedly gave it a very biased 9/10 in my original review, it definitely deserves that ranking now. Hell, I'd even say it deserves a 9.5/10, or if I'm really feeling generous, a 10/10. Because, truly, I really don't have many, if any issues with this game. I loved it from beginning to end.

Let's start off with, of course, Update 1. While being the smallest of the updates, it still offered some nice new challenge modes, and a much needed Post-Game that the game was lacking at launch. Also Photo Mode. Seriously why wasn't that there to begin with? Also, Extreme difficulty. Because why not.

Update 2 was VERY nice. It gave us momentum and the Spin Dash, which honestly make this the best and most fun to control 3D Sonic I think we've ever gotten. The birthday celebration stuff was cute, the New Koco challenges were pretty cool, and Action Chain challenges were pretty fun! The game also tracks your Completion % per island, which is very much appreciated.

Now, of course... Update 3. Holy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥. They cooked. HARD. And by that, I mean it, this update was TOUGH, as it's actually designed around the difficulty select as opposed to the main game, so if you pick Hard here, you are going to get your ass handed to you. And, honestly? I like it. It never felt unfairly difficult to the point I wasn't having fun, and when I overcame the toughest challenge it had to offer (the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Fifth Trial), it felt so, so incredibly satisfying. This update also, genuinely, gave us the BEST final boss in the entire franchise, and that's a very much deserved title. Quickly going over the new characters, they're really fun to play as! They have really nice variety in movement options, and honestly with the way the four characters are designed in terms of movement, they all have their pros and cons that make them all fun to play. Only issue is Knuckles's glide taking a bit to get used to, but it works.
...now, notice how I said movement options. Yeah, the new characters are really, really lacking in the combat department. Not only are they extremely weak even when at max level, they also just don't have any of the combo attacks that Sonic has, making them feel much weaker and kind of lacking when you try to fight anything other than your common badnik. Also for some reason there's some audio issues on the new story campaign? Mainly related to some Side Story cutscenes and the new Guardians. Not sure what that's about. Either way, this is but some very small complaints in an Update I overall really really loved.

Sonic Frontiers is such a marvel of a game to me. All they had to do after Forces was give us a good Modern Sonic game. Instead, they gave us the best Sonic game in the series, period. Absolutely unbelievable. I'm so, so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ incredibly excited for what Sonic is cooking up next, and in a world where 06, Rise of Lyric and Forces exist, I didn't think I'd ever feel that way about Sonic games again. But I'm so glad I do.",,
"It's Sonic in an open zone, rolling around at the speed of sound never felt so good.",,
The end is a bit anticlimatic but Frontiers is a solid foundation for the next decade of Sonic games to come.,,
Looking forward to the future after this game. Frontiers is enough to have a great time.,,

"Really is the Sonic game I've always wanted, of course it isn't perfect but it's always been my dream to have a Sonic game like this where I could run around and explore big open areas, upgrading your speed over time and having nice combat. I hope Sega keeps going in this direction with Sonic games from now on and keep improving this new epic Sonic formula. Also Ian Flynn as the new head writer for this game was a fantastic choice because Frontiers writing and vibes seem to bring it back to a modern take on the real Sonic we know and love along with the movies!",,
"Is this a perfect game? No. The first two hours has terrible tutorialization. Gameplay has its flaws. Story has pacing issues and some corny dialogue. Games definitely buggy, though nowhere near most of Sonics past 3D outings. Puzzles are a bit too obvious to be interesting and sometimes they straight up tell you how to solve them anyway. And there's a lot of minigames that are a bit undercooked.

What this game is is the Sonic game I've been waiting for for over a decade. The open world aspect may not be fleshed out yet, but given the small team and budget what they did here is phenomenal. Music ranges from serviceable to going hard as ♥♥♥♥. Somehow, they've managed to merge the gameplay style of Breath of the Wild, Bayonetta, Sonic Unleashed, Sonic Adventure 2, and a (somewhat jank) classic Sonic gameplay into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crazy, constantly shifting style of gameplay that works way more often than it doesn't. And the boss fights in this game are jaw-dropping, even with how buggy they can be.

And the plot? This is the first actually good plot since Sonic Unleashed, and the first one that's meaningful and builds on the canon since ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Shadow the Hedgehog. I genuinely did not expect anything that meant something out of this franchise ever again, and for the first time ever, I'm actually excited,, even hopeful for what comes next. I'm kind of overcome by emotion by having this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hedgehog be good again. What the hell.

Welcome back, Sonic. I've missed you.

The game designer in me wants to give this a 7 or 8, but the Sonic fan in me can't give this anything less than

10/10",,
"SPOILERS AHEAD!!

i will preface my review by saying that i haven't felt this rush of excitement over a new game since i was literally a child, it gave me that enjoyment back and for that alone i don't regret buying the game at all. the gameplay is the BEST part about frontiers, i had SO MUCH FUN running around and trying out the combat, and as the first super sonic fights i ever got to experience along with the metalcore OST? i wish i had recorded my first reaction to that first boss and hearing the first seconds of that song and that i could experience it again because GOD. sososososo fun i haven't finished a game's story mode so fast since forever

what i have the most qualms with is the story. i had put a lot more faith on the writers than what we got, the lore that they introduced with the ancients made no sense to me at all times and only left me with more questions than answers, and some of the themes they were trying to inject and the emotional attachments they tried to create with certain arcs (like sage and eggman) just did not stick, it all felt disjointed and strange. what i AM grateful for are the crumbs of good characterization thrown in for characters like knuckles and tails, who have been getting the short end of the stick for TOO damn long. i hope that this will steer future titles to never take those characters and their defining traits for granted ever again. i'm kinda disappointed in how they treated amy, but that's nothing new by now; they did alright but they could've done so much better. the regional differences were kind of insane to be aware of and i'm waiting for someone to translate the cutscenes from the jp dub into english

also sonic had so many cringe, uncharacteristic lines! ""so that was a thing"", ""those sure were words!"", are you kidding? ian flynn we literally trusted you bro what the hell :(

THAT BEING SAID if you're a sonic fan this game will be to you like the crumbs fallen from a king's table, not quite as satiating as the feast on top of it but enough to keep you going until the next supper and perhaps... maybe next time... you'll get a proper seat

PRE-ORDER SONIC FRONTIERS, AVAILABLE NOVEMBER 8TH ON ALL MAJOR PLATFORMS WITH A CAPTIVATING STORY, BLAST FROM THE PAST CYBERSPACE LEVELS AND A BRAND NEW IN DEPTH MOVESET FOR SONIC TO EXPLORE THE MYSTERIOUS STARFALL ISLANDS",,
sonic is BACK bro,,
good,,
"It's really fun and yes, it has it's details, just like every other open world game. I believe that if you wanted a GOOD 3D Sonic game, this is it, you finally got it. Getting used to the controls - if you don't remember the last time you played a 3D sonic game (Like I did) - is a fun task, once you get the use of it, you finally feel like punching everything arround you, the combat it's, well, classic button mashing and sonic homing attacks, it feels good, once you learn how to do some combos foes will have no chance. Graphic wise it's ok, looks good but it's obviously difficult to make a fast Blue blur run at fast past without sacrificing the fully loaded world, it has pop ups, yes, are they unbearable? Not really, they seem like a way of thinking of less powerful machines and keeping good fps, good technical decision even if it doesn't look excellent. The BOSSES ARE REALLY GOOD but - , finally you get to experience which brings a change to the 3d series and a throwback to the classic games. The open world area is really really big, with a total of 5 (4 actually explore able) islands, it feels like there is a playground of mini sonic 3D levels to explore and experience plus the combat, mini bosses and challenges you can find. Also, for the LORE fans, this is great, the characterization maybe the best on any sonic games up to date, with sonic not doing unnecessary jokes about the situation, sonic showing worry about his friends, tails and eggman actually expressing something other than their usual archetypes and more, also there is hints to new directions for these characters, however, yes it sometimes feels weird and it falls into the classic sonic story cliché, but, that seems fine. Any ways, this IS a good SONIC 3D GAME, feels strange to finally type that, but it is, it has it flaws but, I believe this is a step in the right direction.",,
its my favourite sonic game 10/10,,
♥♥♥♥♥ hard,,
"An eclectic mix of Breath of the Wild, Death Stranding, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance, Mario Odyssey, Nier Automata, Shadow of the Colossus, Dragon Ball Z, and Neon Genesis Evangelion. This game made me forget that Sonic 06' ever existed. Its bland open world is supplemented by great standalone Sonic levels. The first boss made me laugh. It was some of the purest gaming fun that I've had in a long time.

Update:

Having now completed the game 100% I can safely say that I would recommend this game, but only if you are a fan of Sonic or if this game is on sale. I enjoyed the game ~50% of the time, but there are some serious issues. By the end of the third island I was gassed. I put 20 hours into the game and I was getting thoroughly exhausted of the open world format. Compounding the issues I had with the monotony of the open world content I started actively finding some of them annoying.

Being pulled out of 3d space to engage with a 2d jumping puzzle every few seconds was jarring and not fun. These challenges would dot the landscape and they were hard to avoid. I also started avoiding some of the enemy encounters especially the mini-bosses because they would often pull you into a 2-3 minute fight.

The progression of this game is also hit or miss. On one hand there is an easy way to level everything through fishing, but on the other hand some elements of leveling are tedious. Leveling power/defense is easy, but I spent upwards of an hour clicking the same couple of buttons over and over again to max out my rings and my speed.

The soundtrack and boss battle cutscenes were good and I genuinely looked forward to the end of each level to see what kind of wacky ♥♥♥♥ they were going to have Sonic go through during the boss battles.",,
"This is an amazing Sonic game for Sonic fans. The story and dialogue is beautifully written thanks to Ian Flynn, the gameplay is really fun and addicting (most of the time), and the environments look outright gorgeous. For newcomers or non-fans though, it's an alright experience, though most likely not worth $60.

However, as with most Sonic games, I really recommend using a few mods to alleviate some glaring issues. Specifically, Showin's Momentum Tweaks, No Hitstop, and Elder Koco Fixed are the ""must have"" mods that'll make this game truly shine. The game is great without it, but these mods make it (in my opinion) even better.",,

I still had a ton of fun playing the game regardless. Dunno how they managed to make a game that feels so jank but still managed to stay fun all the way through.",,

Sonic go broooom speeedy boii,,
can't believe sega actually managed to make a good sonic game again,,
"One of, if not the best Sonic game in the entire series. I'm genuinely surprised by how much fun this game is. As someone who's been a Sonic fan for almost all my life, I'm so happy to say that Sonic is finally back, and better than ever too. The gameplay is not only fun, but addictive as well. Some people might at first glance take a look at the gameplay and think that the world is empty, but that's absolutely not the case. There's so much to do in the world, whether that be solving puzzles, fighting enemies and mini bosses, doing short platforming challenges, or even just free roaming around the islands as Sonic. And the best thing about this is that every aspect is fun. This is probably the best Sonic has ever felt to control, which makes exploring the islands even more fun. There is some jank, but it's not nearly enough to stop the game from being entertaining and fun. And then there's the cyberspace levels. I was originally worried that the levels would be too short and boring, but I'm genuinely surprised by just how much fun these levels are. They're the perfect length, and it's extremely fun to try and finish all the criteria for the level at once. I can imagine that speed-runners will have tons of fun with this game. The only drawbacks for me is that the levels are only made up of 4 main themes (Green Hill, Chemical Plant, Sky Sanctuary and that one city level), and the controls for Sonic in cyberspace isn't as good as the over world. He feels stiff and way too slow. However, the levels are varied enough in aesthetic that it isn't too much of a problem, and I installed a mod that makes him control a bit better in the cyberspace levels, so it isn't really a problem for me anymore too. And then there's the story. The story was actually pretty good, and very fun too. God bless Ian Flynn for not only treating the characters with the respect they deserve, but also doing his best to flesh out the world of Sonic even more. It's super cool to see various moments in the series acknowledged in the game, and not being treated as if it never happened. It's also great to see Sonic being himself again. I've missed the Unleashed era Sonic for so long, so it genuinely feels to me like Sonic is finally back. And I love the way Ian Flynn wrote his dynamic with all the other characters in the game. Rather than just being one-note tropes like they've been for almost a decade now, it's great to see all the characters being written well and treated with respect too. Especially love how Sonic and Knuckles dynamic was in the 2nd island. It's great to see them being rivals with respect towards each other again. Really enjoyed every moment when they interacted with each other. And now to talk about the boss fights. The bosses were some of my favourite moments in the entire game, and easily the best Super Sonic boss fights in the entire series. They're all extremely hype (with the exception of maybe the final boss), with my favourites being the 2nd and 3rd boss (THAT moment during the 3rd boss gave me major Final Fantasy Sonic X nostalgia, if you know you know). And the music during these fights were amazing too (speaking of which, the music for this game is outstanding, and tied with Unleashed for being my favourite soundtrack in the series. Almost every single song is a banger, it's a massive step up compared to Forces OST). It felt like I was playing a Metal Gear Rising boss, but with Sonic. It's like a shonen anime fight, and I mean it in the best way possible. The bosses should definitely be experienced blind. The only gripes I had with the game are stuff like the pop in, but it didn't really bother me all too much so it's all good. I do wish the ending portion of the game was given more time though, as I feel that the final boss wasn't as good as the other 3 bosses, and the ending portion definitely felt rushed. But in the end, I absolutely enjoyed my time with Sonic Frontiers. It's probably the most fun I've had with a Sonic game ever. After a decade of lacklustre games, I'm really happy that Sonic Frontiers turned out to be so great. My score for Sonic Frontiers is a light 9/10, which is the highest rating I've given a Sonic game. Even my previous favourite Sonic games, Generations and Unleashed, are just a strong 8/10. This game isn't perfect by any means, and there's definitely room for improvement. However, the negatives for this game are heavily outweighed by the positives, as well as the amount of pure fun I had playing this game. Sonic is finally back, and I can't wait to see how Sonic Team improves upon this formula.",,
Best Sonic game we had in decades,,
Peakest of peaks,,
"GREAT GAME
Alright, but being more serious here. Sonic Frontiers is a stepping stone for Sonic Team as far as sonic games go. I love this franchise, but I also have had my problems with it.
Sonic Team knocked it out of the park with this game as its the top selling 3D Sonic game, and thats well deserved.

However, its not exactly fair to call this game the best modern sonic game. There isn't much I can say that hasn't already been stated by the vast majority, but its still got a couple of negatives that are difficult to look past for an enjoyable time.
The very obvious and majorly pointed out pop-in was always my first detractor about this particular entry upon first playing it, but it was upsetting none-the-less on how short the range was+the time it took for the pop-in to take place. Now, I know nothing about game development, but asking for a delay to get this game at the day one 'finished' version was, less than deserving to say the least.

Now granted, plenty of Sonic Team's star players have come and gone in the past, but that does not excuse the way Sonic Frontiers came out when it was finally release time.
Yes, the 'lifeless open zone' remark has already been said numerous times, but its usually never expanded on why it feels this way. It can be stated that these starfall islands are supposed to be vast and empty due to the nature of the story, however even if this was PROBABLY the intention, it fails even at attempting to make it feel it was on purpose.
The inconsistent platforming design clashing against the realistic feel of the overall islands is jarring, and upsetting to the eye. These two do not mix well, and it definitely does not make it any better with how ugly these platforms look in the background, and despite already being 'retconned' by the recent Final Horizons update. I refuse to excuse this anyway I see fit.

Don't get me wrong here, I've been a longtime sonic fan since I was a kiddie in overalls watching Sonic X when it first aired, but loving a franchise also means being critical to its installments when warranted. As ambitious as this game sought out to be, filled to the brim with exciting and sometimes lackluster (In some areas anyway) updates, it still falls flat on replayability from my end. The game, yes even with the past 3 updates we've received, still doesn't call out to me to come try it out some more after beating the incredibly difficult final horizons update, and that can be chalked up to the lack of care that went into implementing tails,amy, and knuckles into the game to the point where they feel like they belong, but I'm not here to go into detail about that. To further explain my gripes with the open-zone gameplay, let me compare to one of my favorite open-WORLD games, Insomniac's Spider-man.

I don't need to go into detail with this example, as plenty have at least seen/played the game itself, but the big difference between these two is the Open-areas, obviously right?
Well ofcourse so, they're two different games, but only one of them feels like the game's open-area was designed around their movement. Sonic Frontiers attempts this, though they definitely did not succeed. While you're swinging through the streets of New York in Spider-Man, you hardly notice just how much care went into the mechanics and level-design for the game until you take the time to analyze what's going on.
With Frontiers on the other hand, you can immediately tell there was no care that went into the open areas as far as traversal gameplay goes.

Nothing beckons for me to go exploring any of the 4 original islands (out of 5 that they were advertising like hell, huh) just for fun. It almost always is for an update, whether its comparing how the base game feels vs the final horizons Ouranos island, or collecting a new collectible that doesn't really do much. The challenges and collectibles in Frontiers does not really merit much incentive to go around gathering, as opposed to Spider-Man.

In Spider-Man, you don't always have to go collecting items, but certain items granted cosmetics when all were gathered, or were just fun little collectibles that turned into a slight side-story. Almost always, they had a purpose for me, and that was for getting skills, unlocking more web cartridge ammo, or tokens to unlock cosmetics.
While the collectibles between games do not have to be similar, they should none-the-less give you some sort of incentive for going out of your way to seek out all.
Gathering all 7 Chaos Emeralds on all islands should've at LEAST granted a super sonic unlock SOMEWHERE, whether it be cyberspace or the islands, it did not matter, it should have at least been there. Or perhaps certain koco grant certain outfits, etc. The point is, the collectibles were hardly of much use other than gaining stat boosts.

Now clearly, nobody reading this will want to read EVERYTHING that I've typed so far, but the point is, I love this game, and wish the next installment has more care and budget put into it that makes this look like amateur hour. The art direction felt it was leaning too heavy on Realism plagued by its less than stellar graphical output. I only wish for the next installment to look about as fantastic as previous titles once used to, but with more budget put into it. Though, if more sonic releases are to be plagued with Denuvo showing it's ugly mug, then perhaps keep it on console.",,

"Sonic frontiers is my dream sonic game, i hope sega keeps improving on the open zone model",,
"Easy recommend, for multiple reasons. It has faults though. Also I don't exactly shy from spoilers here but I don't just reveal the whole plot either.

Let's start with the faults. The game isn't exactly that clear on what you're supposed to do early on, which consequentially makes the first island my least favorite. There's a ton you can do almost immediately and there's very little insight on what actually progresses you aside from the very obvious things you need to do.

Cyberspace is bad. Control wise at least. These are the ""regular"" Sonic stages for the game and they follow the boost formula we've had since 2008. This is definitely the worst boost Sonic has felt ever though, and that's including Forces. Everything else about Cyberspace is good though, music is superb, graphics are on point, level design is mostly rehashing past design, but it's rehashing design that hasn't been rehashed before so I'm kind of okay with it. The requirements to S rank are also not too bad either, save for the very first 2.

The ""open zone"" is where this game shines and clearly where all the effort went. The islands are pretty big, and there are 5 of them, but they also kind of feel bland. There are multiple biomes but the first biome gets reused for the final two islands so it feels like there's less to explore overall. Exploring is fun though, you really feel like Sonic or the Flash running around at such high speeds. Cyloop is also cool as a way to interact with the world and I do hope it returns.

This game is tied with Generations for me as my favorite though, and that is for two primary reasons. The story and the bosses. So, starting with the bosses, they are all Super Sonic fights. This seems like it would be repetitive, but honestly I lived for these fights after experiencing that first one. I could not put the game down because I wanted to play the next boss and I wanted the story to progress. These are the most hype Super Sonic fights in this franchise's entire history. They have moved the bar for Super Sonic fights so much higher that I fear they won't reach it again. The music, the speed of the action, the cinematics, the finishers. It's all beautiful. Plus for me seeing Super Sonic actually talk to people right after is fun, since he normally doesn't.

Finally, the story. I'm gonna try not to spoil things, but it's definitely written by a fan of the series, specifically a fan that wants the overall lore to move forward. Ian Flynn, the writer for the comics, wrote the dialogue for this game and it makes every character so much more likable than any previous game. This is my favorite story in the franchise. It also seems like they took Sonic twitter saying ""everything is canon"" literally, but it feels cohesive. They reference past games and shows a lot, which I thought wouldn't feel right given how wildly the world in this franchise has changed just between each game, but it feels natural. I can believe this Sonic is the same Sonic that took down Dark Gaia or Chaos or the Deadly Six. It actually makes me angry about the writing for Generations. If we had this team writing for Generations, I feel like the lore of the series would be in an extremely different spot today.

Either way, this game puts Sonic in a great spot and I hope Sega doesn't mess it up. I do think $60 is slightly too high for it. Maybe wait for a sale or price drop, but I wouldn't feel bad buying it at like $50. Like I said at the beginning, easy recommend.

Edit: With mods this game is amazing. Recommend the ""Showin's Momentum Tweaks"" mod to make the open world more fun to traverse.

Edit 2: With the 3 major content updates this becomes an entirely different beast. This is peak Sonic the Hedgehog, and officially my favorite Sonic game of all time.",,

Definitely a step in the right direction. Sonic fans deserve it after five years lol.,,
Gotta go Fast,,
Hands down the best sonic game since Sonic Adventure 2. Im blown away with the game play it feels amazing and the story is very well done. The missions are also a good touch on all surfaces of Sonic fans from the original 2D style to the more iconic Sonic Adventure missions. All come neatly packed with plenty of fun! SEGA PLEASE expand on this idea of the Sonic Franchise! THIS is what die hard sonic fans have been asking for! Sonic Mania was great as well! KEEP IT GOING!!,,
"I have this game on Xbox Series S also so be aware my hours are much more than stated.

If you are wondering why critical reviews for this game are so divisive, it's really just because it comes down to whether or not you enjoy the movement itself. While the game has fighting and numerous mini games and other breaks to the main gameplay, the vast majority of your time will be spent running around at ludicrous speeds, grinding and jumping off ramps and springs. The movement feels like a standard 3d platformer was imbued with magical Tony Hawk powers, if you are content to just run around and jump off stuff then you're gonna have a good time with this game.

The game rewards you for running around and making you own fun by giving you a constant stream of collectibles, making the collectible pacing closer to Super Mario Galaxy than Breath of the Wild. There is little pressure to collect everything, most collectibles can be gained from farming cyloops, or fishing if you desire, which means there is never really any pressure to complete a specific task. If you are having difficulty with an enemy or level, most of the time you can just run away and immediately find something else to do. This is one of the main reasons why the game is so easy even in hard mode, don't expect this game to be challenging, it's more of a make your own fun playground, and that isn't going to appeal to someone who doesn't have that ""gotta go fast"" bug.",,
"Sonic is back baby!!
(this'll be spoiler free)

Let's get the negatives out of the way first:
The game falls off after the first 2 islands, the 3rd is ok but the 4th is just an empty island that only is there to help tell the story and the 5th is good but reuses a lot of assets. As a result the game feels half baked like this which implies that either sonic team didn't have the budget or the manpower to fully realise the 4th and 5th islands or they didn't have the time to do so.
This also affects the story since arcs aren't properly developed when they might have been had the 4th and 5th islands been fully developed. This isn't so bad that the game is completely ruined because of it but it is still a large drawback.

The hard mode final boss is extremely disappointing considering all the previous bosses are S tier sonic bosses.

The game is janky as hell and the physics are weird and take a while to get used to.

The difficulty is a joke (with a few exceptions), even on hard the enemies are quick to die and most barely pose a real threat to you once you level up and learn the mechanics. I understand this is a children's game but the hard mode should be hard.

Cyberspace levels are a mixed bag, some are good, some are bad. All of them bar 1 or 2 are extremely easy to S rank and feature reuse of nostalgic locations that have been milked to death along with level design ripped from older sonic games and placed into this one.

Now onto the positives:
The character interactions between Sonic and co are the best they've felt in decades. Bringing Ian Flynn on to write the dialogue was the best choice SEGA has made in a long time. The plot might languish a little bit but seeing Sonic actually interact with his friends and the new character; Sage, is absolutely fantastic. The voice direction is also best in a long time which assists the fantastic dialogue.

The combat is fun to do and satisfying, most of the minibosses (and especially the main bosses) that you'll be fighting are fun to lay into with his new abilities.

The bossfights are the best they have ever been in any Sonic game to date and that is a fact. DO NOT SPOIL YOURSELF ON THEM YOU MUST EXPERIENCE THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME YOURSELF!!

platforming challenges actually require you to think about where you are going and what you're doing instead of just pressing forward to win like in this game's predecessor; forces.

This is a runner up for the best Sonic OST in the series, almost all of these tracks are an absolute banger.

The game is visually good looking and most of the artstyle really makes the game look good.

The story for what it is is pretty decent, it's no masterpiece but it's good enough and has a good mystery hook.

Overall I recommend this game, it's got several large issues but I think the positives shine through",,
"Probably the best Sonic game to come out in a while. Has many of the usual 3D Sonic quirks, especially later in the game, but the new additions on top (such as the open world elements and the combat) compensate very fairly for those. Not to mention, if you're a fan of Sonic outside of just his games, then you'll definitely notice and appreciate Ian Flynns presence on the devteam.

...And, if nothing else, you will enjoy the soundtrack of the levels and bossfights. It's some great tunes in there.",,
"This game is a must for Sonic fans. During the 2D era when Mario had successfully moved to 3D with Super Mario 64, Sonic was struggling to follow as rendering in 3D at the speed Sonic needed to move just wasnt possible on the hardware of that time.

It took Sonic Adventure on the Dreamcast to finally make this change, it was a real pivotal moment in Sonic history and paved the way for the next 20 years of Sonic games.

Sonic Frontiers feels again like that moment, this game is going to pave the way for how Sonic plays for next 10+ years. It is the most fun I've had with Sonic in years.",,

"I've been a Sonic fan for nearly my entire life, love the little blue goober. I've been itching for another good 3D game, especially since Forces, which I still haven't played simply because I have no interest in it. Frontiers was a different story. Building up to release, even if I didn't know if the game was gonna be good, I still wanted to experience it firsthand.
Now that I've completed my first playthrough, I can say that Sonic Frontiers is an enjoyable game with some notable flaws.
The open-zones are extremely fun to run around in, the combat, though simplistic and not very difficult even on hard mode, is surprisingly satisfying, the soundtrack bangs even harder than usual, THE STORY OH MY GOD THE STORY THEY FINALLY GOT THE CHARACTERIZATIONS RIGHT AGAIN THERE ARE SO MANY CALLBACKS TO PREVIOUS GAMES AND THEY EXPAND ON THE LORE IN NEW AND EXCITING WAYS AAAAAAA
anyway some of my main gripes with this game are that the cyberspace levels feel rather tacked on, the controls and physics could be a lot better (there were multiple instances of me careening off the edge in cyberspace due to the way sonic steers when making a 180 degree turn in midair even in low speeds) and some of the missions were a lot less enjoyable than others.
from an objective standpoint i feel the 7/10 scores this game has been getting on average are completely fair. there was definitely a lot of charm and passion put into it, even if things don't always come together the way they should.
i really hope sonic team learns the right lessons from this game and expands on the open-zone formula with something better for sonic's next title.",,

Deviled Eggs May Fry: Sonic's Awakening,,
"I have no nostalgia for old sonic games but after seeing them I got the general idea
If this game was bad I would have been entertained, but it wasn't. Aggressive pop-in was a bit disorienting and I often wondered if the distant path I had to take actually just hadn't loaded in yet, but that never actually turned out to be the case and I was just retarded.

The characters don't feel like they were written in the 90s anymore, and there's some pretty neat lore implications if you care about that
And if you're a speedmaxxing alpha chad like me, know that you're gonna die from falling in to something in the overworld if you're not careful, and you'll probably smack in to a rock and go flying a lot.

Are combos necessary?
Not technically, but if you don't practice them and just rely on mashing attack, boss fights are gonna take longer. That's just how it is. Effective combos kill faster.

Good game? I can't decide that for you.
Good Sonic game?
Yes.

Those are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.",,
"After 13 long years, Sonic is finally written like an intelligent being again. He asks questions about the world around him and actually seems like he GIVES a ♥♥♥♥ about what is going on in the plot. His dynamics with all of the other characters (not to mention just how well written all of the others are too) are great and display the history that they have through body language and voice direction (and acting) that is very solid. I grew up with this series and I've been waiting for them to finally return to showing the world that Sonic games can have captivating narratives AND great gameplay simultaneously... and this game proves that for the first time in over a decade. This is mainly about the narrative because that is what has been the most consistently lacking/disappointing part of Sonic games since Black Knight (not including Black Knight because I like the story of that game); however, the gameplay is extremely fun and has an addicting loop to it that any fan of collectathons will find enjoyable.",,

"I can easily say after 22 hours of playtime that this is by far the best Sonic game I have played in well over a decade. Everything about it was a step in the right direction for Sonic Team. The only issue I had with the game was the cyberspace stages. They lacked the proper momentum and physics and I feel like it could've been improved on. There were some great stages and there were some stages that lacked in quality. Other than that, I recommend everyone to sink their time into this game because for the next decade, Sonic is truly back",,
"Let me just say that this is easily the best mainline Sonic game released in the last 20 years. Is it a perfect Sonic game? No. Are there some elements that could've been implemented better? For sure. But is this a positive step in the right direction for this franchise? Absolutely.

Let's start with gameplay. The ""open zone"" aspect of each island's overworld was, for the most part, very entertaining and fun. I really enjoyed running around as Sonic through vast stretches of land, solving a wide variety of puzzles and challenges in order to unlock more of the map. The scale of these overworlds as well as some clever set pieces and bits of platforming really impressed me, not just in terms of creativity but in terms of ambition and experimentation with the formula.

Over the course of each island, you unlock a series of familiar cyberspace levels that serve as little bite-sized challenges to break up the exploration. Longtime fans will likely recognize some of the level layouts from prior entries in the Sonic franchise. Though SEGA claims this was done for fanservice purposes, it does come off as kind of lazy, uninspired, and rushed, especially considering that each of these cyberspace levels has one of four different coats of paint. I would've definitely appreciated more variety in these levels.

Sonic also has a skill tree and a level up system. The skills you unlock for combat are pretty varied and fun to use. It's definitely no Bayonetta or Devil May Cry, but for a Sonic game? It feels way more involved and advanced. That being said, I do wish things were a bit more balanced for progression. Nearly halfway through the third island, I had already unlocked all skills. In addition to skills, though, you also have different attributes: Speed, Power, Defense, and Ring Capacity. When upgrading Power and Defense, all you need to do is just present the items needed to level those attributes up. However, when upgrading Speed and Ring Capacity, you're forced to exhaust the same dialogue exchange over and over and over again, every single time you level up, every single level that is gained. It's very jarring considering how seamless the leveling is for Power and Defense, and is needlessly tedious and not well implemented.

Where this game really shines is the story. Ian Flynn, who's written for Sonic and his friends in both the Archie Comics and IDW Series for at least 15 years, really gets the essence of each character. I'm not really used to seeing nuanced and well-thought out characterization in Sonic games. For the most part, they've been fairly static and one-dimensional characters in older games. Seeing how a wisecracking hero like Sonic fares while being isolated from his friends in a completely different environment and having to adapt may not work for everyone, but I personally found it a really refreshing change-up to the usual Sonic formula.

For the longest time, it's felt like one step forward and two steps back with this franchise, but for once? It feels like Sonic is finally moving forward.

8/10",,
"I thought this game was gonna be lacking, but it was actually great. I agree that it is the best 3D Sonic game in like a decade. However, my only criticism is the need for all the collectibles to progress the story. It's definitely a form of filler for the obstacles to have purpose and drag the game longer than it truly is. It's the only reason the game slows down despite constantly moving (even when going along to my destination, I fell short sometimes, but Big's Fishing can cut time down hilariously). I'd rather play this game more than Generations, but Generations can be finished in a few hours. This one takes much longer as the collection is equivalent to a revised Unleashed style of progression. I am excited for the sequel. Given how the story plays out, they were right, this IS the next generation of Sonic after the Boost Era. I hope we get even further character development to come, and I am glad they can very well expand on this formula to improve it.",,
"Not Bad For A Start!


After five long years in the making, Sonic Frontiers is finally here, and after fully 100%-ing it, it's not half bad. Definitely needs a bit more polish though, lots of weird jank that could be fixed with a patch or two. (Pop-in is very apparent)

The Open Zones are really fun to traverse, but sometimes those random dash pads that take control away kinda hinder traversal a bit. The guardians are really cool, especially those found in Ares Island. Really nice looking too. Overall a good time. (And man those Super Sonic boss fights are just cool, wow.)

Cyberspace is a bit too stiff unfortunately, but really fun to speedrun oddly. Some level layouts are fun, while others are a tad bit lacking. Could be better.

Soundtrack is phenomenal, holy cow those boss themes are fantastic. Cyberspace themes are amazing as well, and the Open Zone themes are great, really sets the mood. Just pure ear candy.

Story was really good this time around, really goes in and does a lot of things right. Characters are written well and the interactions (Especially Sonic and Knuckles') were really fun. I enjoyed a lot of the cutscenes.

Overall, not a bad game, I hope Sonic Team expands and refines this idea with grander locals and the sort, because this is a really good start! ()



A well needed improvement, had a very good time.

Jukebox is a fun addition, although song choice could be better, the are not too bad, although get repetitive after the first few times. And those Koko challenges were pretty interesting as well.

New control options are a welcome addition, Sonic's pretty flexible in terms of controls, and the 100% completion was not too bad either.

Whilst the jank is still present, it doesn't take away from the overall experience much.

They really eased up on the forced platforming sections, haven't seen a dash pad in my playthrough at all, definitely way better to traverse .

Cyberspace is still a bit stiff, but they're better designed this time around, way more fun to blast through, and the extra objectives are a nice touch as well.

This update is actually challenging, with tough enemies and tricky platforming sections (that perfect parry though, painful, in a fun way), which really makes ya put in the work.

The other characters were fun to play as, while isn't the best to play as, it wasn't all too bad. Only wish they had a more diverse fighting kit, like .

Overall, a really fun game which shows a bright future for Sonic, hoping they could expand and improve on this formula and make an even better game.",,
"Product received for free

Best Sonic Game After Sonic Generations",,
Amazing game. Just try it for yourself or play the game on another friends system.,,
"At the time of writing this, I have one achievement to unlock as well as still in the process of collecting every Memory Token on each map which is a lot.

I can say with certainty this is one of the best Sonic games, especially 3D titles. Its a new format, but despite that, its solid. My only complaints are that of the 2D sections of Island 3 being so plastered everywhere. And in general the 2D sections feel weird with this new style.

But what Frontiers does right, it really goes beyond. The traversal in Open Zones is nuts, the OST of 150 songs is some of the best the series has had, and the boss fights just have no right in going as hard as they do. As a Sonic Adventure 1 fan, Frontiers tickles all the right spots, I'm sure thanks to Ian Flynn's writing.

This game is worth it.",,
"After finishing it on Series X, and going through it a second time on PC. I can easily say that I believe this game is great. Not perfect, but still very good. Minor things that can be annoying are there, but it never made me dislike what I played. I just had fun, and honestly that's what mattered to me. Sonic Frontiers has an interesting story, fun combat, and honestly really enjoyable open worlds to just run around in. Sometimes its just fun to watch him run across these giant maps with ease. Its not for everyone, it truthfully isn't a typical Sonic game. But that helped me embrace it more, because I wanted to see something different instead of just another Forces. We got something that clearly had passion and care, and I freaking loved it. I will be pissed if this soundtrack doesn't get best soundtrack of the year, because ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's amazing.",,
"From the perspective of someone semi-familiar with sonic who hasn't played a sonic game in 5 years, I had a really great time with this one.

The story was stellar and gets you hooked on the characters and their relationships.
The graphics for the most part look great, at first I was thinking the realistic textures would clash with the aesthetics of standard sonic, but after playing for a bit, you realise that was on purpose.
The gameplay gets some getting used to at first and can feel kinda clunky, but after a while you adapt and have a much easier time, then after that everything just clicks and the very act of navigating around the map is an absolute thrill.
The music is beyond phenomenal, although that shouldn't really be a surprise as far as sonic is concerned, but this game's score really stood out to me in particular.

Overall, a really awesome game with its fair share of issues. But if you can get past those, you'll have a blast. Highly recommended",,

This is not a perfect game but it is the game sonic fans have always wanted",,
"Edit:
After beating the game I have decided to change my review. While I still overall enjoyed this game, it's hard to recommend at full price. I would consider at 50% discount.

Here are just a couple complaints I had which lowered the playing experience:

Story is... honestly lack luster. Didn't buy this game for the story so I wasn't expecting anything amazing but it felt forced, was uninteresting and was basically ""the power of friendship shall triumph over all"". let's just say Super Mario Bros. 1 had a more compelling story. (The story doesn't affect my overall rating, but something I still needed to mention)

The camera switch between 2d/3d is cool, but caused a lot of jank.

The final boss was more like a mini game. It was fun, but for the final boss? The HP bar didn't even matter as you had to reach the end anyway.

You have to level up sonic's speed and ring capacity 1 by 1. I had enough to to level up 20 > 99 which took longer than it ever needs to. Why can't you just set the amount you want to level it up by?

Finding the Kuco's is redundant, you can just buy them. Finding the strength and defense upgrades are also kind of unnecessary. You can continuously cyloop on any given spot and you would get plenty of them. You could also just buy them. Which in turn makes exploring and replaying story unnecessary.

The falling meteor casino roulette thing is random and covers up so much of your screen.

Advertises as open world with plenty of freedom but I was continuously blocked off from straying too far from the quest marker.

Combat was fun and bosses had really cool mechanics but are too easily defeated, despite being on the highest difficulty. Combat felt and looked cool but I wish I had to put more thought into it. Could have implemented dodging and parrying better.

The best part about this game are the 'shrines' which you unlock in arcade mode after beating the story. Which is really the only part worth replaying.

Game overall: 6/10
Simultaneously both cool and disappointing.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enjoying this game more than I thought I would.
Open world exploring at sonic speed all while jumping off ramps, grinding on rails and soaring through the air is cool.
Boss battles, while not difficult even on the hardest setting, are all fun and feel very involving. Some have bullet hell elements, some feel like star fox, some feel like shadow of the colossus., some have quick time events. All really cool.
For combat you get parries, ranged moves, melee moves, and a combo meter. Something similar to the likes of Bayonetta, not exactly it, but a step towards that direction.. which I think is cool.
The shrines are (as you guessed) really cool. Some are kind of a throw back to a more classic 2d sonic. You can try to beat your time and get higher scores. And the 3d shrines remind of Sonic adventure 2, which again is.. quite cool.
Music is cool, mixture of relaxing and atmospheric to loud, adrenaline rush head bangers.

So whats not cool you ask?
Design and graphics is ok, playing everything on Max. It's not horrible, but to me, there are things that feel out of place (especially the first map). Monster and character design is cool though.
The weird cut scene every single time you get max coins? Not cool. Takes away the flow of the game. Also same cut scene every time you catch a fish.. it's really weird. There are definitely better ways to notify you when you have max coins without having to briefly pause game play.
Story is... passable at best. Haven't beaten the story so I can't say for certain just yet, but I've been asking way more questions than I have been receiving answers. I'm not looking for some blockbuster, tear jerker or whatever but i'm really not following or feeling the urgency of the setting so far. Maybe everything will connect towards the end, but so far it's whatever.

TLDR - game is cool!",,

"While this game is certainly not an Adventure style game, and averages out around 8/10 (closer to 7, but the fanservice really tilted it for me), and of course it's VERY rough around the edges with some issues with polishing (hopefully there'll be patches)...
This is, to me, the most consistently fun sonic game ever made. It is now my absolute favorite, and I can say that proudly.
If you've been waiting for sonic to actually come back, not just be 'okay', if you wanted Sonic to return to the narrative roots it once had, to be consistently enjoyable.
This is it.
The best sonic game made to date.",,
"In my opinion we're looking at the best 3D sonic game since SA2, the game isn't perfect, even a few things I don't specifically like, but there is a lot more going for it than against, so here goes

No story spoilers ahead, though I will be talking about some in-game mechanics/quirks not mentioned in pre-release videos

The good:
Sonic's movement is buttery smooth, as well as being customizable, the way I have it set (everything but camera speed cranked to maximum) made for a blend of Adventure and boost style controls that just work nicely, I'm always confident of where he's going to land when I jump, and it's fun to just run around the open world. The combat is kind of like they took the idea of Shadow's combat from Sonic '06 but made it, uh... good, and added a lot of spectacle, it's not anything ground breaking, but the system works well and makes for fun, albeit pretty easy combat, even on hard difficulty (let's just hope for the next Smash Bros they look at this game and give Sonic a better moveset). Sonic has stats and a skill tree now and I'm here for it, though I did find I had the skill tree fully leveled before the halfway point of the game, which isn't necessarily bad, but maybe they could've either made skills cost more, or made it so skill points could go toward other things after you've leveled the skill tree fully (I.E make it so you can buy items from Big with skill points after fully leveling, or make it so you can level your stats with skill points a la Dragon Dancer's Mask in Sekiro since I have like 80 skill point to spend on nothing) The music is, well it's a Sonic game, the music was always going to be incredible, and Sega Sound Team did not disappoint. As far as the story goes, while it's nothing to write home about, I can really appreciate how the side characters were written, especially Tails who had in previous games lost all his character development from the Adventure series was done well, and they even called themselves out on how Tails got did dirty in previous 3D titles, Knuckles isn't just a big bumbling doof anymore, and Amy has a personality outside of her pining over Sonic. The Kocos (Korok+Chao=big money cute bois) are adorable and fun to find, nothing else to mention there without getting into spoiler territory. Without getting deeper into story elements but Ian Flynn did well by the characters many of us grew up with, which is a refreshing change from the last 20 years of Sonic writing, and if you come in expecting a story like that in Forces you'll be pleasantly surprised that it's not bad at all, despite some minor pacing issues.

The bad?
To be honest there is not much I straight up didn't like about this game
The biggest issue for me, and probably pretty much everyone else would have to be the a-g-g-r-e-s-s-i-v-e environmental pop-in, to be honest (think SA2's culling but it happens in front of you instead of behind), the game would have been well served with a few more months in the oven for optimization, but this is by no means a deal breaker, and I'm sure a patch will drop that alleviates the worst bits of it before too long; most AAA titles come out a little gooey in the middle these days and Sonic Frontiers is no exception to that trend, especially since it launched multi platform. Along that same line, some character animations are kind of stilted and wooden, looking at you, Sonic's walk cycle, and the in engine cutscenes can see some kinda awkward looking interactions between characters, but nothing too jarring, again, the pop-in is the biggest issue, especially when the camera pans over a large area, you'll see grass rendering as the camera comes up to it. Speaking of cutscenes, there are too many, putting the gears into portals has a cutscene, going in and out of cyberspace levels has one, unlocking the emeralds has one, then it loads into another cutscene of Sonic putting said emerald... somewhere, I got sick of seeing cutscenes pretty early in my playthrough, the biggest offender being the ""Sonic has max rings"" one, which can kind of take you out of the action if you're in a platforming challenge and get up to max in the air, since it triggers the unskippable cutscene as soon as you land, the other issue with the cutscenes is that in many of them a few UI elements will stiil be on screen which I found a bit questionable. The game is also a little over tutorialized imo, but this is a trend of modern Sonic so I can't be too critical of this, especially since these games are mostly marketed towards children. The back half of the story is... without getting into details/spoilers, is a little rushed, you'll see what I mean when you get there, but I don't want to spoil so you'll have to find out for yourself. Last issue I have is that the camera can sometimes run away from you when passing certain enemies, one specifically rises into the air, and if you're passing too close it takes the camera with it, which I found a little annoying even though 99% of the time the camera works great.

Other thoughts/gray areas
I get why they did this, but Sonic has zero momentum, man stops on a dime from top speed, it's a little jarring visually, but mechanically makes sense because you could skip vast portions of the game were this not the case, but I'd love to see a ""momentum mode"" post game so you can really romp around the open wo- open zone lol. Top speed Sonic can get flung off low to the ground level geometry if he hits it at the right angle, and I'm pretty sure the trick system was implemented specifically to cover up how Sonic can kind of wig out when you launch off of some things, it's a little weird looking but it's a lot of fun to find spots where you can launch Sonic high and far, or just cause him to ragdoll by flinging him off of a rock. Most scripted running sections can be bypassed if you don't hit the first dash pad or spring to initiate it, this can cause issues with some challenges, but isn't a bad thing per se

Camera: A
Level Design: A
Graphic: C

Story: B

Overall you're looking at a very fun experience with tons of nods to older games, restructured older stages in the form of cyberspace, and a phenomenal OST. I hope Sega sticks with this model of game going forward, and even if it needs a few tweaks here and there, this is a fantastic proof of concept and has me hopeful for the future of the games I grew up with solid 8/10 game for me and I will be replaying it in the future, highly recommended",,
"The game is overall a good Sonic game. It has its flaws, but I've played it through and it was thoroughly enjoyable.

The game has an emphasis on spectacle with a light version of story-telling. Nothing about the game is especially intrusive and it lets you do things at your own pace.

Sonic fans will be glad to see mentions of Sonic's past exploits with an attempt to start building back some game lore. On top of that, we see a new character in 'Sage' who is the most compelling character for some time - let's hope they see a return so they can expand on this foundation of lore further.

It plays and feels somewhat like Sonic Adventure meets a collectathon which also met Shadow of the Colossus. While the world is filled with ways to obtain the tokens you need, you can also opt to avoid many of them if you'd rather just fish.

The story is a highlight. If anything, I would have preferred more story linearity so that things could be structured with more flow without repeating points. However, it does enough to tell the story it wants to and enough to get you to care, while also addressing some past mistakes and finally modernising Amy into an actually likeable character.

And to be honest, I enjoyed Cyberspace. There are a few different ways cyberspace is portrayed some of which were challenging for me, though some more variety from the levels they draw upon would've been nice.

On the side of cons:
- While the first two islands feel rather free, the third one becomes more linear in its maze structures. I would therefore consider this island the worst one.
- Some quests appear to be tied to story and getting around the islands better but these are not distinguished.
- Sadly momentum is not really a thing and the physics and terrain can make Sonic wig out sometimes, but nothing that went uncontrollable
- The camera is not fully controllable all the time. Some sections lock the camera which, if you're not currently attempting the relevant maze, can become very intrusive very fast. Particularly from the third island onwards I kept accidentally getting launched and getting my camera locked so I'd have to backtrack before I could go where I want to
- More story and epilogue. More fleshing out might have been good in general, but especially at the end it feels like its lacking some significant reactions",,

Very good game. The boss battles are so good and the music is very good as well. Totally recommend. It's an open world game so don't get lost!,,
"Best Sonic Game experience I ever had in a long time! Buy it, don't think any further. And I hope the modders go as crazy with this game as they did with Generations.",,
He's back.,,
Sonic Adventure 3 (still no chao tho),,
Somnic,,
SONIC IS BACK,,
Enjoying this game thoroughly. Really wish they hadn't reused Green Hill and all the other classic well-known stages. Sonic fan through and through. Would recommend it to anyone willing to play a Sonic game.,,
"I'm gonna be clear, THIS IS THE BEST GAME OF THE FRANCHISE.

First i want to highlight the good STORY that Ian Flynn and the Team made possible, the characters feels alive with the old personalities from the Dreamcast era + making the story connect with older titles through dialogs and images.

The OPEN ZONE gameplay feels fascinating, customizing your speed is the best thing that could ever implemented, it feels fast even for a Lv1/99 speed. Each island has a good amount of length to explore.
The combat is not that complex like a hack and slash but is just enough to feel satisfactory.

About CYBERSPACE LEVELS most of the levels have a great level design, some of them tend to be difficult than others, the gameplay reminds me Sonic Colors with good platform levels + keeping track of the routs optimizing your time. ""On 2.5D sections the drop dash gives more speed if you are not aware""

LENGTH:
Everyone can play this game, the difficulty is modifiable for each user's preferred style.
You can try beating the game in a faster way ""8-10 hours"" or exploratory one "" 20-30 hours depending if you are just going for the character dialog or all the scatter medals around the island""

SOUNDTRACK: IS A SONIC GAME, ALL THE SONGS ARE GONNA BE A BANGER
But really, The open zone has a calm and moved soundtrack, depending of your situation and cyberspace had different soundtracks for each level, that is amazing.

Conclusion:
I'm really happy that finally the put a lot of heart on this game, is a right step to a good direction I hope for the best and thank you for having the patience to red this review. I'M HERE and I out to play a new game with just lvl 1 stats see ya.",,
"This game ain't perfect. Controls took some getting used to, there were a few visual bugs, and Sonic's new voice direction took a tad bit getting used to.

But honestly, I don't care. I absolutely LOVED this game. So many smart decisions made for this new open-zone experience, especially with the collectibles. Many of the trinkets aren't finite, meaning you can 100% the entire game in multiple different ways. On top of that, there's surprisingly fun combat, and incredible soundtrack, the best writing from this series in years, and most importlant, I was NEVER bored.

The best game Sonic Team's made in years and, IMO, the best 3D Sonic game ever made.

Don't sleep on this adventure.",,
"While it definitely has some flaws, such as jumps slowing you down a lot or... Cyberspace's overall physics and feeling in general, I definitely still think this was a pretty solid first try at a new formula, and I'm excited to see how the team refines this style going forward.

The story was pretty consistently engaging for me until almost the very end, but I won't go into detail on that to avoid spoiling people who are interested in the game.

In the end despite it's flaws, I'd say I have a pretty positive opinion on this game, and I really hope they can fix the problems it has in a future game.

Edit: Forgot to say when it happened, but there was an update to allow you a LOT of customization over the game's physics and even to keep those settings in Cyberspace missions, so my biggest issues at launch don't really apply anymore.",,
"Its actually good

They did it

Highlights are definitely the boss fights and writing. Just so good. It makes me happy",,
good,,
Possibly the best 3D sonic,,
sonic came out of my computer and called me a ♥♥♥♥♥,,
"It's actually good though a few complaints. Denuvo, bad graphic settings and no unlocked framerates.
I think the good outweigh the bad. This is the best Sonic game from Sonic Team since I want to say Generations.",,
"After getting Sonic Boom for my birthday years back and disliking it ALOT, this definitely made up for that past disappointment. I finally have a new favorite 3D Sonic game to enjoy! The music is kicka**, the story is interesting and despite the wonky camera, the gameplay is very fun!",,
"Pros:
• 3D Sonic has never felt better to control
• Major fights are huge spectacles
• Story is not only coherent but engaging
• The music absolutely slaps

Cons:
• Cyberspace levels are bite-sized (but bug-free)
• Severe pop-in on most things (honestly rarely noticed, was busy having fun)
• Awkward pacing at the end

Honestly, this usurped SA2's 21-year streak as my favorite Sonic game. Quite likely my favorite game overall now, too",,
"A fantastic addition to Sonic's legacy that not only pays respect to it, but adds onto it as well.
The story and characters are great. Traversal is fun, engaging, and allows room for creativity. Pulling combos with combat is super satisfying. And the MUSIC... OH MY GOD THE MUSIC-

This game has some downs like prevalent pop-in, some islands being waaay too dissected for its own good, and being a bit top grind-heavy at times, but overall? This game is what the series needed: a new, confident step forward for the blue Blur.

8/10, easy. If you are a fan like I am... WHAT ARE YOU DOING??? BUY THE GAME, YOU WONT REGRET IT!",,
"Okay, here we go. Focus. Speed. I am speed. One winner, forty-two losers. I eat losers for breakfast. Breakfast? Maybe I should have had breakfast? Brekkie could be good for me. No, no, no, focus. Speed. Faster than fast, quicker than quick. I am Lightning.",,
"Those wonderful people at Team Sonic finally did it...

We finally got the 3D Sonic game we've been waiting for. It's actually good. Feels like Sonic Adventure 3.

I already got 40/40 achievements because I couldn't put down my controller and I have no life. I seriously couldn't stop playing it once I picked it up.

Sign me up for the next one, Team Sonic.
Until then, back to Bayonetta 3

Bravo",,
Best Sonic game since Unleashed,,
Don't let this game distract you from the fact that Sonic tried to punch a little girl.,,

"They did it. Sonic Team ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ did it.

They made a good 3D sonic game.

A good 3D sonic game.",,
"This is THE SONIC GAME!

cyberspace is eh",,
"GAME IS INCREDIBLY HYPE. Not perfect, plenty of rough edges, but it's got that early 2000s Sega ambition that has been so lacking for so long. Feels unchained from corporate micromanagement and feels unambiguously SONIC. and it's AWESOME. reccomended and worth experiencing, especially blind.",,
"where to begin, guess at the point. its good, its actually really good. sonic has tight turns a good amount of control and customizable physics, I do wish they emphasized momentum more but this is a great first step in the open world direction. and its not a badly made open environment. its big but not massive or empty. im a big fan of less big and more dense open worlds. in this game that and sonics speed makes for no w key syndrome. as for the cyber space levels wich are just boost formula levels all i can say is its largely past levels but with physics somehow stiffer then forces and slow. i do wish they just ripped the gameplay from generations for cyberspace and called it a day but to be honest theyre not even close to a focus here and account for so little of the actual game that its largely a nitpick that can be fixed with mods anyway. story was surprisingly good. they actually give a crap about sonics lore again and they ditched the cringe for the dialogue. character interactions are even good. the game does have pop in, a 60 fps cap and could look better in some angles, i largely blame the nintendo switch on that one. other then that its got a nice style and is still a nice looking game. there is some jank in the game but overall nothing gamebreaking. a great first step in a long time in the correct direction for sonic team and a surprising w on a game i was assuming would be bad based on sonic forces",,
"So on a whim, I bought this game. My friend was raving about how fun she was having on it, and honestly I was in a Sonic mood. This game gives me the open world aspect that I loved in Breath of the Wild, but the maps and visuals give me vibes like Death Stranding. Both games I love. So the combo with Sonic has been an interesting concept. Fighting the bosses have been interesting and fun. I'd rate this the best game ever if, and only if, there was a Chao Garden. I've strongly missed this considering I'd spend hours on Sonic Adventure 2, just collecting materials and such for my Chaos. Would pay for a DLC that adds a Chao Garden, or even not, let us do something more with the Kokos! They are too precious <3

Please give us a Chao Garden

Will update more when I've beaten the game.",,
"Product received for free

Best game I played this year : ))))))))))))))",,
blue man go fast,,
"This game is SO GOOD. I did not expect it at all to be this good, I thought it would just be a bad game that is trying to be like the Adventure titles but I was SO wrong.

Pros:
Story is probably as good as it can get for a Sonic game.
Open-zone is extremely fun
Cyber-space has it's momments
The boss fights are amazing
People get mad about the graphics but quite honestly I think it has extremely good graphics.
Appeals a lot to returning fans.

Cons:
Lots of people do not like the graphics, I do but.
Cyber-space feels off, Sega was to scared to abandon the boast formula
It feels slow until you have a high level speed stat or try to float around max rings. (cyber space will always feel slow)
Mediocore animations.


I rily hope they make another game using this as a foundation, it is so close to being perfect but is held back by the low development time, cyber space, and some graphical problems.",,
"A great game! Has some signs of lack of polish/slight rush in development but it's a blast to play!
I wish the cyber space levels had better control/didn't feel so similar to forces and colors when Generation and Unleashed did that style of gameplay so well.
But the open zones are so fun to explore, the story is interesting, and the soundtrack is fantastic. A must own for all fans of Sonic and you should definitely consider playing it even if you're new to the series (although some aspects of the story will not make sense without prior knowledge).
You can play at any pace you want! Everyone is going to have a different and personal gameplay experience, and I think that's awesome.",,
I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LOVE SONIC,,
noice,,
"Sonic said ""I'm Here"" and meant it.",,
"so, uh. quickly jumped to the top of my ""favorite boost games"" list. best sonic game in about a decade, if i had to guess..",,
Yeah I like it.,,
"Worth the wait. Every Sonic fan should give Frontiers a go for the storyline alone - yes, meaningful Sonic stories are back, but I think anybody who enjoys action/open world games can find enjoyment here. Some technical flaws aside, tons of love was poured into this one. Hopefully this will set the standard moving forward for Sonic Team.",,

THIS IS THE BEST SONIC GAME I HAVE PLAYED SINCE GENERATIONS,,
This game is pure joy. If you love Sonic you're going to love this.,,
"Easily the best sonic game of all time. Best music,Best Control,Best Story since SA"". If you enjoy open world games and sonic as a whole you will love this game I'd Give it a 8/10 overall.",,
"SA2 chads, 20 years later, we're finally winning...",,
"Best playing sonic game since Adventure 2. Movement feels nice, the customizable speed and camera is a huge upgrade, and is in general more enjoyable then all of the other games released in the past 10 years. Story is pretty good but DAMN the music when you first arrive in Island 4 is sick. Speaking of Island 4, the entirety of it is SICK, and deadass made me think that Sonic was gonna ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ die or something lmao. The Super Sonic boss fights are probably one of the best part of this game. Best Sonic game in over a decade, hands down.",,
"Has its moments of gank, just like every other sonic game but don't let that put you off. very good game coming from someone who has got 100% on it, open world can be slightly boring but all around good and all the cyber levels where fun especially 1-2. great music and the combat its actually really satisfying when you start learning good combos.",,
"This is the best Sonic game. Ever.

It has everything you want. A kick-ass soundtrack, a fun and immersive open world, really good physics, almost no bugs to see, the bosses and combat are all extremely fun, the story is AMAZING, etc. This just feels like a love letter to everything Sonic.

The ONE issue I have is with Rhea Island and the final (somewhat classified as secret) boss. Both are short, uninteresting (in the case of the ""final"" boss), and not that fun. That's it. That's the one thing I think this game fails at.

9.5/10",,
"Well idk about it being 60$ worth but it is decently good for a Sonic game.

My major complaints would be around some of the camera switching from manual to auto that can really be frustrating, the movement in some of the stages can feel awkward as well, like the turning speed being inconsistent, but I think the stages are a minor part of the gameplay. The open world (or open zone), is very fun leaves place for to approach however you want to.

The super sonic fights, why do they feel so awkward? If you ever play this game and you get stuck or frustrated on one of the super sonic boss fights, don't be afraid to watch a video to understand what you are during wrong. (The game might tell you about it if you have notifications on but I wouldn't since I didn't)

What about the fighting?

My fought about it is that it's just there, the platforming is the fun part, the fighting is mostly spam. Note that you can also manually do all of the combos (I had them on auto combo) but most of the time the only real thing that matters in the combos is the move rotation. Some enemies are way meant to be fought in a specific manner with certain moves, but I just feel like it's there to give a purpose.

So the fighting globally, not insane but isn't a button masher either, at least not to get the first hits in.

The character development is shockingly good/interesting if you follow the cutscenes.

Overall the game is decent, it's not incredible but it has it's charms. It brings a good challenge with exiting and engaging gameplay.

(Extra)
A timetrial or chalenge mode in the open world area would be a great multiplayer feature to add in the future to add some replayability.",,
"I've always imagined a sonic game like this, running through a world in a 3d, action-adventure, style is best perfect for sonic. It's not just about holding down the boost button until you reach the goal anymore. Now there is a world to explore. The combat is not just extremely satisfying but it also fleshes out sonic's character, its not just spin dashing or boosting into enemies, now you have many ways to style on enemies with this combat system. Such a big step.",,

"Sonic goes fast in an open world, its pretty fun :D

EDIT: After finishing the game 100% all steam achievements but also everything in the game that doesn't have an achievement (All medals, 100% fishing everywhere and stuff) , I have to say that this is a pretty fun game may not be for everyone might even be a little bit of jank but its really fun. Ian especially did a fenomal job with the writing compared to the other sonic games and I hope he and his team continiue to improve upon this formula because its a really solid foundation for more future Sonic games :)

tl;dr I recommend this game despite the slight jank is a lot of fun especially if you are familiar with previous sonic games and some sonic lore for some extra spice.",,
"While not perfect this has been the most solid showing from Sonic Team since Generations. There are rock solid ideas in this game that are worth iterating on and there's a sense of passion and craftsmanship that I appreciate.

The open world portion has a good sense of flow as you move from puzzle to platforming setpiece to combat to setpiece again. You're usually doing something in these islands. The combat is pretty much DMC-lite, and although mashing the attack button will do just fine, if you're willing to play with the tools given you can achieve some pretty crazy stuff and likely make the fights easier too. The cyber space levels are where I'm most mixed. Early on a lot of the layouts are cribbed from Generations which does not play nice with the control scheme and game feel Frontiers has, but as they move into Unleashed and SA2 content you feel more at home there. I do wish there was a bit of visual variety though; of all the visual themes, the city one is the most appealing since it evokes the sensation of distorted and jumbled memories the best.

The big thing fans were clamoring for was the story written by Ian Flynn, who has been the head writer of the Sonic comics for some time. He does a good job with this soft-reset of sorts; the older games are canon, but they use this opportunity to wipe the slate clean a bit and start fresh, re-establishing the core cast and their relationships. This game definitely sits in that shonen region where it's appropriate for kids but definitely offering some depth for older fans, if the fanservice alone didn't pull you in. Compared to the more corny Saturday morning style of prior games it's very refreshing, and immediately pulls me back to a time I was 12 experiencing Sonic Adventure 2, thinking how it couldn't get any better than this.

I think if you're a Sonic fan this is the easiest purchase you could ever make. If you're not, then I think the janky little issues might stick out, but not ruin the experience. I think it's totally worth seeing why diehards for this franchise are head over heels in record time, even if not at full price.",,
"One of the best Sonic games since generations in my opinion. Sonic starts a little slower, but will get faster by upgrading his speed. The combat tree is shallow, so if you are looking for a deep combat game, this one is not for you. The best part is exploring and trying to 100% each map.",,

- draw distance is not great.
- graphics where better in the trailers

This is a complete masterpiece, peak fiction right her.
Not only is the gameplay amazing, especially the open-zone islands, but the story and the characters are just, perfectly done (thank you Ian Flynn), they finally brought back actual character development, and their proper personalities, and i could not be more thankful for that.

Only downside to this game is that it's a bit rough around the edges, some of the cutscenes are pretty badly animated, and sometimes the voice direction isn't very good. And also the Cyberspace stages have pretty bad controls (compared to the open zone controls)

BUY THIS GAME 9/10 from me",,
"Don't usually post reviews but this game deserves it. (potentially minor spoilers)

Lets start with the Pros.

Soundtrack: The soundtrack is by far one of the best OSTs in Sonic the composition, not overly cheesy as i personally consider a lot of sonic themes to be. really fits with the more serious tone of the overall game and especially the final fight hear new frontiers playing gives me goosebumps.

Character Dev: Each character feels like they have actual problems and emotions, from Knuckles' desperate loneliness to Tails feeling like he isn't worth being in the team, it not only highlights the problems of these side characters but also strengthens their bond with sonic. The dialogue between the characters feels like dialogue you would hear between friends.

My favourite character arc by far is Dr. Eggmans, rather than him just being the annoying main villain, delivering witty lines about sonic and just straight up having no personality just evil genius wants world domination. He starts to feel not like a villain but a person, his relationship with sage really highlights this from being just a highly advanced AI to being considered ""daughter"", the whole game pushes this narrative and it works really well especially with the finale.

Titans: Each Titan fight is vastly different from the previous one keeping this interesting, but aside from the even the battles themselves also bring something different to the scene, from a simple brute who punches you to a sword and shield mobile titan. to reflect back the soundtrack really pops off on these fights and makes the fight itself seem more intense. There is also a big 'bullet hell' theme within the battles that requires a little more skill than just mash buttons. Overall i really enjoyed each boss and have nothing negative to say apart from THE END. wont go into too much detail, but honestly the design was a little underwhelming apart from its sense of scale and the battle itself has no business being that difficult.

Moving onto cons of which there arent many imo.

Technical aspects:
The biggest issue is pop in, now from a dev perspective i understand having object culled in the distance to help things run better allowing a more detailed environment closer to the player. however i can be not even 2 meters away and suddenly something close will pop in. i understand sonic moves very fast so that may play a part to prevent overload on consoles, but on higher end PC's there should be a way to change render distance not even for immersive purposes but would just be nice to see everything in the world for great screenshots.
Textures are another thing, now for the most part not a big deal, ive personally had no problems in any of the islands or scenes. The problem is when im fishing, the texture on the water seems to flicker quite intensely, not sure if its a bug on my end but its very jarring and makes me not want to fish for long.

Cosmetics: My final negative will be lack of cosmetics, despite being able to store a lot of rings at once there is no way to spend them, like other sonic games its just a death prevention item. given that dlc is being released for costumes, feels like there should be a way to get certain cosmetics in game, maybe less detailed or basic themes and leave the great nostalgic or collab cosmetics to DLC. Official Mod support would be cool too

With the review out the way i would give Frontiers a generous 9/10 would be 10 once better PC optimisation comes through. This is honestly one of the best sonic games around, my favourite is still SA2 but this, this comes very close, if it had a chao garden and brought them back alongside the koco then it would be God tier. Sonic team has made a comeback and im very excited to see where this story goes next",,
"solid game, I had a great time with it",,
A little janky and glitchy but very fun,,
"If you've seen my previous review history, it's no secret that I adore this series, but going into this game, I thought that adoration would come to an end. A terrible public showing, esoteric marketing campaign, and vague promises about the game's actual content had me prepared for a game that played it safe, continued all the meta-era trends of self-parody, and ignored solid gameplay foundations all culminating in poor commercial performance and the death of this series.

Yet, somehow, that's not what I got.

Instead, I got a game with movement satisfying enough to feel great running around in an empty field, combat engaging enough to last 15 hours in a 3d platformer, and a story whose heart can be felt in almost every aspect. Does this game have issues? Absolutely. Controls can occasionally result in Sonic doing things that weren't intended, the cutscenes look like a tech demo, and the graphical limitations implemented for the Switch and last gen rear their ugly head at every opportunity.

But the best part? It doesn't matter.

For the first time in more than a decade, Sonic has a heart. It's felt when platforming has a speed and flow unrivaled by any other game, It's felt when these characters show the traits I fell in love with in the Adventure games, and it's felt when the rock tracks start blaring over boss fights with a confidence that rejects the past decade of fear that has held this series down.

I hope Sega takes notice of this game's reception and takes it to heart, and I look forward to the adventures of the blue blur in the years to come.",,
Imma say it... Frontiers isn't very good,,
came,,
Amazing new start to new sonic games,,
"This game is a huge step in the right direction, there were some weird things here and there that i wish were done a little differently or QOL stuff, but other than that it was a really fun time, definitely pick this game up, and if it's too steep a price, check when it's on a sale, for once you don't want to skip this Sonic game.",,
"I just beat Sonic Frontiers and... wow. This game is weird. On the surface, it seems like it's a hodgepodge of random ideas. This game makes both awesome and baffling decisions, it has both amazing and dumb mechanics, and some of its parts are polished while others are rough around the edges... yet it somehow all comes together into one cohesive experience that is so uniquely Sonic. Sonic Frontiers has something that a lot of modern games lack nowadays: heart.

Please play this game. It may not be the best Sonic game... but it's my favorite one ever. Sonic has always been all about a sense of freedom, and Sonic Frontiers is a shining example of that freedom.",,
"This game is a step in the right direction towards 3D Sonic, although it does not reach that full potential that it could of had in terms of controls for sonic it does a pretty damn good job at giving the player a sense of speed at freedom, which is what has been missing in this series since Sonic Adventure 2. The only issues I really had were the cyber space stages, they felt more like a last minute addition to the game and made sonic feel slow and sluggish, but they are otherwise optional so I did not have to subject myself to playing them to complete the game. The story of this game is stepping up to be on par with Sonic Team's earlier great stories, as it had me hooked looking to uncover more plot of this story and progressing. The combat of this game was decent, not terrible but not too technical. but it does feel like the right compromise for a Sonic game. Maybe there will be more room for experimentation in a possible next title. The open world exploration felt great and really enjoyed using speed to get to higher areas or perform skips on platforming sections.
Overall I really enjoyed my experience and was actually surprised despite coming in with low expectations.

btw the soundtrack rocks my balls",,
"I am so glad to say that Sonic Frontiers has more than exceeded my expectations. I had gone into it feeling hopeful, but also a little sceptical as the other more recent games (other than Mania) haven't exactly been up to standard, but Sonic Frontiers is a genuinely great game. Highly recommended.",,
"I'm running (away from all my problems. Please help me, I don't know how much longer I can take this).",,
"It was in this game where Sonic finally came up with his new catchphrase:
It's Frontierin' time
Then he Frontiered all over the place",,
"Ever since Generations I never had interested in the new Sonic games. This changes with Frontiers. I had rather high expectations because I wanted to give it a chance, but also wish for the cycle of mediocre looking games to end. I am blown away! I'm not even that far into the game because I take my time exploring, but I am having a blast!

So far, the only thing I find negative is the air controls in both cyberspace and open-zone. But for Cyberspace specifically, I had more issues with the controls. I did however change the control settings with the sliders, slightly more to the max. It made it more bearable and sometimes I completely forgot about it.

Definitely worth a shot for all Sonic the Hedgehog fans!",,
"IT'S TIME TO FACE YOUR FEAR

"It's good, maybe even great, possibly even awesome, it could even be outstanding...

IT'S AMAZING!",,
I LOVE SONIC FRONTIERS!,,
The characters actually feel like characters and not the caricatures they were in the last 10 years,,
"The game is genuinely fun af. There's some jank to it, but I'd expect that from a Sonic game. The game has a lot going for it and I'm really happy with how it turned out!

Also, the boss fights are INSANEEEEEE. They did not need to go that hard with them lol.",,
"Yo, so like I never thought I'd make a review on another game but man, I have been blown away by this game.. at first I started it off skeptical, and I was trolling it and laughing at how buggy it started off (horrible performance issues, software issue, not hardware) and how I was just gonna refund it.. I played like 20 mins after, and the lag stopped completely, it was so fluid and beautiful and I had just the most fun ever literally exploring every single area to get 100% on the maps..

I was literally in love with the first titan of this game, playing as super sonic was so unbelievably amazing and it was so genuinely exciting to feel powerful.. Imma be fr, this game is amazing, I would DEFINITELY consider buying this, it has its bugs, but they aren't gamebreaking or haltering in any shape.. yes, there is pop in, but it loads up so quickly that it's but a few seconds (or a few half seconds in most cases) for everything to render in properly, which is fine by me.. fighting is kinda interesting, as you progress you can pull of some sick combos and never hit the ground again, which I love so much. The fluidity and speed of sonic is what completes this game for me, as of now I'm only just finishing the 3rd island and I've been enjoying it so far..

but one bad thing is like, the main story, since there's a lot of collecting items, but whilst collecting said items (memory tokens), you can also find Kocos to increase your speed, and the two other seed things to get more def and attack, at level 6 in speed my guy sonic is blitzing across the map in like 30 seconds, can't wait to get that to 100 lmao.. so yeah, if you like sonic (or even if you DONT), i genuinely suggest getting this game, it is genuine fun, havent had this much fun in a game since sonic rush or unleashed (generations to but blehhh), JUST BUY THE GAME :SOB:

edit: 11/15/2022

Just finished this game, and I am honestly starstruck.. I haven't had this much fun playing anything in literal years. Sonic Frontiers managed to become my FAVORITE game in just a span of a few days, from the absolutely amazing and well thought out lore, to the god tier boss battles, this game is literally what sonic is: true speed combined with skill. I finally got everything to 100%, leveled up everything and even did every single quest and cyberspace mission. This game is so much more than you think, you will get sucked into this game and play it for so long without you even noticing. Open Zone is amazing, and I finally understand WHY its named the way it is, each part of the map has so many sonic elements that flows so well together that it feels like an actual complete stage once you get enough speed, you can go to each part of the world so quickly by just following springs and boostpads (which usually bring you into a 2D section, which controls BEAUTIFULLY), this is literally what I needed from sonic.

I can wholeheartedly say that I, a major sonic fan, am extremely excited for more games to follow this 'open-zone' formula. PLEASE SEGA MAKE MORE. I BEG. I NEED.",,
"The games story is amazing, connecting lore form all the games while bringing a mystery that drives you forward. the game play is outstanding, going true sonic speed across the land doesn't take long at all to get from A to B

Though the pop-ins due to the draw distance is terrible and the shadows during the fishing mini game glitch out.

Game play wise this game is flawless. I never thought an open-world sonic game would drive me to explore all the nooks and crannies while doing some sick tricks!",,
"i just finished the game yesterday. this fixes most of the cons in forces.
(most not all, for example cyberspace is slow like how sonic in forces, but they fixed the main flaw of forces in the cyber space levels. obstacles. its no longer easy to get a S rank off the bat. even though the cyberspace levels don't feel like sonic, at least it feels like a proper platformer now, that's one thing that forces laked.

the open zone physics though are amazing. its everything i wanted in a sonic game. not to mention that modern sonic has the dropdash. meaning that at one point in frontiers sonic learned the ability from mania sonic in forces. speaking of clarifying whats cannon in this game comes up a lot and it makes me nerd out from the mentionings of SA1 to eggman talking about the Babylonians.

the story is really top notch and is the 2nd best one i've seen in a sonic game. right under SA2 in my opinion. hell the credits made me cry after seeing the ending after realizing the ending theme was a theme for a specific character (not gonna spoil don't worry)

overall this is the best way to soft reboot sonic, and knowing that our main characters in this game gets new goals further developing their character structure i expect everyone here to look much different in the next sonic game. especially tails for what his new goal is. (again no spoils)

while this isn't the best sonic game it is one that the fans has been waiting awhile for. my rating on this game is 7/10 - 8/10",,

"This game is being played on a Steam Deck.

The last time I played sonic was on Sega so I am a bit out of the loop for sonic games. With that being said this is such a fun game I have been having so much fun exploring the open world finding new grinds and secrets.

If you are looking for a fun 3d sonic game this has everything you would want. Open world secret places and so much speed! As you progress and unlock more skills and speed the game keeps everything fresh with constantly trying new ideas and throwing them your way.

Yes these things may not always work as intended but I can appreciate these new ideas and see this as a great start to keep making sonic games like this.

Now the in my opinion what I found bad was more of tiny graphical bugs or weird camera angles but by adjusting settings I have got a pretty seemless experience now. Keep in mind as I have aged I do not let many ""bad moments"" in games due to graphic bugs or frame drops etc bother me I just came to have fun and the this game is a ton of fun if you love going fast, solving puzzles, time trials, and even some combat action.",,
"So far I am really enjoying it. I’ve tinkered with the settings in order to get a relatively smooth experience playing on the Steam Deck using Proton Experimental.

The story reminds me of Sonic Adventure… but less campy? (If that’s the right word) They went out of their way to say this shouldn’t be compared with Breath of the Wild — but honestly, I can definitely see some parallels. Obviously that game has lots of content and activities to do (cooking, NPCs, shopping, etc.) where this game is more about exploring and puzzle solving.

Running around as Sonic is about as fun as it’s ever been. Especially in an open world. When you max out the rings he becomes even faster. His combat moves are appropriately Sonic-y too. Almost feels like those Dragon Ball cartoons where people fight so fast they flicker around their foe.

If I had to give this a rating, I would give it an 8 out of 10 from what I’ve seen so far.",,
"fun sonic game.
missing chili dogs",,
gotta go fast,,
"Sonic is back, baby!",,
"Very engaging experience. At first I thought I wouldn't like it but I just got hooked. I'm at 27 hours of play time, and have beaten the game. Only thing left is to get the collectibles. My only big complaint is not being able to re-fight the bosses. Only way to do that is to start a new save file which is BS. I did badly on the Wyvern boss, and want to redo it but the only way is to start a new file, and get to that point of the story. But besides that I had a lot of fun playing the game. I would rate it a 7/10.",,
"I've only played the game for a couple of hours (finished the first chapter/island so far) but I will say this:

Given that the last (non 2D) Sonic game I've played was Sonic Adventure 2.....this game is exactly what I was hoping for.

Adventure/Open World ✓
Puzzles/Strategy ✓
Speed Levels ✓
Amazing Background Music ✓
Nice Story (so far) ✓
Complex-Enough Combat ✓
Killer Cinematic Music ✓
Unique Leveling System ✓

I am definitely looking forward to the continued story and gameplay.",,
"I'm not one to write reviews when I'm still at the first part/island of the game, but I cannot help but just express my enthusiasm over this breath of fresh air. I enjoyed every aspect of this game thus far. The exploration is so fulfilling; everything I do has its rewards and it keeps encouraging me to just see what the rest of the world has to offer. I love the ambient soundtrack, whether it's for the open island or the futuristic bangers in the cyber space stages. The kocos are so cute and I'm intrigued to learn more about them. The writing is sooooooooooo good. Everyone is just so chill. And the fishing part UGH it's like the most lo-fi fishing I've ever played and I enjoy it so hard! It was worth buying and playing it on the first day until now! Still enjoying my heart out of it. Can't wait to learn the rest of the story. Good job, Sonic Team! Bravo, bravo!",,
"Absolutely amazing game and a massive step into the right direction especially after Forces. It is by no means perfect but the positives definitely outweigh the negatives by far. The open zone gameplay is literally perfect, the minor and major boss fights are easily some of the best in the entire franchise, and while I can't say the same about cyberspace, I'd still say it is a ton of fun and controls a lot better than Forces which is good! Oh and the soundtrack is probably one of my favorite of all time. It has such nice variety going on yet it's still really consistent in what it tries to deliver at each given point throughout the game. Can't wait to see what direction the franchise will take from here.

8/10 would replay and recommend",,
this game is great,,
Best sonic game in YEARS and the soundtrack is godlike.,,
"Play everything but the last DLC.

Remember, This is SEGA. If you wanted something that actually Functions correctly go play something by Capcom or something.",,

BEST 3D SONIC GAME!!! ITS BEEN SO LONG SINCE A GOOD ONE,,
"This isn't just a return to form for 3D Sonic, Frontiers exceeds all expectations and has shown that Sonic can still be innovative and iterated upon. This is the Sonic game many of us born in the late 90s/early 00s, who grew up with the anime and comics, dreamed of as kids. Don't sleep on this.",,
"Like everyone else said, the game isn't perfect. It's SUPER close, though, and honestly, it very easily could have been. It's just so incredibly sad that a Sonic game can't ever not be rushed. A weird thing about the Sonic series is that it just never had a truly perfect game, unlike Mario, Kirby and LEGO, for instance. This game was literally going to be the first Sonic game like that, but just at the end, the rushing kinda ruined the chance at becoming that perfect game. Almost makes ya wish Sonic Team would bust outta SEGA to continue as their own publisher... But no matter how sad that fact of the franchise is, the game is still amazing! Absolutely play it! :D

My hot takes on this game:
- Never thought I'd say this about a Sonic game, but this OST does not appeal to me in any way. No joke, I only enjoy two tracks: Kronos Island - Second Movement and . While in Cyberspace, I often turned down the music volume; I even completely muted it for the Titan fights because it's just earrape to me, lol (). EASILY my least favourite in the entire mainline franchise.
- I don't mind the pop-in, like, at all. Seriously, why does anybody even care? It never gets in the way of gameplay. Merely the render distance itself was troublesome a tiny handful of times, because I couldn't see the platforms in the sky where I knew I needed to go.
- I also don't really care that most Cyberspace environments are based on older assets or that the level designs are from older stages. If anything, as a mostly 3D Sonic fan, I love going 'Hey, I recognize this layout!' and experiencing said familiar layout in this game's new playstyle. That's kind of my nostalgia factor in Sonic games, only being a part of this community since, like, 2019. And not nearly this many people complain whenever they do this stuff with Classic Sonic games, which I, in turn, do not have any nostalgia for.
- S-ranking 1-2 is hella easy: just stay at ground level around the beginning. That's it. I know it's unusual for Sonic games, but the upper route with the Dash Rings is actually slower. I got it on my second try and I'm amazed at how immensely its difficulty has been overblown online.

A few other very minor critiques/ideas for improvements I have:
- The physics in Cyberspace are crap. I think it's just the amazing open-zone controls but with the default settings and no upgrades. Simply too slow.
- Aerial turning speed is WAY too low. After they improved the jump momentum in Update 2, I just really hope this little fix is next for Update 3.
- A fraction of the Boost sound effect, about a second in, sounds like a Koco sound effect to me and I can't get it outta my head. It confuses the heck out of me every time I Boost xD
- When running towards the edge of a cliff and trying to jump at the last second, Sonic might take a sharp 90° downwards, speeding into a pit (or at least not where you want to go).
- Add squetch to regular and double jump :)
- Post-Homing Attack delay.
- Stomp and Boost aren't refreshed upon touching objects that propel Sonic, like the Spring (Pole) and Dash Ring.
- Menus are a little slow (about two seconds of delay between pop-up and opening up to input).
- Just use a fixed order (Kronos > Ares > Chaos > Rhea > Ouranos) and fixed position (why scroll?) for the map screen's Island list.
- Why is quick travel only possible via the dedicated view on the map screen? The icons are already there in the default view.
- Make Sound Memories a completion objective, with a golden icon upon getting all of them on an island and counting towards the completion percentages.
- Give insight in which Guardians have (n)ever been beaten on a save.
- Unintended Guardian triggers can be annoying, I guess.
- Sonic going into 'combat mode' irritatingly restricts access to, like, everything.
- Not encouraged to beat Guardians because you already get Gears in SO much simpler ways.'
- The 'treasure spots' can contain props like Springs and Boost Pads from Chaos Island and on, which just feels like a prank every time lol.
- The sunny/sandstorm (not sure which one) weather condition can make Ares Island incredibly difficult to see.
- This game NEEDS a minimap.
- Please don't stop the Jukebox music while on the map. I understand in the pause menu, but the map ain't that.
- Ares Island can be a pain to navigate.
- When walking off an edge and letting go of the control stick, Sonic keeps ALL momentum and can easily overshoot the underlying platform in some of the newly added Koco's platforming sections.
- Oh yeah, there's pinball too, of course! No, I didn't really like it lol.
- Please make it so that Game Clear data isn't open-ended. Right now, when you load a cleared save file, it does that annoying open world/RPG thing where it just places you back right before the final boss as if you never beat it. I don't feel accomplished that way. Please remove the 'Get the (last) Chaos Emerald' objective and find some other way to make the final boss replayable.
- Please add more save file management: copying, moving and deleting files. (Perhaps even infinite files? I don't get why games even still have a limited amount of save files lol)
- Maybe build the Extras menu into the Options? :)
- Please make more cutscenes skippable.
- Remove tutorials during New Game+.
- Remove Drop Dash turn delay and shrink turn radius.
- I don't get how they STILL think it's fine to also those enemy types that are obviously just supposed to be homing attack targets a way of attacking. While going through a plaltforming section that contains them, it's basically just gonna be random whether you get hit. These secctions consist of non-stop on-rails gameplay. There's no time or room for timing avoiding these attacks. If they hit you and ruin your run, it'll basically random. In this open zone, though, it's much more bearable than in, say, Unleashed or Generations :)

Note: some of these issues can be fixed using Hedgemodmanager.

"Amazing to think this game looked so bad when it was first shown.

In what feels like a true return to form of the 3D Sonic franchise, Sonic Frontiers stands as a fresh new take in the Sonic universe. Sure, it borrows HEAVILY from Breath of the Wild, but it does so in an entertaining way. I thoroughly enjoyed this, and hope this means 3D Sonic will get many new exciting titles.

The best parts were definitely the Cyber Space worlds, they had just the right amount of fast-paced, nostalgia-packed action, while staying short and sweet.

Not without it's frustrations and some clunkiness here and there, but very enjoyable as a whole.

Finished 100% Hard mode in 26hrs, so do with that information what you will.

8/10 in my book.",,
"I haven't beaten the game yet, but I've had a great time so far. Its janky and has a very apparent lack of polish in a lot of areas, but if you can look past that, it's a good game. Its extremely fun to run around the overworld and explore the different platforming segments scattered around. Ironically I thought the Cyberspace boost levels would be my least favorite part of the game, but I honestly really like them and there's a good chunk of really fun levels to play. The soundtrack is also incredible, as expected. Combat is satisfying and works surprisingly well without disrupting the flow of the game much, although the homing attack feels annoying to use against enemies due to the sudden impact freeze effect it does every time.

Pop-in is a huge issue, you'll be running along and suddenly an entire platforming segment will gradually start appearing out of thin air right before your eyes as you are running. I've also noticed some random chunks of invisible collision scattered around the environment for seemingly no reason. And aesthetically, the overworld's structure with all the platforming slapped in looks very odd and doesn't mesh well.

Sonic plays much better in this game than he has in previous ones, but he still has some odd physics and can be a pain to platform with in certain areas, especially if you're trying to turn around backwards during platforming because you missed something. Jumping off a ramp doesn't launch you upwards like you'd expect; it only works like that if you're going up a rail, which is... strange. Sonic also stops on a dime with no continuous momentum, which is helpful in some areas but annoying in others. If you run off a ledge, you'll drop straight down extremely fast instead of continuing in the forward direction as you fall. His controls aren't bad, but it takes a little getting used to if you want to figure out what you can and can't do and how to do it effectively.

The story has me VERY interested, but I can't say much since I still haven't beaten the game. All I can say its better than anything we got in Colors, Generations, and Forces. There is an actual interesting plot with interesting dialogue and cutscenes. The voice acting is still a bit cheesy in some areas, but its not bad, and the new slightly mellowed out voice directions are pretty good.

TLDR; Needs polish, but Sonic Team finally did it again after a decade, its a good 3D Sonic game.",,
GODLY GAME. SONIC IS FAST. EGGY IS MAD.,,
one of the best sonic games since Mania! and by far the best modern Sonic game in ages.,,
"Feels like a love letter to sonic fans, they went and validated all the lore, and even addressed major character development concerns.

Gameplay wise you have two game modes, an adventuring mode where you explore, unlock lore, play in the sandboxish overworld to collect items to expand lore and push the story forward. The second mode called 'cyberspace' is a speedrunner mode where you go through linear levels to go for fast times, collect 5 rings and beat the level without losing rings. (Cyberspace is probably my favorite part of the game.)

There are theatrical boss bottles, with very interesting music (Tastes vary but I love the metalcore inspired boss battle music.) The cyberspace levels use different flavors of EDM, dubstep, house, trance. The overworld is ambient and orchestral. (I love the fishing music especially.)

There are also enemies and minibosses all around the world, for the most part optional but they are an easy way to farm talent tree XP and cogs to open cyberspace levels.

This game honestly feels like Sonic Adventure 3. It tries very hard to converge everything that the sonic fans have been asking for from a 3D sonic game.

There are a few accessibility options to adjust sonic's speed, turning radius, acceleration and more. I don't think those options apply to cyberspace. There are multiple ways to earn items for progression so even if you don't like a certain game mode, you can skip it via fishing or other means.

The game isn't perfect. The graphics options are a bit limited. There is pop-in, especially at the highest speed levels. A lot of lore is locked behind collecting and fishing, so if you skip it you may end up a little lost. The UI is a bit sluggish, locking controls for several seconds before allowing an action. The Speed/Ring level up is very slow. Retry is in a submenu for some reason? Minor issues, overall the game is quality for a sonic game. Best since Sonic Generations. I would say it's on par or better than Generations.

I enjoyed this game so much that I'm going to 100% achievement because why not?",,
"The gameplay is great as well as the exploration, and combat with the giant robot enemies. The story is also really good and the fishing is enjoyable and pretty funny once you get enough catches.",,

"(SPOILER FREE!!!!!)I'll get to the point. I've played this game for over 4 hours and i gotta say SEGA YOU KNOCKED IT OUTTA THE PARK!!! I'm enjoying the gameplay very well, Sonic himself controls very well, despite feeling weird in the beginning. He does not feel exactly like in Generations, unleashed, colors, forces, etc. But it's easy to get used to. I have not completed the game but I am enjoying the story a lot. For big fans, the sonic characters feel much more similar to their unleashed/ adventure counter parts (REMEMBER: I DIDN'T COMPLETE THE GAME SO I CAN'T SAY FOR SURE). The quests in this game feel fun to complete. Cyberspace levels are definitely for people who enjoyed Sonic generations, but newer players can enjoy too, its fun to 100% complete those levels. The atmosphere for the game is very mysterious and beautiful. The only glitch I came across was falling through the floor and dying after defeating an enemy. Lastly my only complaint is that sometimes the game switches from having cutscenes with amazing squash and stretch animations to other cutscenes with little to no animation. Oh and I almost forgot, fishing with big is kinda fun, the lofi music is very calming while fishing.

TL;DR: Good gameplay, good characters, good controls, good music, good animation, good EVERYTHING. If you have been holding off on getting the game. GET IT. Its worth the 60-70 bucks! THIS IS AN AMAZING GAME! SO WORTH THE YEARS OF WAITING",,
"After the past couple sonic games, I came with low expectations, but after seeing many people vouch for the game, I coughed up the $60 and I was ready to be let down once again, but I was wrong. There are little finicky parts like the camera and the new physics, that in my opinion feel slow and obviously different compared to the momentum based physics in the previous games, but these are very little things to me and don't stop me from enjoying the game, I've played a bunch of open world sonic fan games when I was little and having an official one like this is awesome and made me want to buy it in the first place. On top of that I love the RPG aspects and the combat system, that combined with the new cutscenes and voice acting, this game feels entirely different from past ones and I love it. Honestly, Sonic Team are definitely going in the right direction after making this and I hope they keep it up. Once you get used to the controls the game feels very satisfying to play and running around an open world being able to do whatever, whenever, has always been one of my favorite aspects in a game, and having a sonic game with this factor has personally been long awaited and I'm glad they didn't screw this concept up.
P.S. Also, it kind of sucks that they capped the game at 60 frames, but after playing on it for a while I haven't seen any sort of bugs or frame drops at all and as someone who plays other games on high refresh rates 60 frames feels perfectly fine to me and I have no complaints.
At this point in my playthrough I would give a solid 9/10.",,
game is so goated,,
"Sonic Frontiers is an amazing return to 3D Sonic. It's different from what we're used to, but an amazing first attempt. Game play is solid for the most part. Cyberspace can be hit or miss, though I can say the music pads things out a bit. I can say the Open-Zones are fun to blast around in. And again, the soundtrack is the typical Sonic goodness we've made memes over.

***SPOILER*** There are only four official islands to explore, one of which is for a small story bit. The other is essentially the other half of an existing island. I'm saying that to foster the right expectations.

The story has deeper notes than I expected, and the game portrays its characters appropriately. For as many ups-and-downs we've experienced over the years, this represents leaps and bounds in the right direction for our blue boi.",,
"So far as this review has been posted, I have not came across any glitch or crash what so ever and movement, combat and gameplay it self is very solid.Sonic fans finally eating good",,
9/10,,
"Product received for free

sonic",,
"After the disappointment that was Sonic Forces, I'm glad to say this game is great in many aspects. It's not perfect, but this is a great starting point for future games to improve upon.

Pros
Fantastic Story (Ian Flynn)
Awesome Music
Large Open Zones to explore (4 Islands)
Lots of thing to do in them, such as puzzles to fill a map, and collectibles to advance the story


Mixed:
Cyber Space Stages (mainly due to the controls being really weird, and the reuse of stage layout in most stages. Some are original, and are the best imo)
The forth Island just being the second half of the first island (It's mixed since the platforming challenges are quite fun and challenging

Cons
It feels jittery to move on the ground






The game is such a breath of fresh air, and (for the most part) it succeeds. I hope for the next game, they take what they have, refine it based on what people are saying (ie: Pinball physics and original levels), then I think will be in for a good time (Please don't age badly)",,
"SPOILERS FOR SONIC FRONTIERS, IF YOU HAVENT PLAYED OR DONT WANT TO BE SPOILED DON'T READ

Sonic Frontiers honestly felt like a fresh change of pace to the blue blur when it came to his few most recent outings. The open-zone gameplay was a bit tedious at times when I couldn't find where I needed to go because Pop In was hiding the rails, etc etc, and not learning about the ""Infinity Sign with Cyloop = Infinite Boost"" until the Last Island.

Cyberspace Zones felt off. Like, I recognized certain stage references they made when it came to stage layout and such but gosh, did you HAVE to limit it to Green Hill, Chemical Plant, Sky Sanctuary and Speed Highway? I felt like if there was some variety when it came to the zones that it could've felt a lot less...Samey, plus sonic's physics didn't work very well alot of the time, or just didn't feel ""fast enough"" like it was wearing heavy shoes.

The writing by Ian Flynn was honestly top notch! I love his writing for the IDW Sonic Comics and it was even better seeing it in an official game! The game had lots of charm when it came to its cutscenes and wasn't afraid to reference older games/sonic's friends a lot of the time.

SPOILERS FOR END GAME

The boss being ""The End"" as like some sort of thing that was following the ancients like some sort of dark all consuming entity, and having its true form be the Moon was a bit weird, It could've been explained a bit better before the fight happened with the 5 tower cutscenes or Sonic Stuck in Cyberspace Corruption and coming across this ""Void"", Also the fact you don't get the True Boss Battle unless you play on HARD MODE, which is an easy fix because you can switch your difficult before taking on the final boss, but still.

The fact that I noticed the Final Boss seemed VERY LACK LUSTER and SUPER easy to beat before getting a QTE to finish off this ""Threat"". It felt like Sonic Team might've been rushed for their ending and had to slap things together instead of making it this huge super sonic mech boss fight, Kinda like Sonic Unleashed's Final Boss. Heck, all the other islands Super Sonic boss fight's had A LOT more punch and impact, especially Chaos Island, like! The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sword and everything!! The OST made those moments go so hard!

But when you can't even have the vocals of your final song not play until the latter half of the fight, it just seems like you're underplaying it compared to previous boss fights.

If you're a New Sonic fan or just a sonic fan in general I'd say pick it up! On average if you play the game a bit, you'd have around 16 hrs. I mostly kinda cheaped out after the 10 hour mark and for the last two worlds Using Big's fishing minigame to help quickly get more Keys, Gears and Attack/Defense items.",,
"Overall, fans of the series will have a blast.

My review will be scattered since I want to get back to the game, but here we... go:

Mechanically, anyone with fancy fingers will be SUPER impressed with the range of movement Sonic has. You can pretty much move in any direction at any moment, even the boost provides verticality and can be used as a triple jump!

Draw distance issues are prominent, and probably the biggest issue in the game. Please patch this immediately. I would rather go to a location to ""activate"" the open zone stage to spawn in the course before playing, rather than wander around a beautiful world with so many rails and platforms floating around in the air. Tying these two problems together, you could kill two birds with one stone?

The ability to cancel Homing Attack into Boost can lead to clever traversal, and it helps that the analog stick direction lets you choose a Homing Attack target easily. Holding Stomp Attack to bounce then converting into a Drop Dash is awesome, yet it always seems better to Boost for speed instead. I wish these movement options were more useful getting around! Homing Attack against enemies is powerful, and while I understand the design may have been to avoid enemies for Time Trials, NEVER using Homing Attack on enemies because of the duration it takes to finish the attack doesn't feel good! Maybe Homing Attack on enemies could have been used to charge up boost temporarily to store all that speed, so you'd have a reason to want to kill enemies rather than running past them? Sonic Unleashed had daytime stages that already nailed that feeling of flow for enemies. I'd really like to see drop dash, stomp, bounce, dodge, and slide be able to aid more in movement than they do now, the same goes for these moves against enemies!

The more emotional side of the cutscenes, especially with Amy, was a great break from the action, and added heart in ways I've wanted for a while from the series. I hope future titles can live and learn from this.

Controls great going fast! Terrain can cause Sonic's model to jitter violently regardless of speed, this should at least be addressed in the NEXT open world game. (Don't stop me now!)

Sonic needs to be faster in some cyber zones, too! I understood they were supposed to be more platformer-based, or slower to give the player a breather, but that shouldn't come at the cost of altering Sonic's speed so often in different parts of the game.

VFX for special skills need to be improved. Emitting slash particles out of your hand for it to play the same attacking sound a dozen times felt silly. ""Sonic Boom"" and ""Cross Slash"" specifically were very goofy looking, but I still enjoyed the spacing they provided, as well as having a projectile to use for certain enemies that were better at close range.

Fishing was enjoyable, and a great break from all the high speeds. I'd ask for more chill activities in the next game, because I don't want to stop playing, just catch my breath from the hours of speed.

The characters talking about enemies from past games like Dark Gaia and even the Black Arms was a great touch that made the game feel alive and running!

It goes without saying the music is ALWAYS fantastic in Sonic. Some tracks more hype then others, but when Kellin Quinn (my favorite vocalist) from Sleeping With Sirens came on during the Super Sonic boss fight I just lost it!

THANK YOU FOREVER for putting in the Sonic Adventure 2 Shoes! I honestly couldn't have asked for cooler DLC.

I've been a fan for almost three decades, so I owe it to offer a review. (Plus, it's grating repeating myself to different folks.) But as before, I surmise players will generally enjoy Sonic Frontiers and see the potential for this formula. It isn't without flaws, luckily the issues present can easily be patched in future updates. So... Come on, step it up!",,
Awesome!,,
"This game is a blast!!!

This is one of the most fun in games i had in a while, the pacing of this game feels so good that i didn't notice i was playing for hours, if you are a sonic fan or someone that likes platformer action, this game will make you feel like a kid playing a new game on Christmas morning",,
"This game man, words can not describe how much I loved playing this game.
Aside from a few physics & collision glitches (Mostly in certain Cyberspace stages) this game is down right near flawless.
The gameplay is simple yet addictive, the open-zones are a blast to explore, the music is flawless as ever, and the story, oh my god the story!
I don't think I've ever been this invested in these characters since Black Knight on the Wii, that's how good the story is!
If this is what the next few Sonic games are gonna be like, than I'm all in for it!",,
"After completing the game, I can safely say give this game a chance! This new style for Sonic brings crazy new combat mechanics, open-world with almost no limitations, and fantastic music.

Whether you are new to Sonic or a old fan, definitely pick this game up as it's absolutely a blast.",,
"2nd best 3D sonic game to sonic adventure 2, honestly very close to being the best 3D sonic game and imo best game in the series. Cyberspace holds the game back as the controls are quite garbage, but if those were cleaned up (and visual level design had a bit more variety) and if the game had a little bit more to the ending (not going into any spoilers to talk about what I mean) the game would easily be the best 3D sonic game. The story also gives huge payoff to fans of the series, including side games stories like Sonic Riders and TSR. ""Everything is canon"" is quite true and I'm very glad to see it. I'm very excited to see where this direction will take the series in the future. Overall a solid 8/10 game (comparing to sa2's 9/10) with it EASILY getting an unofficial 9-10/10 depending on how supported the game is by mods in the future, I would HIGHLY recommend this game for anyone wanting to get into the sonic series and I would say this is a must play for any sonic fans going forward!",,

"After dedicating the last two days of my life to this game with breaks only for the bathroom and a small amount of sleep, I can officially say that this is the best 3d Sonic game ever made. It's not perfect, but it's a fantastic direction for the series to go and I am so glad this didn't end up being terrible. It has a few nitpicks, but nothing that pissed me off to an extent where I put the game down. This is absolutely worth your money, I got all the achievements in around 23 hours!",,
"This is easily the best Sonic game released in over a decade, hell it might even be a contender for best 3D Sonic game ever made. The story and characterization are easily some of the best they've ever done, the soundtrack is an amazing mix of the Adventure era rock songs with the Modern era's EDM with this game going way farther in both directions (heavy metal and straight rave music), and the gameplay is super fluid with you easily being able to go from speeding through the world, straight into combat, and doing puzzles.

Unlike past ""good"" games, there's no massive flaw that detracts from an otherwise amazing experience (Adventure titles being early 3D so they don't hold up well today, Generations having a lackluster story, Unleashed's Warehog levels, etc.). It's just a solid experience all around, definitely not ""best game ever""/""game of the year"" quality but easily up there for a Sonic title so all the 7/10's this game is getting makes sense.

The only complaints I got are fairly minor:
1. The graphics settings for a PC port are kinda lacking. No Ultrawide monitor support and locked 60 FPS sucks (but that is to be expected from past Sonic titles and has already been modded in)
2. Cyberspace reusing the same 3 general level themes and older game layouts (it's ""okay"" since the rest of the game is so good and it's not the main focus of the game but definitely something they should improve on next game)
3. They really need to patch the Elder to allow redeeming multiple at once, having to click through 1 by 1 all the way up to 99 is absurd.",,
Just wanted to say that this is one of the best Sonic games in recent times. There are some minor issues but nothing technical apart from the game being capped at 60fps and definitely nothing game-breaking..,,

"Before you buy I'd like to offer a quick warning: Do not go into this game expecting 5 fully fleshed out islands.

However; I must say that this is easily the best sonic has ever felt to control in a 3-D environment and that is worth the price of admission alone.",,

now onto the Review of this game

This Game.....oh boy this game blew my expectations wide open,, and the door off the hinges..
after playing it for a good amount of hours 14 hours as of this writing ~

This Game Feels Good it plays good the combos are statsifying,,,and heck who knew a Sonic Semi Open World Game Would be soo much god dang fun, its Satisfying the speed is thrilling and they made it an easy to collect rings

the bosses and the quests are satsifying and i love the trials (classic stages) wasnt what i was thinking it would be but thats ok...its what i wanted Variety.

Also i find it Amusing the fan base complained about green hill being redone over and over and i find it amusing that green hill was redone over and over in this game in multiple different varieties,,, its like Sega knew we complained about it and gave us green hill just for complaining (joking by the way but it is still funny to think of it that way) i would recomomend this game 10/10 its a great game and for once sega is heading in the right direction! you got sonic on the big screen right and now you got Sonic in 3D Right Good Job Sega and Good Job IDW for the Awesome Story and continued sucess of the comics",,
"This game is really good! Although it has some flaws (for example most of the cyberspace levels), it is a very enjoyable experience with highs that match the best the series has offered. Give this game a shot if you're on the fence with this game.",,
DJEEEEENT 😤🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘,,
Good! Great! Awesome! Outstanding! AMAZING!,,
"If Sonic had a baby with Breath of the Wild, this would be it.",,
Best Sonic game ever,,
Yes,,
If you collect all 8 chaos emeralds you can play as Big the cat.,,
"♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing. Easily the best game since SA2. The movement is so freaking good after getting used to it. We're back to just moving around, being one of the biggest source of fun. The stage design may be the best we've seen yet. The music is really good. The story is really interesting, giving us more lore and some well deserved development for the side characters.
I'm willing to say that this is, with consideration to my first comment, the best Sonic game in 20 years",,
"Possibly one of the best Sonic games in recent years. Overall the transition to open world was handled wonderfully. Despite my initial concerns with modern open world games, I think Frontiers hit the nail on the head, and this is hopefully the start of a new, refreshing formula for Sonic.

Let's start with the pros:
- The activities in the world are diverse, and spaced enough to where it never quite feels boring traversing through the world, doing challenges, collecting items, doing quests, etc.
- The characterization is some of the best it's ever been in a Sonic game. Sonic, Knuckles, Amy and Tails are all written like actual characters in this game, compared to their more shallow portrayals in recent games. Knuckles side story being the most notable out of the group. Sage is also a very nice inclusion to the franchise, and her character and story are pretty enjoyable to watch as well.
- The darker tone and story work surprisingly well, I found it very easy to get attached to the plot pretty early on. While it does kind of fall off in the end, the journey up until that point is a blast.
- The music is overall pretty hit or miss. It doesn't have the consistency of Unleashed, Lost World, or Sonic Adventure 2's soundtracks, but there are a good amount of great themes in this game.
- Combat is pretty solid overall, it's not mechanically deep or anything, and it's not trying to be. It's fun, flashy and fast, which is fitting for Sonic. Makes you wonder why he wasn't using his speed for fighting before this game.
- The platforming is extremely clean and precise, a perfect blend of speed and platforming, for my taste, especially in some of the later areas. Finding that balance between speed and platforming has been an area Sonic has struggled with in some of his more modern games, but I think this is a perfect balance.
- The highlight of the game is almost certainly the boss fights, bringing a nice blend of platforming and combat, (almost) every boss is a blast to fight. Like the challenges around the world, they are diverse enough and scattered enough to never feel super repetitive (outside of some reused mini-bosses towards the end). The mainline bosses though are so incredibly over the top and creative, they're a blast to fight every time.

Some cons:
- Cyberspace levels are a mixed bag. Some of the level designs are genuinely great, with some nice callbacks to previous games in said Cyberspace levels. But unfortunately they only share 4 different level aesthetics, which are constantly reused throughout the game. I can only get excited about the Green Hill Zone aesthetic but so much.
- While overall the story is engaging for most of the game, the ending does feel a little anticlimactic unfortunately. I won't get into spoilers, but it just feels like it was kind of rushed in the last 30 minutes.


Overall I think this is a fantastic game, and I am extremely hopeful for the future of Sonic if we continue to get games like this moving forward. Number ratings are silly and arbitrary, but if I had to give a rating, I would give it a solid 8.5-9 out of 10. I would recommend buying it at full price as well, because it is worth every penny. Hats off to SEGA and Sonic Team.",,
"Story is one of the better ones for sonic in the last 20 years, gameplay aswell. Much longer than the rest also, as something like gens can be beaten in 5~ hours but im not even halfway done at 7 (I dont mean 100% i mean straight up just beating the main story). The open world seems random at first but following the paths the mini sonic level chunks placed about is pretty fun and also makes traversing the maps interesting. All of the chunks are placed thoughtfully so far and time can just fly by if you arent careful lol.

Only issues are the lowest denominator enemies have no incentive to actually fight them, so you often will just fly right by them after the 2nd island + the popin that everyone seems to mention is actually pretty bad. It wont ruin the game as often enough is loaded in for you to start the chunk and the rest loads in as you progress, its just weird and kinda awful to look at. One last nitpick is that currently the parry + sonic boom feel way to strong. Obv if they bother you just dont use them too often, but in some scenarios you are forced to parry and the lack of timing makes it feel like stop and go platforming -> just a pause in the action. Make enemies actually punish you if you hold sonic boom to long + make you time parry and then those 2 nitpicks are gone.

Game looks and sounds great, story is engaging and has bunch of lil callbacks n ♥♥♥♥ kinda goes hard. Only issues dont really effect anything and combat nitpicks can mostly be avoided. Overall 9/10 again issues dont effect the core game but its still enough to take a point off. Cant wait to see what the mod community can make out of this ngl + maybe dlc?",,
"Sonic is back at full speed! The open zone gameplay really is a great direction for the Sonic franchise. The Super Sonic battles are the greatest boss battles in the franchise easily. Of course, the music in this game is phenomenal, as expected. There is some weird pop-in sometimes, but it's not a deal-breaker in the slightest.

All in all, this game is great and I can't wait to see what the next game will be like!",,
"Sonic Frontiers is a divisive game that I personally had a lot of fun playing. There's flaws that need to be addressed, such as how janky it is, and the atrocious pop in, but even with that, it didn't wholly ruin my experience. Sonic feels good to control in the open zone, there's a good amount of enemies and challenges sprinkled in, and it has some of the best music and setpieces in the series. Me personally, I'm mixed on cyberspace. As in, at first and in some levels, it doesn't feel good to play, but in others, it feels really good, and I even found myself replaying a couple of them to speedrun. It's kinda one of those things where you have to play in order to understand. Overall, I had fun with the time I played it, and I'm still having fun. I'd say play the game for yourself for a couple hours and see if its the right kind of game for you. It's a pretty unpolished sandbox, but once you get past the scratches, and maybe the hole in the wall, you'll have a fun time.",,
"Its been awhile since we've gotten this good of a sonic game. The 3D movement feels good, the story's actually alright with decent character development with added lore and plenty of references for all Sonic fans. The combat is a bit jank and it's barely even used. You unlock all your abilities by the 2nd island which is very disappointing. The pop in gets pretty annoying which does interfere with exploring a bit. The 2D sections control pretty bad and there's alot of them so be ready for that. Cyberspace levels are very much hit or miss. You'll love them or hate em. The music is really good which comes as no surprise. The boss fights are really good and are varied in both combat and design. My main issue with this game is that it is very repetitive. You will experience just about everything the game has to offer by the second island. With that being said, this game gets my recommendation. I hope SEGA continues and improves on this formula going forward.",,
"This game is mid, Sonic fans are so deprived of good games that they call stuff like this ""goated"". It is not, the open world is bland, fighting system gets boring after 5 mins and the gameplay itself is borderline irritating sometimes, sonic doesn't have animations for side cutscene's (when you visit big for the first time his mouth doesn't even move when he speaks) it just doesn't feel like a sonic game, which I get it it's not supposed to be I guess. But nonetheless I would wait for a sale since like I said it's ""mid"" not ""bad"". There's a lot of stuff that is fun like exploring the world, hearing Roger Craig Smith actually get some good dialogue for sonic and most importantly seeing sonic be the snarky ♥♥♥♥ he is.

Overall this game is ok, its nothing oustanding, just a neat little game. Definitely not worth 60 bucks though.",,

"If you, in any capacity, are a fan of the Sonic series, then you absolutely want the game. This game will destroy you emotionally with lore that dates all the way back to the classic games. There are references literally every where, and that is thanks to Ian Flynn for juicing up the Sonic story with ""comic book"" level details. They do not miss with the references at all.

Aside from that, the gameplay is phenomenal. Sonic controls easily and the amount of cool tricks, abilities, and combat skills you can do is crazy. My only gripe is some level design choices. Yes the pop in is bad, but honestly idgaf if the gameplay is smooth and sexy to bout.

BUT the icing on the cake is the boss fights and the music. I mean obviously Sonic music slaps, but I dare to say that this might be the best Sonic soundtrack in the franchise. The bosses? Don't get me started. The minibosses you fight in the overworld are unique and have cool ways of overcoming them, but the end island bosses. Holy. Words cannot describe how insane these are. You literally whip out some of the craziest final boss caliber fights over and over with some banger music to boot.

I am high off of this game. This game is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good. Definitely top 3 Sonic games for me. AND there's basically Touhou in this game so like W.

Get this game. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.",,

The combat is great, the speed is great, the exploration is really cool, and overall it's a very solid game. A little too much clipping and no 60 fps+ option, but still recommend.",,
"I haven't even finished the game, but regardless of that, the game itself is so good! The characters and the story (as I mentioned before, haven't finished the game) were written the way it needs to be written. Despite its flaws, it is a fun game to play. If you're a Sonic Fan, I highly recommend this game~",,
"After finishing the game which took me 14 hours to beat, I can say this is the best Sonic game in a long time. Probably my favorite 3D Sonic game besides adventure 2. There are some negatives and things that fell short but overall a step in the right direction. The boss fights and the music is the peak parts of the game. Overall I would recommend to pick it up when it goes on sale. Good job Sega team I am looking forward to the next installment in the Sonic franchise.",,
"Sonic Frontiers not only is a good, fun game, but also a solid foundation for future releases. The game nails one of the most crucial things, it's fun to just run around in the open world. While the physics aren't perfect (Air boost kills momentum, running of ledge sometimes doesn't carry momentum / sonic just drops like a rock) but when the stars align and you do manage to send yourself flying across the island, doing tricks, it's something truly amazing.

The combat is serviceable, works best against enemies that you have to actually read the attacks off, some Guardians are more spectacle and are arguably the weakest enemies due to that.

The main Titan bosses are the best enemies in the game, you have to read their attacks and pull off sick combos to defeat them, if you haven't seen any footage of these fights, keep it that way and experience it yourself.

The story builds off the characters and lore throughout the series, without spoiling much, this game truly feels like a spiritual Sonic Adventure 3, most of this game builds off the lore established there.

This is an easy 7/10 that can become an 8 with some inevitable mods that fix the physics, but there are some issues that mods alone won't fix. Cyberstages are easily the weakest part of the game, a massive pace breaker. These stages should have been incorporated into the islands themselves, what's weird is that the game already kinda does this, there are underground temples that act like little levels and floating structures that function as levels (Not just floating platforms, actual floating temple structures).",,

Sonic Frontiers isn't perfect, but it lays a really good foundation for future Sonic games. I believe this game is worth a try if you're a long time Sonic fan.",,
It's like Sonic has gotten a lot more Stronger Since the Beginning! Keep Going Sonic!!!,,
not quite sonic riders,,
best ♥♥♥♥ ever,,
"Ngl best sonic game since sonic mania. Graphics, gameplay, refrences a lot of things are just great about this game.
Lets not forget about the music 🥵",,
Easily the best 3D Sonic game since Sonic Adventure 1 and 2. They have gone back to having a good serious story accompanied by great freely controllable gameplay with a good control scheme. The visuals and cutscenes are also done really well.,,
"the game is good, i mean like its a solid 8.5 i wouldn't say a 9 because of all the problem other people seem to have with the game running bad, i didn't have that problem. i think it's a great step in the right direction.

some thing to note though, everything has collision, tiny rocks that slightly poke off the ground hit them and you go flying if you are boosting.

its not exactly a open world in the sense that you would thing, being a open hub that holds the levels and such, with parts that are locked due to story reasons, but something that sonic hasn't done yet but all platforming games did to go into 3D being a collectathon, which is up to you how you feel on it, it wasn't bad and there were enough shortcuts around the major stuff with fishing if you really dont wanna do the open world stuff for the things you need to progress.

story is kinda ehh, i mean if you are a sonic fan you will like the things it shows and brings to light (maybe im kinda ehh on it but i like the call backs) and i will say if you haven't you should at least read up on stuff for Sonic adventure cause they bring back to that alot its sorta plot relevant but not really, more mentioned in passing. * we will see on this point, gimme a few days to see if i changed my mind on the story cause it was pretty good, but i wanna see if that changes*

combat is fine, i mean its not bad and health bars aren't new to sonic, but more options to do damage come up throughout the game so it doesn't really get stale.

i would say its worth it for the experience, but if you are on the fence then wait for a sale

oh and soundtrack as a sonic game it has a good soundtrack that you can at least count on as it is a sonic game",,
"I was initially skeptical before the game came out, but having played this game for myself (12 hours at the time of this review), I must say it's a blast to play! It feels fun just running around as everyone's favorite blue rodent and just exploring the Starfall Islands. One complaint that I have is that the Cyber Space (traditional Sonic Acts) has its own physics that doesn't feel that great. But since exploring the Open Zones is the main part of the game, I don't really consider it that big of an issue. I'd consider this a must-buy if you are a Sonic fan!",,
Definitely exceeded my expectations,,
"I'd say wait for a sale to get the game, it's pretty good, but right now not for $60",,
Sonic Breath of the Wild. W game,,
"Sonic Generations is the last 3D Sonic game I enjoyed prior to this. Sonic Adventure 2 is probably the last time I truly loved a 3D Sonic game before this. But this? We've finally been given something good again. The first island and major boss gave me basically the experience of the entirety of an ordinary Sonic game. The boss made me feel a way I haven't felt about a Sonic game in a long time. Just pure joy, the likes of which I haven't felt since I was a kid playing SA2.

Is there jank? Yes. Is it a bit repetitive? Yes. But man it is just fun to run around as Sonic in a big open world and actually have a story with characters and Sonic isn't just a meme spouting ♥♥♥♥ and the music is awesome and man. Just man. Yes I recommend this game, despite any flaws. If you've been waiting to have fun with a Sonic game again, this is it.",,
"Easily the best 3D Sonic game in the last 10 years, story is good, ost slaps like always, gameplay and especially the boss battles are the best ever made by far in this franchise. What I didn't like at first was the slow clunky movement in the traditional boost stages, but it's got its own charm since there's so much to do if you want to S rank the stage, ESPECIALLY the second boost stage at the beginning, it all tests your timing on your boosts and jumps, which is surprisingly really engaging. Combat is really good, really easy if you know how to parry, moveset looks cool and flashy. There's more but I will not spoil it, hopefully you get to enjoy this game fully new to get the full experience. it's got an easy 8/10 from me, it's definitely an amazing game, but on all other things like the moveset and graphical issues like pop-ins or a flaring screen or even loading issues where the landmass hasn't even loaded yet, if those things were fixed along with some janky camera movements and (some) noticeably glitchy bosses then this would be a 10/10. Just a little more polishing, but apart from that, if you like Sonic games you won't be disappointed!",,
"Best sonic game in a long time.

Combat is by far the best aspect of the game. Yeah! really! Homing attacks, combos with punches and kicks, special attacks, parries, dodges. But it all feels very ""Sonic"". You can dash and leave a trail of energy, if you make a loop it causes damage and disables shields of enemies inside the loop. If you got 400 rings you go at hyper speed, and if you do 100 hits combo sonic basically becomes instant-transmission Goku! You effectively have so many ways to deal with the enemies, which are all well designed.

The open world reminds me of Breath of the Wild, and I was surprised that for a sonic game it doesn't hold your hand. There are puzzles everywhere expecting a trigger or action and rarely does it give you hints. Honestly, for kids or non-gamers these puzzles might be a little hard and I love it. Completing the puzzles not only gives you resources but it also creates rails or bumpers for faster traveling later.

The gameplay loop is simple defeat bosses to get gears, get the gears to open up portals (This game's version of the Temples or more traditional sonic stages), get a good rank to get vault keys and collect all the chaos emeralds.

Problems?
Speed controls are a bit stiff, especially air control.
Stages are only a minute long.
FPS locked to 60
I prefer the stylised art design than the realistic style they went for.",,
best sonic game since colors,,
buy it its actually good no joke,,
"Controls feel great, traversal is fun and combat is a blast. Would definitely recommend even if you're not a fan of the series. Beautiful music!",,
This is a love letter from Sonic Team to the fans of the franchise. It has personality and ambition like no other sonic game since unleashed. I got that feeling of pure happiness just like when I played sonic adventure and then was hit with some of the best music in the franchise EVER!!,,
good game,,
bro that super sonic fight 🔥🔥🔥,,
I'm loving this new Sonic game. Chao Garden??,,
feels wonderful worth the wait,,
snonic.,,
Almost lost NNN over how good this game is. So basically a 9/10,,
♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Get it.,,
"I haven't played much but what i can say so far is that its a really, really fun game!

The story is phenomenal and the best story that a mainline sonic game has had since Sonic Adventure 2 (2001).

The quests are pretty interesting and fun, the cyberspace levels are pretty fun, the graphics look amazing, and the open world is amazing to just run around and explore.

I highly recommend this game for sonic fans and non sonic fans if you love open world games and platformers.

Also you can get SOAP shoes if you sign up for the newsletter so that's really neat!",,
"The game updated, so now I need to update my review since some of the criticisms were addressed.

If you like the direction that 3D Sonic games have gone in starting with Sonic Unleashed, you'll like this game.

If you hate the direction 3D Sonic games have gone in since Sonic Unleashed, you will find that this game didn't address anything.

The most recent update does crawl back things that made it even worse; and since it's no longer part of the game, I won't bring them up. They fixed those. Good job!

But sadly, making this game open-world did not improve the shallow game play and super simple uninspired rail-based level design that plagues all modern 3D Sonic games.

This game hurts because I want to see a 3D Sonic game that uses the momentum-based gameplay of the 2D games so bad. Sadly, I'm still left waiting for it to be made one day.

This is yet another Modern 3D Sonic game. If you've never played one before, give it a try, maybe you'll like it. If you already know you don't like them, skip this one. It doesn't do anything different.",,

10/10 Sonic did a gay little dance,,

"Not the Sonic Adventure 3 we wanted, but it's very much acceptable.",,
"I played this game on early release and let me tell you this.

It is by far, one of the best games I've ever played, it may not look like I've played many games, but I've played and tested out hundreds of games and this has got to be one of my favourites.

The landscape is similar to Pokemon Legends Arceus and Apex Legends
The gameplay and music is like Breath of the Wild
There's loads of content and you get to level up damage, speed, etc.
You also get to do the zoomies, Sonic go *BRRRRRRRRRRR*",,
"I feel like this game definitely is a GIANT leap away from forces and to an enjoyable game. I feel like the MAIN world (Open Zone) is good in the sense that there is much to explore and do while just going from place A to place B. It does have its issues such as weird physics at times and when you accidentally hit a boost pad and go on a 20 second auto-placement to 2D sections. Cyberspace levels are still meh with some being quite easy and others being a bit more challenging to complete. MAX time in a level would be 2:30ish but usually are around a minute. The fights are TOP NOTCH (except 1) and think anyone would enjoy playing the game.

If I was to rate it, I'd give it a 7-8/10. This is a great first attempt in a new direction that feels that it can become more!",,
"This is Sega's best game since Mania and honestly idk how they will top this in the future. (in terms of 3d sonic games)
If you dont want to pay $80(cad)/$60(usd) for this thats fine with the bugs at most its worth 10 bucks less but at the moment the game is great though the upgrading seems a bit excessive.
6 chaos emeralds in and not even got probably a 5th of the game i love it and now i offically cant refund it so its going to be played a lot.

From this line on may contain spoilers about story you may not want to know

One thing that greatly pissed me off was the game slowed to a simple 20 FPS which to communicate is lower then the cut-scene frame rate at 30 fps which runs better then 20 anyway because i played on 30 for about 5 minutes when the glitch happened.

thank you for reading

"This is 100% the best Sonic game since Generations, arguably better.

Controls are a blend of the best actions in 3D games (light speed dash, revamped bounce bracelet, drop dash, etc) and work incredibly well. The new combat system is super fun and satisfying, combos aren't difficult and pulling them off feels fantastic. Aside from a few minor nitpicks like losing momentum in jumps, everything is well thought out and satisfying.

The open world environment is fantastic, it's all 3D and the transition from running around to platforming is seamless. Boosting no longer requires rings (the meter refills itself), and you can really open up and go fast. Including the Cyberspace levels, the game is 90% 3D and never intermixes the 2D and 3D sections. Controls feel a bit clunkier in the Cyberspace levels, but the level design certainly makes up for it. Gone is the ""on-rails"", ""hold boost to win"" feeling of games like Unleashed and Generations, it's a faster variation of Sonic Adventure 2 level design that feels like a perfect sweet spot between speed and platforming.

As for the writing...it's the perfect mature sweet spot for Sonic. Not over-the-top dark and edgy like the Shadow game, but not a clown-fest of kids' show humor like Sonic Colors. PLUS THE CHARACTERS SHOW EMOTION!!! As far as performance goes, it's polished! Minimal bugs and runs stable! A bit of pop in, and some may dislike the 60fps cap, but nothing major. And it doesn't even need to be said that the soundtrack is top tier.

TL;DR: best Sonic game in a long time.",,

The game IS really awesome and really GOOD, yes, but I'm here mostly to clear up the Cyberspace panic.
No, it isn't as hellish as you think, you just gotta learn how to battle the air controls. Should we have to? No. But the rest of the game DOES make up for it with quality I'm sure you've all heard of already on the overall game. BUY, BUY, BUY!",,
"After beating the game (which, as far as I've seen, usually takes 20-25 hours), I still highly recommend it for anyone on the fence.

Frontiers seems to have taken great inspiration in the Adventure Fields idea and expanded them into open-world sections with a stage-like gameplay (meaning rails, boosts, enemies, mini-bosses, puzzles) inspired in the Unleashed formula but not limited by it.

There are actual stages inside the game (28, as far as I've counted), usually the size of Colors stages and made for high replayability instead of stage length. You need to go through them to proceed within the game, but they're not really the point, just a part of the bigger whole.

OST is as great as always, thematically fitting into the cyberspace/tech premise for the stages and mini-bosses, a Nier-like mysterious/ominous style for the open world and absurdly rocky bangers for the boss fights.

The character writing is a strong suit, and for this title they all sound like they've matured after their previous adventures. All characters sound more mature, speak of their past achievements and plans for the future and stay consistent to their personalities. The story is also decent enough without trying too hard to be complex or being just a silly excuse for another game.



TL;DR
Frontiers establishes a new standard for open-world Sonic games that deserves to be expanded upon and fleshed out, much like how Adventure 1 established a standard for Sonic's 3D transition and Unleashed established itself as a ""modern"" gameplay formula after many attempts and failures at striking gold.",,

Let's start with the main questions you're probably asking yourself:

""Is this game worth the money? Sonic's had some rough releases recently, so who's to say this one would be any different? Should I even bother? Is this game gonna be any good?""

My direct answer, TLDR, SHUT UP, AND PLAY IT FOR YOURSELF.
Sorry, that's... that was a bit violent.

The longer answer is this:
Sonic Forces was a really mediocre game, alright? That's not something up for debate at this point, it's a pretty well known point that Forces was just not a great Sonic game.

But this game is NOT Forces... This game is BETTER. Frontiers has so much good going for it with it's open world design, it's mysterious storytelling, YOU CAN PLAY THE GAME DURING THE LOADING SCREENS! I'm not gonna spoil too much about it, but I have only uncovered about 50% or so of the first island, and I've played 6 hours so far! That says a lot already for the play-time of this game!

Trust me, if you liked the Adventure titles, Sonic Unleashed's day stages, the good parts of Sonic Forces (experience may vary on this...), you will love this game! I'm just a random person on the internet, so take this review how you will... It's not an in-depth review, because I think the game speaks for itself- get it, play it, and see if I'm wrong! :3",,

"I highly Recommend this game, it is simply amazing. The visuals are stunning especially for a sonic game. The open world concept is just perfect for sonic. if your a long time fan of sonic there is one thing at the very start of the game you will notice that will bother the hell out of you but its whatever as it does not take away from the game at all (i wont spoil what it is lol).

I don't Recommend buying the digital deluxe content unless you would like to be able to access most the chaos emeralds early, and be able to free amy to early in the story that she is ""technically trapped"" in the dialogue when you can have here freed due to digital deluxe content. The sound track is very very good and that is especially important in a sonic game,

Edit: I now have 9 hours on the game and its fair to say i was completely wrong about the digital deluxe as do to many events i do not want to spoil and all it does is give a minor boost in progress. Time flys by so fast in this game its amazing, you can tweek all of sonics running physics and decrease or increase his speeds. The game is literally a sonic open world rpg with amazing graphics and visuals (if you can get past the first islands grass that appears off well the still grass at least) The boss fights are incredibly epic and the story is extremely interesting. I highly recommend this game to anyone if they are a sonic fan or not as it has great story, great action, amazing graphics and the game flows super smooth.",,

"Can't lie, not had a game that I've played in a long time where I didn't pay attention to what the time was, ended up checking after finishing the story and it's actually amazing, well worth that time and mechanics/plot is sick.",,
"I want to start with the thing that maybe 1% of all viewers of this review are looking for. If you already like Sonic games and are already a fan of the Sonic formula, then you'll probably like this game. If you do not feel you fit into that category, I do not think you are going to like Sonic Frontiers.

Here's the long version people can get very mad about. I am enabling comments and I am begging you to fight me. This game is a 6/10. And I think that's being generous. As you can see by my playtime, I played through every aspect of the game. I've completed every achievement besides one. That one achievement is just to engage phantom rush 50 times and I couldn't be bothered to figure out how close or far I was from that achievement, so I left it alone.

For everything Sonic Frontiers does right, it does something frustratingly wrong.

The free movement throughout the world feels very nice, and yet the objects placed within this world feel scattered about haphazardly, with no rhyme or rhythm or fluidity to the world. Rails and springs and speed ramps are found at every turn, and while these sections can be fun to go through - they don't feel like they're part of this world. They feel like the world was designed and then they were added after. Perhaps they should be part of a structure or a greater object so that they feel less like randomly sprinkled assets and more like there's a world here that I want to explore. Sonic Frontiers poses this idea of an interesting world that you might want to explore, but that world doesn't make any sense to exist, and it detracts a lot from the interest you may have while exploring. There are a few sections, particularly near some of the chaos emeralds, where Sonic Team does follow this design philosophy of an objects or entire structures that Sonic must scale or otherwise overcome. And I'll be honest, those sections are way more engaging and more fun and interesting and exciting. But they happen maybe five times in a world where these puzzles exist no less than 200 hundred times. When I say no less than 200 times, I'm sure I am undershooting the amount of these mini-sections that exist in the overworld. They are cool for roughly the first 10, then they become an extremely repetitive chore that has its value stricken down further by how unimportant they are. Why should I bother figuring out how to reach that collectable when I can literally find spots on the ground where I run in a circle and gain 8 of them in - and I'm not exaggerating - 1.5-2 seconds? Then when you decide, ""Hell, I'll just ignore them."" you'll be running by an unintentionally lock on to these mini-sections. What's that? You accidentally touched a single spring? Well, guess what, buckaroo. You're about to be bounced five steps deep into a mini-section and locked onto a 2D plane. You either must complete this section that you may have already completed or try to maneuver your way backwards so that you can get unlocked from this 2D plane and go back to trying to run in a completely different direction.

I think by far the worst part of Sonic frontiers are the actual stages. There are 30 of them in total. These stages are sad excuse for stages, and I kid you not, there are many sections that are longer. Sometimes one of the stages did not even take me 30 seconds to complete. They reused exactly 3 art styles for the entire game. You are either in Green Hill zone. Chemical plant zone. Or a city like level. Hope you liked those environments. You'll see them 30 times. There are, I would say. Three to four 3D stages that were kind of fun. I had wished those stages had been more flushed out and frankly longer. But at least they were enjoyable. And if I'm to say I enjoyed four out of 30 stages. I think that. Should be a massive indicator as to the mediocrity of the game. Now, inversely, of the 30 stages, there was only one stage that I thought was awful. Just a real stinker. So that means if you do the math, we have five good stages, if I'm being generous. 24 stages that are either so short or. Uninteresting that I hardly remember them and one stage that is frustrating and annoying, although fortunately it is also unbelievably short. The theme was Sonic frontiers. Everything's average. The whole game is just average.

I don't know how Sonic fans feel about the current voice acting in Sonic. Frankly, I think they can't agree on any single thing as a consensus so I'm sure this is contentious. I think Sonic's current voice does not fit Sonic. It's too deep, and it's not animated enough vocally, and part of that is absolutely the writing from Sonic Team. Knowing what a train wreck some of the communication from Sonic Team has been with voice actors and games like Sonic Adventure 2, I would go as far as to say it's probably largely Sonic Team's fault. But nonetheless, when I hear Sonic talk, it just does not feel like Sonic. Tails seems fine. Knuckles seems fine. Amy's voice is fine, although I think her writing is very weirdly paced. I just wanted to add this little section about how much I dislike the current voice of Sonic as a nice little extra section that will piss somebody off. A mini-section if you will. I'm sure someone has white-knuckle typed a comment in response to this review 3 paragraphs ago without having put a tiny modicum of thought into any of the words I have bothered typing here.

Keep in mind that I put 19 hours in this mediocre game. Because I love Sonic. I really like Sonic. I like the formula of Sonic, I like the character of Sonic, I like the art direction of Sonic, and every time a new Sonic game comes out, I just want it to be good. And while this Sonic game is a solid improvement over some of the previous Sonic Games (particularly Sonic Boom or Sonic Forces), I think this whole game is half-baked. At least unlike some previous attempts from Sega, the game is finished. It runs great on PC. I didn't have any performance issues besides pop-in. Great job to Sega for finishing the game. And technically it's sound, but it feels like the idea of the game was never finished before they started making it. I hope Sega keeps the direction of Sonic Frontiers. I hope that the seemingly positive reception of the game encourages them to continue making games in the style of Sonic frontiers. I think this can absolutely be a winning formula for Sonic. But Sonic frontiers itself? Does not execute on its own formula very well.

tl;dr

Keep the direction of Sonic Frontiers, but flesh out the map, world, and stages 10x more before you actually make another game.

P.S. The Big fishing section was better than at least 25/30 of the stages do not @ me.

P.S.S If you exclude the main story bosses, then I think of every Sonic game and Sonic spin-off ever made this is by far the worst score. Musical trainwreck.",,
"Thank you Sonic Team!! Now this game is far from perfect but it sure is a damn good game. This was the first time in a while where I have been able to sit down and play a game for multiple hours in one sitting. I was completely in the dark with this game up until today and I am beyond happy with how it turned out! I'm not a huge fan of the cyberspace levels & some of the 2d segments but it is totally made up for with all the 3d. The open world is super fun to just run around and explore, and I LOVE the combat mechanics and all the new abilities Sonic has! It has been so long since I have felt this feeling from a Sonic game and I really hope that Sonic Team in the future game pump out more games like this! ♡",,

Sonic Frontiers is a very unique Sonic title compared to it's recent releases and it excels in many ways. A captivating story that an Sonic fan can deeply appreciate from the letdowns in the past recent entries, there is some jank in terms of gameplay, but there's nothing that modding[gamebanana.com] can't fix. This game is one of the most perfect Sonic games in recent times, excelling in gameplay and soundtrack. Without it's jank it can be a 10/10, but with modding it, it automatically turns it into a definitive 10/10 for me. However some parts of the story later on in the game can be a little slow and some 2D like parts of the game but it wasn't a huge bother for me. I enjoyed Frontiers very thoroughly.",,
"Sonic Team desperately needed this game to be good. You can tell, because it IS good.

Of course, it's not perfect. You'd be hard pressed to find a game that is. Hopefully there will be a few changes and fixes along the way, but it doesn't need anything major because the game is finished. Impressive, right?

It looks like they threw a lot of different ideas into this game to find out which ones stick, and quite frankly, I'm ok with that. It's a good mindset to have so they know what works well moving forward. At the end of the day, it's a really fun game, and it's a breath of fresh air that the Sonic franchise desperately needed.",,

Hell of a Sonic game. Really REALLY FUN gameplay. The bosses are super cool. And the controls are slick AF. Havent played a sonic game since the late 90s and man. I am glad Sonic is back!,,
awesum game,,
"3 hours in and I am actually pretty impressed, its been too long since we got a good 3D sonic game. Frontiers gameplay has been very fluid and super fast so far. Story is typical but neat for a sonic game to be honest, Honestly cant wait to see what the modding community will do with this game in the near future.",,
"Easily my favorite Sonic Game, as far as gameplay, combat, and tone. I started with an early copy on Switch and have an even higher opinion of the gameplay now that I'm playing the game at a consistent 60fps. When starting the game, don't hold back and pick the advanced control options if you're a sonic vet. Gameplay is nearly 20hrs+, Denuvo is still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lame Sega, but that aside I'm really enjoying this and hope that we can keep this gameplay going forward. The soundtrack is incredible as well, best soundtrack since Sonic Unleashed. Overall I'd rate this a 9/10. Also, port Sonic Unleashed you cowards!",,

"so freaking good, finally an awesome 3D sonic game!! thank you sonic team. <3 2 issues I have is mouse camera movement is kinda shoddy and locked at 60 fps. I'm sure both of these are easily fixable though. Much love.

EDIT: found a way to unlock the frames and its so much better. 6 or so hours in now and man is this game good. Haven't had a single player game grip me like this in a long time ! Definitely worth picking up. :)",,
Best Sonic game since Generations. Absolutely worth the money,,
i like the kocos,,
this game is made by a team of people who have absolutely NO idea what they're doing,,
"SONIC IS BACK
SHONEN SONIC IS BACK I REPEAT
BUY THIS, IT'S THE BEST SONIC GAME IN YEARS",,
"Although it looks and feels like something that could have come out on the xbox 360, that doesn't mean this game isn't a blast to play. Easily the best 3D sonic game to come out since sonic adventure 2.",,
"From what I've played, the game seems incredibly fun. However, as you may have seen from some complaints, the game may crash on you whenever you try to scroll down the graphics option. I ran into this issue myself and it completely soured my experience. I recommend you follow the instructions in this thread to get it fixed, it worked wonders for me.

The game so far has been incredible. The plot is very intriguing and the gameplay is very tight and fun. I will update if anything changes, but for now, I think this is a W for the blue blur.",,
"The controls are a little bit stiff, but holy weiners this is the best modern Sonic game I've played in a long time
Breath of the Sonic

POST-COMPLETION UPDATE: I won't go back on my word that the controls are stiff (the physics are actually extremely clunky, especially in the Cyberspace levels...) but it's still a lot better than every other modern Sonic game released in the past 7 or so years. The Cyberspace levels themselves can have extremely easy or extremely difficult S-rank times, which is stupid. In addition, there wasn't as much content as was advertised; there was said to be ""20 hours"" of main-game content and the optional 100% requirements would take another 30-40 hours yet I 100%ed the whole game in just 23 or so. Still though, the soundtrack is amazing and the environments are vibrant. I would definitely recommend picking up this game, especially around this time since the price is now half off at most retailers (console only).",,
"As a big Sonic fan from a young age and having the constant ""The game looks empty and dull"" remarks flooding on pretty much all social media platforms, I was pretty skeptical about Frontiers, due to the disappointment of Forces. But I preordered Frontiers and was willing to give it a go.

4 hours in and the first area cleared when I posted this review? I gotta say.. SEGA knocked this one out of the park!

It doesn't feel like a Sonic game at all when you're in the open world. But there's such open space to run and it has that feel to it!
As you complete little sections on the map, it opens up grind rails and shortcuts to go back between old areas!
Cyberspace stages do feel like Sonic, but it's a nice nod back to the older fans!
People said that the areas looked empty. Enemies won't spawn until you're in close range, meaning you can enjoy the scenery!
On that, the attention to detail is beautiful! Rain pouring, day and night, flowers brushing aside as you boost through them!
Good music? Hell yeah! Each piece of music just works for where you're at. Be it in the open world, the loom in a cutscene, feeling the pressure of enemies. First proper boss battle music REALLY made it feel so intense!
Story so far felt a bit dark with what goes on in the first area. It works well though!

The combat system is a bit dicky at times, especially the parry. I had times where I thought I had the parry perfect but it was a miss. Besides that, once you've picked it up then you really want to get into a scrap!

The voice acting seemed better to me. I'm unsure if it was Roger Craig Smith doing Sonic still, but from Sonic and Amy speaking at this point, they sound more mature and grown up. The dialogue doesn't feel as cheesy as Forces did and keeps the humour in with the element of how dark part of the narrative is.

I'd definitely suggest picking it up and having a go on it. I can't wait to keep going on with the story!",,
"Only an hour in and i love it. Dont listen to any negative reviews because they are not true sonic fans, and honestly people are so entitled with new games they want so much and complain way too much, this game is definitely different and not perfect but its evident sega cares again and this game is awesome, i cant wait to play more.",,
"Few issues with the game
1. the cyberspace levels (not because they are short but because of the physics)
2. the digital deluxe purchase is fine, just accessing the artbook and soundtrack is such a terrible way to see the extra stuff

Overall the game is amazing",,
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES,,

"Had to update my review after playing the Final Horizon DLC.
Previously I gave it a seven out of ten, but now I'd give it an eight or nine out of ten.

Controls are great, and devs listened to feedback and gave us plenty of options to tweak the controls to make it even better that it was originally.

Music is great, made the boss battles much better (the boss battles are AMAZING btw). The inclusion of the jukebox mode and having songs scattered around as collectables is awesome.

Story is pretty good. It takes its time with each character to establish who they are and how they relate to sonic. Though it did seem a little odd how Amy doesn't seem romantically attracted to Sonic in this game. Perhaps she's finally over him. Sonic seems to act a little playful around her though, so there is affection.
... NOT THAT I CARE about any of that! <<>> Just an observation that they might be moving away from that, though I'll miss the comedy.

The environments weren't bad. There are three. I would have liked a few more, though I suppose Sonic Unleashed spoiled us with its variety.

The courses are far too easy. I would have liked better times to have to beat. Though I suspect I'll have to come back and remove this negative in case there are online leader boards or a harder difficulty that I've not found yet (only just finishing it again now since launch as my data somehow got deleted). The courses though are asset flips which is a real shame. They should have at least toned down the glitch aesthetic a bit and included much more variety, though I suppose that Sonic Generations had us covered for nostalgia. Would have been great to instead have new zones based on computer circuitry or something.

Graphics are top-notch for a sonic game.

What stops me from giving this a ten though is:
1) The voice acting for Sonic and Amy especially, followed by Tails wasn't great at all.
2) The open world areas have garbage EVERYWHERE (except for one zone). They really should have instead made environments naturally have the mini routes built in, perhaps relying on a cave system to hide the more complex puzzles if need be. I would have at least appreciated a setting to make sections disappear once you collected the memory token or whatever they are set up for.

Anyway, great game, and the DLC made it even greater by the addition of characters and increase in difficulty. Looking forward to the next entry with this formula.",,
good game,,
"Incredibly good, Can't say it's perfect but the speedrun potential is AMAZING and this is the best Sonic game in YEARS byfar. You may be disappointed by a few things, but the rest of the game outweights is for dang sure.",,
"Updated Review after completing the game on Hard:

Absolutely beautiful game. This game is a pure mix of Adventure lovers and boost lovers. I want to preface this with the fact I am a boost hater. But this game brought it back in a different fashion that didn't require me to EARN to be fast, rather, ""I AM FAST"". I always loved spin dash, because it was speed we had at all times to use. But now it's just unlimited boost (kinda).

With that said, the story is just peak fiction for what a Sonic game should be. We're back at the darker stories that have world building. This game being the origin story to the Chaos Emeralds is a great step in the right direction. It also tucks on our emotions a lot, especially the ending. I'm on board to see what more of Ian's writing will give us.





------------------------------------------------
I drop rolled into a rock and got stuck. 10/10
It gave me the good Sonic Adventure era glitches nostalgia. Hoping to find more stuff like this.

Video for context:",,
Sonic is BACK! This is best story i saw in Sonic games! I'm crying. Thx Sonic Team and Ian Flynn.,,
Best Sonic game I have played in years!,,
IN THIS WORLLDDDD!!!,,
"the best 7/10 ive played so far, dont be like me though, wait for a price drop",,
finally... a hit in 3d after so many years,,
This game is very fun unlike forces,,
"I think this has become one of my favorite games yet, especially for sonic, i have played almost 7 hours of it already and i have enjoyed all of it, yeah, the pop in is a little jarring at times, but other then that, i think this a fantastic sonic game, definitely recommend 8/10",,
"The fact this game exists feels like a dream, and I am living for it

Frontiers isn't perfect, but it's definitely a great game with an extremely promising framework
I hope they make a sequel, this holds so much potential for the franchise

Note: Play on Hard difficulty, Easy/Normal makes the game extremely easy",,
"Editing and finalising this review now that I have 100% the game in it's entirety (all achievements) and finished the final boss, which has an extra little secret if you beat it on hard! And holy hell this game is amazing, truly PEAK Sonic the Hedgehog for sure and I will say right now this is THE best Modern Era Sonic game to date, beats out Unleashed and Generations with ease. I'm giving it an easy 9/10 and here's why;

The music is phenomenal throughout the entire game (THOSE TITAN THEMES AND FIGHTS THOUGH!!!), the aesthetics and level design is top tier, the open word although empty feeling at times excels at making the game feel big and open and it definitely gives you lots to do and collect lots to do, there's also loads of mini bosses to find and defeat too which adds a bit of action to all the running and jumping you'll be doing.
The Cyberspace portion of the game however starts off strong but starts to really fall apart later in the game, the 3D levels are very fun but the 2D levels feel so weird and out of place, they're not bad but not great, the OST for them slaps though so that's a plus.

The combat is REALLY solid! The skill tree for the combat is small and can be fully upgraded quickly but it opens up so many cool combos and ways to defeat enemies and bosses it honestly doesn't matter that there wasn't much to upgrade, for a Sonic game that's also been the first to do anything like this it was really, really good. Then to add to the combat is the addition of Super Sonic and his main story boss fights, there's 4 in the game where you get to use him and IT IS THE BEST THING SEGA HAS EVER DONE, no joke those Titan fights are phenomenal, the music goes HARD and the whole thing is just so cinematic and fun and again if you play on hard you end up having Super Sonic do cooler attacks against the bosses during certain points in the fight, these can be missed so don't try to melt them if you want to check out those, I say to play on hard because you do less damage so getting these cinematic attacks is easier.

Now the story is better than any Sonic game we've had for a while in my opinion and it also focuses more on Sonic for once, even though some friends do show up throughout it still feels very focused on one thing and has a lot of that focus pinned on Sonic himself and I like that... but anyway yes anyone who likes a bit of the narrative side of Sonic games will enjoy this one a lot, I enjoyed it all the way until the end, literally, and the pay off is solid, can't fault the story because even if it has it's downsides it's more than what's ever been attempted before.
However one set back to beating this story and reaching the ""post game"" is that there isn't any, after beating the game that's it, no NG+ and no further unlocks afterwards, you just get sent back to before the final boss died so you can finish up on things you missed. I hope SEGA pull through and launch an update in the future with NG+ included or some kind of DLC perhaps, I don't know but I'd definitely love to see more for this game!

A few things I'd like to mention as well too after I got 100% for the game though is that it's incredibly easy to become overpowered and very early as well, you can literally spin in circles endlessly right off the rip and gain armour and attack upgrades for free, along with rings and memory fragments to unlock story elements, then there's Big the Cats fishing minigame which can net you all of the above and much more just for clicking A a few times, but it is a Sonic game and is targeted towards casuals and kids so becoming strong fast was to be expected, even on Hard mode the game is easy, very difficult to die, but do play on Hard, it's easily the best experience you can get and has again a secret at the end!

So to round this up, yeah if you're a big Sonic fan or maybe even a previous one and was unsure of whether or not you should try the game, DO IT, TRY THIS GAME IT'S REALLY FUN! You will love it trust me, it's the best Sonic game I think I've ever played and again I really do think it beats out Generations and Unleashed, it's awesome, only other Sonic game that could compete with this for my number 1 spot would be Project 06, but that's not really official so you know what that means? Haha, I couldn't be more happier with the game, congratulations Sonic Team and SEGA, Sonic is back.",,
"This game is amazing so far. It is everything I've wanted in a Sonic game for years. It isn't perfect by any means, but it is a definite step in the right direction. If Sonic Team keeps this momentum going then we may be in a new age of Sonic games.",,
"This was worth the wait, so far this is looking to be my favorite 3D Sonic game of all time!

UPDATE :

After beating the game, I can confidently say this is one of the most fun and memorable experiences i've had with a game and one of the first I wanted to 100%, def my favorite Sonic game I have ever played!",,
Best sonic game in the last 10+ years!!,,
BROKEN ASS DLC,,
Literally just peak fiction. My god this is the most fun I've ever had in a Sonic game,"Posted: November 8, 2022",
BEST SONIC GAME WITHOUT A DOUBT IN MY MIND IM SO HAPPY,,
"Aw yeah
This is happening!",,
"Worth every second of the wait, having an absolute blast so far",,
THIS GAME SAVED MY MARRIAGE,,
"I never thought I'd have this much fun with the open-zone concept. Please continue to evolve this new approach to Sonic in future Sonic games, I need and want more of it.",,
"In an open environment, running around at the speed of sound is naturally fun. The controls, for the most part, are tight and there's a plethora of content in the game. Character interactions are good, music rocks as usual for this series, but I do wish this game ran and performed a little better. Some pretty bad graphical issues on Steam Deck. Otherwise, good job Sonic Team! Hope the next one improves on this formula.",,
"I am a massive Sonic fan, and have been for about 5-6 years now...

It took me a while to warm up to it (maybe 15-30 mins to grasp the controls, see the aesthetic, be immersed in the world etc., but now I am loving it.

For 1, the writing is so so much better than Forces - jokes don't feel forced (pun intended), the story allows you to progress when you want to, and sometimes it's not always gotta go fast which is a better balance than just speed level after speed level.

2, I have the minimum required specs, and there were some issues with being ran on everything high graphics mode, however by turning graphics lower but keeping 60fps up makes you feel like you're the ""Super Sonic Speed"" that we're used to even if you're on minimum specs- so if you're having problems with graphics, this is an amazing custom setting for you!

3, the CGI cutscenes are well animated and the sounds/atmosphere with them are fun to watch

4, I haven't gone against all the bosses yet, but the ones I have done have all had their unique quirks, so you can't just beat all bosses with one singular combo type or move, so it makes enemies unique and you have to be decisive about your tactics

5, music as always - GORGEOUS. I play open world games like this slowly, and I thought I might get tired of the same open world tune, but the melody is so easy on the ears and changes with time of day (I think so far?) that it feels it can never become repetitive. The cyberspace breakcore is so upbeat and quick, it's perfect for feeling the true speed of the Blue Blur.

6, the levelling up system is new and pretty cool, i like that it doesn't just give you mega damage and speed off the bat, but rewards you with the time you put into it.

My only concern is that the cyber levels are very short (can easily do >1 minute) - it feels like a mix of the creativity of Colours but the length of Forces, so it could be better.
Sonic Adventure 2 is my favourite Sonic game, and I don't think the cyber levels here offer the beauty and creativity of those in the late 90's - mid 2000's, but they are definitely a step in the right direction from forces.

That's all for now!

PS. THE KOCO ARE SO DAMN CUTE <3",,
guud game,,
Why is level 1-2 the hardest level in the game,,
It has so many problems but i cannot deny how much fun and how much of a step in the right direction this is after the past 10 years. It feels like they care again,,
this ♥♥♥♥ still ass,,
"Peak fiction, real.

Wish it wasn't capped at 60 fps though.",,
"sonic = chun-li

good game

EDIT: i finished the game and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this is such a step up from the last game, which wasn't too hard since it was forces lmao, still has some jank but like every sonic game jank, you get used to it.

definitely recommend with gameplay mods as i had such a great time.

THE MUSIC WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ ITS TOO GOOD. I have yet to stop listening to the vocal themes and it's been a month since i beat the game.",,
"If you are a Sonic fan you NEED to play this game RIGHT NOW it's really good. If you are not a Sonic fan but want a fun open world game that makes you feel powerful, then you need to buy this game. This game really makes you feel like you are Sonic the Hedgehog. There are some flaws sure but they dont get in the way of the game and it's just really fun.",,
"I've been playing sonic for all my life and I'm a strong apologist for the 3d sonic games.

this is shaping up to be, without a doubt, the best 3d sonic game

update: after beating the game, I can say it's deserving of the 7's and 8's, but not much more. the game has some jankiness and some not very fun moments but the story and music gets really good and it maintains the fun almost all the way there

highly recommended if you're a sonic fan, semi-recommended if you like open world platformers",,
"A far better game than Sonic Forces. Its a fun open world game with classic Modern Sonic elements and feels like a genuine fun game. Though this is Day 1 release there are some bugs and glitches that need to be patched out. So far from what I've experienced, despite having VSync on the screen still tears during cut-scenes, animations for certain cut scenes go stiff (no moth animations when characters are talking), Game lags HARD whenever it rains in game and some awkward moments when wall running on the mountain side. But overall a fun Sonic Game.",,
"Don't waste your time on this game. It's better than Forces, but it's clear the PC port of this didn't receive much care at all. Between crashes and completely refusing to launch correctly, with no clear reason why or any simple fix, this game isn't worth buying.

I've jumped through many hoops trying to get the game to behave, but nothing keeps it from becoming unresponsive at launch. I blame Denuvo, but honestly it could just be that the devs need to take another look at this port. Was fun while it lasted, but this isn't Unleashed.

Edit: Anyone using certain bluetooth adapters and running into issues with this game, check and see if that causes any issues. I managed to find out that the dongle I was using (8Bitdo) was being flagged by Denuvo and making the game unresponsive.",,
Buy sonic mania instead. This game's jank ruins the fun. For an open world game it has less freedom than Mario Odyssey.,,
Denuvo DRM,,
this is the first game i've liked in years,,
A really fun sonic game with cool combat and combos,,
It's Breath of the Wild but fast and cooler.,,

Best sonic game Ive ever played and ive played most it has so much action and really good music its def worth the money even better on sale,,
now release sonic unleashed to pc,,
"Ok so I finally finished the game after hours and hours of grinding so what do I like from it
-I like how decent the story is and actually puts effort into compare to the past titles
-Super sonic scenes and game-play were fun and hyped me
-bosses were ok but they mostly looked quite meh

What I disliked
-Islands felt very empty with just platforms for you to collect memory tokens (Which holy crap last island makes you collect load of em which was really slow)
-Game gets quite boring with how slow it can be hell even forces had at least somewhat fast pace game-play.
-Spent a lot of time on island 3 with how stupid the quest were and found myself with useless keys due to completing all the missions

Honestly get this game when its on-sale and not when its full price since one of those hit or miss type games",,
sonc fast,,
"I hated sonic for a while cuz of his annoying ass lines and ♥♥♥♥ ""you're too slow"" he just got annoying overtime and the newer the games got the more banana kok it sucked so then this game comes out and blew my ♥♥♥ away. like holy felk sonic just got them bombo combos up this b and stages are fire the music makes me float of how good it is. the music in this game makes you feel like you are ascending to godhood and makes you feel like a superior being like a overpowered god facing multiple other divine cucks you need to ♥♥♥♥ up. great ass game graphics are nice and the glitches are sometimes a bit sloppy like a enemy made me clip through the map or there is a stage where nothing works when I wanna go fast af. but other than than a 9/10. Amazing game I recommend and ill ♥♥♥♥ off now.",,
"Being a Sonic fan since the release of Unleashed (still my favorite Sonic game), I can proudly say this is one of the best Sonic games.
Starting from the trailers released before the gameplay reveal we all were hyped but somehow Sega decided to give control to an IGN reviewer and suddenly the game was bad. Trust me, from a long-time Sonic fan and after Sonic Forces, this is a breath of fresh air - from the story (finally getting more serious), to the characters (even Eggman) and the immersive gameplay (open-world and cyberspace to please all players) you know you're going to have a fun time! I have this game 100% and it took me +- 20h and I completed it while playing the game normally so it's a really fun experience comparing to other games where you do the same thing over and over again.

And the most important and the essence of Sonic games, the soundtrack - EPIC, please listen to it and turn your music volume all the way up!",,
More fun than drunk driving,,
Pretty solid time all things considered. Definitely not one of the best 3D Sonic games but still had a good time and am very excited to see what they do with this formula going forward.,,
"Good open world style. Interesting and fun skills to acquire. Some songs on soundtrack are a bit cheesy, but otherwise go pretty well with some tracks.",,
"this thing looked pretty cool but wtf are these controls? the camera feels wrong, and i mean... P for pause menu? lol I didn't even know how to properly quit the game!! graphics are good i guess but it has this weird ""60""fps cap that made me feel sick immediately. apparently you need cheat engine to unlock the frame rate, but would it even be worth it?
mouse and keyboard feels like absolute ♥♥♥♥ tbh and the menus are INFURIATING lol hard pass, not for me at all",,
"If you like open world, akin to Breath of the Wild, with side missions and collectibles everywhere, pretty much a completionists dream, this is the game for you. The visuals are great and the game play is smooth. Well over 50 hours of game play if you try to do everything, Highly recommend.",,
"Sonic frontiers is a game that isn't bad, but should have been much more than what it turned out to be. This game suffers from a similar issue that the newer Pokemon game suffer from, that being the IP should be capable of producing a triple A experience, yet for whatever reason, doesn't deliver.

To put it simply, Frontiers feels like a very early PS3 game. a decent PS3 game, but none the less. Graphics are nothing to write home about. They get the job done but are pretty bland especially by today's standards.

Sonic's control is probably the tightest it's been since Sonic Adventure 2. Running around is extremely responsive and very satisfying. There are also several sliders in the options that allow the player to adjust them to their liking. It's ALMOST perfect, However, there is one major issue that greatly taints that possibility. Sonic has absolutely no momentum. If you let go of the control stick at any time, he stops on a dime, which feels really clunky. Adding to this is the fact that hills have no affect on Sonics speed. This just makes the overall experience feel cheap and unfinished, especially when you factor in the glitchy inconsistent physics.

The main gameplay consists of the following: run around completing small platforming challenges and puzzles scattered throughout the world and fighting the occasional mini boss, collecting gears and keys until you unlock a chaos emerald. There are also mini stages that follow the more traditional sonic formula called ""Cyber Space"". These levels are for the most part, copy/pastes from stages in previous games, except with worse controls. However I will say the few new stages are probably some of the best in the series in terms of design.

There's also a fishing mini game, very basic. Didn't play it much myself.

The combat is pretty fun, if not a little OP. Moves are easy to perform and have next to no limitations on their execution. For example, sonic has one move where you hold the L trigger to fire an infinite amount of projectiles. there essentially nothing preventing you from just using this move the entire time, making the other moves essentially useless. You can also spawn rings at any time, which adds to the easiness.

Story is... fine. Very forgettable. kind of all over the place and cut scenes just sort of play at random times out of nowhere and don't really make sense in the context of the game. The voice acting is pretty good, though Sonics voice took some getting used to for me. Sage's voice was definitely the highlight of the cast though.

The boss battles... these are definitely the highlight of the game. All I will say is if you've ever played Metal Gear Rising, these battles are ALMOST as hype as the ones from that game.... Until you get to the final boss.... Which is literally a stupidly difficult Bullet Hell mini game that was already played several times before. Probably the worst final boss in the series, and arguably one of the worst final bosses I've ever played.... Extremely disappointing considering the previous boss battles.

Overall, I'd give the game a 6.9. Doesn't deserve a 7 because it's a triple A game, so I expect a triple A experience. Not some half-assed dated game that's ""OK"". With that said, I do still recommend the game if it looks interesting to you. It's worth playing once at least.",,
"Quick and simple recommendation:

Sonic Frontiers is perfect for Sonic fans; everyone else, your mileage will vary.


The longer version:

Sonic Frontiers is distinctly a ""decent"" game, something that gets the job done, but will not win any awards. So why does it (at the time of this review's writing) have ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" reviews?

SEGA and Sonic Team's previous, recent offerings (i.e. Sonic Forces), suffered from being buggy messes with cringey, horribly dubbed dialogue, bad storywriting, frustrating gameplay, and terribly short play time (using Sonic Forces again, it lasted only 4 to 6 hours). A few of them were examples of ""neat idea, horrible execution"" while others were just plain bad all around. The only decent Sonic games put out tended to be mostly third party affairs (Sonic Mania, Sonic Origins), and that didn't stop SEGA from self-sabotaging those to varying degrees.

Frontiers is notable for breaking this trend. Gameplay is decent -- nothing special, but fun to blast through. The idea of action-RPG combat is a good idea for a Sonic game, especially since the Sonic-style speed platforming tends to be finicky (requiring lots of developer time to make but producing very short minutes-long, mostly cinematic segments). But the enemies for most of the game are too simple to defeat once you realize what specific move their weak against, so most of the combat is simple (though the proper inclusion of Sonic gameplay elements, such as rails, into some mini-bosses is actually well-done). The base story is nothing new, but Ian Flynn (one of the lead writers of IDW Publishing's Sonic comics) put together dialogue and story beats that make the characters sound natural, fun, and serious when they need to be -- portrayals of the classic characters that fans have been waiting for a long time, rather than the inconsistent caricatures of prior games. I have yet to encounter a gamebreaking bug, and the worst fun-breaking bug was a single instance of an enemy pushing me through the ground and falling to my death. But with the minimization of bottomless pits, the removal of the classic limited lives system, and the reduced length of the ""speed gameplay"" segments (the cyberspace levels), the gameplay is significantly less frustrating than Sonic Forces, Sonic Generations, or event he classics like the Adventure series (Adventure 2 in particular is where I gained my hate for bottomless pits in platformers). And the game is unexpectedly long -- my playthrough was 20 hours, and I estimate the average player will range from 10 to 20-ish based on how much of the optional stuff you do.

And, of course, like the majority of Sonic games, the soundtrack is great.

The biggest flaw of Frontiers is the graphics quality, which is poor for a triple-A game nowadays. Texture quality varies, and for an open-world game with long sight-lines, the game features an embarrassing level of pop-in for objects (the base environment objects, such as rocks and trees do fine, but the intractable ""jungle gym"" objects -- such as rails and platforms -- fade-in when you get close, so an open sky suddenly turns into a clutter of floating objects as you zoom across the landscape).

Gemaplay-wise, Frontiers is the most accessible for newcomers to the franchise, and the most enjoyable and least frustrating for Sonic fans.

Story-wise, Frontiers is made exclusively for Sonic fans.

The Sonic universe is notable for how disconnected its entries are from each other, and how its background lore ranges from nebulous to never used. Only the Archie comics ever managed to link all the Sonic lore together (though the attempt suffered from extreme weirdness in the writing department). Otherwise, the Adventure series (Adventures 1 and 2, Sonic Heroes, and Shadow the Hedgehog) is the only time Sonic lore had any level of continuity and consistency.

Sonic Frontiers changed that by incorporating lore and references to nearly every single modern title, including some minor references to the IDW comics (and even the Sonic Boom TV series, of all things!). In fact, one can consider Frontiers a sequel to the Adventure series. It even provides background lore for some key McGuffins of the franchise (you can guess what they are). Characters are now finally aware of their past selves, get some character development, and there is even some digs at SEGA/Sonic Team's inconsistent character writing from previous games. This is the kind of stuff Sonic fans have been waiting for for a very long time.

But, the downside is that the game makes no attempt to initiate newcomers to this mountain of lore, spread out over many years of games. In fact, the start of the game is barely an introduction to anything -- you are very quickly thrown into the story with barely any preamble. Which is fine for a Sonic fan like me, but I doubt it will be as enjoyable for someone unfamiliar with the franchise.

At a bare minimum, to enjoy the story of Frontiers, you need to have played (or watched a playthrough of) Sonic Adventure 1 and Sonic Adventure 2. To get any additional references, you need to be aware of the stories of Sonic Heroes, Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic Lost World, and Sonic Forces.


Conclusion:

Are you a Sonic fan? If yes, buy this game and have fun! You won't regret it, because even with its flaws, Frontiers has much of what we've been waiting for and SEGA/Sonic Team needs to understand that they did something right for once.

If no, wait for a sale. And if you want to enjoy the story more, get your hands on the Steam versions of Adventure 1 and 2 and play them first (and probably install some mods with the help of a guide -- the PC ports are based on some badly done Gamecube ports and you won't get the original experience without mods).",,
Sonic Frontiers is a game that i like but it still needs to be more polished in my opinion and the game needs fixes still for sure but other than that i like the game and will recommend it but at a lower price like $50 or $40 not $60 i think it is still not good enough to pay $60 for it but other than that it is a good sonic game and one of the best 3D Sonic games yet.,,
"7/10 - Fresh new Sonic experience that while feeling pretty good, still feels a bit like an experiment. Felt like if you took Sonic's story from SA1, remove the stage variety, given the Cyber Space levels are all built around a few templates, and made the ""adventure stages"" (Mystic Ruins, Station Square, etc) much bigger and all based around Mystic Ruins lol, plus a solid combat system.

I feel like the controls are a bit slick at first, but you get used to them after a hour or so, then it becomes pretty smooth, although I miss having a dash on the 2nd jump, instead now needing to burn boost and hope you don't overshoot if you're trying to get a few extra feet of distance.

Overall really enjoyed the game but anyone saying this is better than SA2 clearly never played more than 15 minutes.",,
"boy where do i start with this game. this is at least tied with generations, at best my favorite sonic game for me. definitely has issues but the pros heavily outweigh the cons. this game at its core is an apology from sonic team and a prayer for the future.

Pros:
-Amazing gameplay in the open zone
-Incredible ost (i mean its a sonic game what did you expect)
-Great story with several (mostly) unintrusive callbacks to the older games
-Combat that actually requires brain usage, a first for the series
-Momentum returns. You dont need to abuse it as much as the adventure games but it sure as hell is still there.

Cons:
-Jank. mostly the good kind of jank but its very intrusive at points ESPECIALLY on the 3rd island.
-lots of grinding needed to progress. especially bad in the last stretch of the game.

The elephant in the room cons:
-Denuvo
-The cyberspace stages are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful im sorry its green hill for the millionth time its terrible level design in some and the physics do not compliment these at all

TL;DR good game and sonic has a bright future if this keeps up.",,

"this is somehow the best 3D sonic game while also being the game devs' testing ground for future games. the response to player feedback from twitter is really great. so great in fact, the director unliked titty sucking porn due to player feedback! it's far from being a perfect game but it makes me excited to smell what this team cooks next.",,
"Long time Sonic fan here, in fact my first game was a Sonic game. I was raised with Sonic Adventure, Heroes, Riders, and many more, mostly 3D games.

--{Short}--
This is a great experience overall, as an old Sonic fan, I will HIGHLY recommend this game! Best Sonic game in my eyes. Please don't look for spoilers, or any of the boss music, trust me on this one. If you are a Sonic fan, please play on Hard, and high speed mode(generally recommend this to any gamer). The game can get hard at times.

--{Long}--
This is going to get long, let me explain my experiences from previous Sonic titles compared to Frontiers. There is simply nothing like Frontiers, like at all! Sonic Frontiers at first game me Sonic Adventure and Unleashed vibes, but that was when it was still unreleased. Now that it is out, and I've completed it, and almost finished all of my achievements(50 phantom rush is remaining). This game is just different and unremarkable!

In Sonic Adventure, you play as Sonic against a boss and then a stage, and then you are greeted to a hub world. You are greeted with small environment which held stages and travel points to other areas. In Unleashed, you are given 2 hub worlds, slow pace one, and stage containing one, which is the fast one. Both are small, and insignificant to the main meat and bones of the games: the levels and bosses.

In Frontiers, to call it a hub world is an insult, and calling it an open world will be disappointing. The wording of 'open zone' makes sense once played. To call it a playground is also insulting once you progress to the game. The map is small, yet not so small. You will see waypoints and markers showing kilometers, but are easy to reach. Yes, kilometers(could be counted on one hand with fingers).

In this map, you got, enemies, mini-bosses, larger mini-bosses, puzzles, and a ton of story related items, which take you their own routes, which at beginning are simple, but as you progress, they improve heavily. There are 2 more things in there too: Cyberspace(Boost levels), and fishing with Big the Cat.

You can also fight like in Sonic Fighters and Unleashed. It has skills, and you have to learn their combos. They are cool to pull off and don't feel boring for the duration of this game. My advice, learn to parry, serious you will need it!

I took 18 hours to finish this game, however I rushed it a bit in the end. It is a very long game, and is quite engaging. I like to also remind everyone that I reviewed this game differently compared to other Sonic games. It is being reviewed in its own league, so if I don't; everything will be mostly 10/10, minus Cyberspace, final boss(shocker I know), and the utilization of the 4th Island.



--Skills (8/10)
Though limited in number, they are sufficient for the game, and don't feel too repetitive.

--Normal Enemies (9/10)
Good range of normal enemies, which are the usual grunts, and other smaller ones. The grunts do improve over the game, so don't underestimate them. The Cyberspace enemies also count as well here.

--Mini-Bosses (9/10)
Perfect amount of difficulty, and a direct step up from the normal enemies. while not ridicules and large in scale, they are soft increase of difficulty without making the game annoying to play. The variation are enough to make the game engaging.

--Larger Mini-Bosses (7/10)
There is a good amount of them, some are large, and some are very large in scale, or just large as in the battle duration. They are interesting bosses, with unique quarks, tricks and weaknesses. They are for the most part grand and awesome to look at and play...once. The problem here is that some of the bosses are just too tricky or too annoying to deal with, making their replayability lower, as they are harder to beat. They are amazing bosses, but some of them are just annoying. It is like, Knuckles stages, except that they are fun to play, but annoying to finish.

-- Island Bosses (10/10)
Let me tell you something, go in blind for them, music and everything. When it was leaked, I am glad that I avoided them all. Trust me on this.

-- Cyberspace (7/10)
I know that is a higher score than expected. The Cyberspace levels are just shortened re-imagines of older games, but the final Island's ones is the only reason it is 7, without them, it will be 5. They are short and ok, I will prefer some over Forces(not talking about the finish Island ones), but not all of them.

The final island Cyberspaces are original, and just good, some are short, and some are just long, which is 2 minutes by minimum long. Very good levels.

The gameplay style used is a bit unfitting for boost levels.

-- Islands (9/10)
Amazing, the first island is a starter, which is to be expected that it is a bit barren, but the two Islands ahead are 10/10. They are well built, and well designed. The 4th Island is the 1st Island's area that you can't explore(I know it is a spoiler, but I will not let Sonic Team walk away from this). The 5th is simple in landscape, but much more complex than the first island by a large margin.

-- Island Clutter (9/10)
If Cyberspaces are disappointing, then the islands themselves have mini-levels, hundreds of them, which are progressed quality.

-- Story (8/10)
Remember that I won't review this compared to other titles? That is why it is at 8/10. It has a good story with a great amount of consistency from older titles, while bringing a new story, with a lot of lore, and I mean A LOT of lore. It is engaging regardless you know Sonic's lore or not. However, Sega is a bit confused on the area of lore right now. They mentioned something that didn't, and shouldn't even be in the Modern Sonic Game Canon. Make of that as you will, I will be neutral on that. It failed to give an emotional impact, and created a new relationship(not shipping) without going deeper into it. It lacks in its own ways, but at least the character interactions are top notch.

-- Graphic (6/10)
For a late 2022 game, nothing impressive. Literally nothing impressive. Also lacks a draw distance slider, and more graphic options. There are some pop-in here an there, and draw distance is annoying when on grassy hills, and looking for routes of the rails to reach other places.

-- Music (9/10)
Top tier, however some of the Cyberspace musics are forgettable.

--Puzzles (10/10)
For a Sonic game, it is plenty, and requires some brain power. It can be harder or easier than Genshin Impact's ones(mostly easier). Don't expect steep difficulty of puzzles. Easy, engaging, short, nailed it quite well Sonic Team.

-- Gameplay (9/10)
Fun, and enjoyable. Play for at least 3-6 hours to truly understand the full scope of what I mean.



--{Final Verdict}--
8.5/10

[-Rushed Final Boss] (-0.5)
[-Low amount of Cyberspace, or low quality]
[-Bad utilization of the 4th map] (-0.5)
[-4 themes of Cyberspace]
[-Mini-games are not open world]


--{Areas of improvement}--
[Time changer, as some missions are at night. Very annoying]
[Replayable Island Bosses]
[Graphical and technical ones, especially draw distance]
[4th map, remove it and make it limited time for story, and make it a part of the 1st Island, but unlockable later]
[We said it before, and we will say it again, don't rush! That final boss is rushed]
[Music changer]
[Photomode]
[Mini-games around the world]
[Cyberspace]


-- +Update 3 Verdict--
9/10


Compared to other Sonic games, it is easily the most fun, and expansive one. It is debatably the best. Once you fully play it, you can't compare it to other Sonic games, because it is quite different, and large in scope. This is an amazing step for the future of the Blue Blur!

Have fun if your buying!

PS. SEGA, please increase Sonic Team's budget and developer count. This is a very difficult and time consuming path for Sonic Team to undertake. It took too long to be developed(early 2019 - late 2022), and I believe Sonic Team is undermanned for future tasks, as now you have set a new bar for Sonic games.",,
"The story is about as bland as any Sonic game, it's not really that enthralling. Just cut-scene after cut-scene doubling down on the fact you need to get the Chaos emeralds and free your friends. No real narrative. If you like to grind away for collectables, then you may enjoy it. Defeat enemies to get level-ups to defeat bosses to collect cogs to play levels to collect keys to unlock chaos emeralds to progress... plus all the other side-collectables. You also need to collect ""memory tokens"" to unlock the story further.

The levels themselves are all copy and pasted from Sonic Generations. Even the level layouts are largely identical. There's only 4 level ""tropes"" that I have encountered in 8 hours of gameplay, these are ""Green Hill"", ""Chemical Plant"", ""Sky Sanctuary"", and ""Speed Highway"" - all from Sonic Generations. These tropes are reused over and over again. The levels just feel the same.

All last about 1 minute. You get keys for doing 1. Completion of the level, 2. S Rank, 3. 30 rings+ and 4. Collecting all 5 red rings. This is easy enough to do in your first try in 99% of the levels, until you encounter a broken level where S rank is barely possible due to the weird timings set.

The physics are incredibly twitchy compared to previous ""Hedgehog Engine"" games and feel broken. This is probably to account for the multitude of new mechanics in the overworld.

Basically, the Sonic levels are an afterthought, and in fact are just one tiny part of the larger cog. Sonic Team don't want to make Sonic games anymore - and that's fine - but let somebody else take over who does, is all I can say. This feels more like a spin-off game with a AAA budget than an actual Sonic game.",,
vrum vrum katchau skrrrrr,,
i love you sonic,,
he's pretty fast,,
music makes me want to lift a mountain fr,,
"There are a few problems with the game, like the camera not always playing nice or a minor amount of jank in moments where it matters, but I feel it's more important to remember that these are issues that SEGA is likely aware of and can easily fix. And besides the present issues, I can say after 5 1/2 hours and 100% the first island that this game is completely worth it. Music, graphics and gameplay are an absolute treat and I strongly feel that negative reviews of the game so far are being blown out of proportion. I'd even say the 7/10 scores I've seen are fairly underselling the game. So far it's at least an 8.5 and with some minor fixes can easily reach a 10. Looking forward to playing more.",,
"Okay.... this game is freakin' amazing for several reasons:

1) Nintendo is allowing it to exist in this form-- there is some serious Breath of the Wild ""inspiration"" here. Good lord, I didn't know it would be so blatant! All the sounds, effects-- it's staggering.

2) It's actually a good game (so far)! Shocking beyond belief. It's so fun just to move around. Zero bugs. Zero confusion on what or where to go. (edit after a few more hours: Okay there's definitely some 'jank' especially in the open world movement, but it's not BROKEN and really doesn't bother me, it's extremely momentary and infrequent)

3) Multiple options (and suggested settings) for motion sickness, which was my major concern going into a 3D game like this.

What a nice surprise. Good job, Sonic Team!

*edited out extra dumbs.",,
"This update reminded me of why I uninstalled this game. So clunky and damn these ""challenges"" are obnoxious. Also not looking forward to the new stages judging from how bad the first one was, not too bothered about 100%ing everything but this game just feels much more tedious than fun.
Edit: Gonna add that I'm looking forward to the super sonic transformation mod getting updated so I can trivialise this ♥♥♥♥ lmao
Edit 2: completed near enough everything after around 2 days of doing the initial review, was easy enough as usual (since difficulty means it was the challenge that made you work, not the buggy/clunky crap around it) and I just can't find this game fun without mods, or at least I found the base game pretty fun but the new final boss has a pretty big design flaw. Who would've thought that you had to sidestep after attacking to get that damn cord imo",,
I would love to see this sonic in a smash game.,,
"My hardware is better than the requirements listed on the page, but the game struggles to make even 15 frames per second.
That is, of course, when the game isn't crashing in the settings.
No idea if this has to do with Denuvo or the game being poorly optimized, but either way it runs like garbage.

I'd suggest a hard pass on this game right now, hopefully they'll patch the performance issues later.
If you need to play this game, it's probably best to get on console.
It's a shame because the more I play the more fun it feels, but the performance holds it back.",,
"Much more fun than you would expect given the pre-release trailers. Open world has some flaws, like it's a giant pain trying to just navigate somewhere when random boost pads lock your camera on a set path to try and get a collectible you already have way too many of, and it has the worst (hard mode exclusive) final boss of any Sonic game I've played, but overall I really enjoyed my time playing it.

Highly recommended to anyone that enjoyed the exploratory parts of Sonic Adventure 1. Aside from the final hard mode boss, bosses are great (if a little too heavily scripted at times, can sometimes be a bit on-rails) and the theme music to accompany them is the strongest the soundtrack has been in 20 years.

Not recommended to anyone looking for linear levels. They're few and far between and recycle the Sonic Generations assets for the 3rd game in a row. The only noteworthy thing about them is that some are pretty close recreations of classic 3D Sonic levels, like a near perfect Green Forest and Metal Harbor from SA2, but with it limited to recycled Generations assets the references might just go straight over your head at first glance since it'll visually look nothing alike.",,
"Solid game! It's the most fun I've had playing a Sonic game in a very, very long time and honestly some of the most fun I've had all year was playing this. That being said, this game does have problems; it has a general lack of polish and it can feel more than a little jank at times, but the good definitely outweighs the bad in my opinion, including that this game has one of my favorite Sonic soundtracks.

I will say this, I do recommend listening through the Egg Memos and doing side activities in general. The memos in particular add a lot to the story and I honestly feel like some stuff from those memos should've been included in the main story.",,

WOW! My thoughts on Sonic Frontiers huh? Ok..where do I start 😂
Kronos Island first impression: Am I playing a Sonic game set in the Death Stranding world? Coz it sure looks like it with the realistic world and mellow music. Which is not a negative point in the slightest bit as I've played Death Stranding before Sonic Frontiers.

I absolutely loved how Sonic and all of his pal friends looked. Sonic is kinda a mixture between classic and modern Sonic. I'm pretty surprised they brought the attitude back in Sonic and it shows in the dialogues. The banter between Sonic and his friends is what I had come to expect since I've known Sonic back in 1992-1994 (when I was in standard 3/4 primary school) and read Sonic The Comic which ran in the UK. I've always known Sonic as the hedgehog with an attitude!

I had tons of fun just running at top speed in the open world island. Doing the many platforming obstacles was such a good distraction and was never a chore since most of them are well-designed. The challenges with the question mark (?) breaks up the pace and I thoroughly enjoyed doing all of them including fighting the guardians. I think the approach to taking down the guardians like a form of puzzle-solving is pretty neat!

Ooooh and once you get to the boss fights which is against the Titan! Whoo-boy! When the head-banging kickass song kicks in, things get really intense really fast! Oh my god -those fights againt the Titans as Super Sonic is one of the best moments in a Sonic game...EVER! It was soooo wickeddddd! 🤘🤘🤘

As you can tell I had loads of fun playing Sonic Frontiers while livestreaming on Facebook here. I am a Sonic fan since 1992 and I'm glad he's still in top-form and popular now more than ever and not just to me, but also with my kids! Picture that for a second...it's mind-blowing stuff y'all 🤯

My final thoughts on Sonic Frontiers: One word...WHOLESOME! Never a dull moment all thanks to Sonic Team and Sega for going in a refreshing direction whilst telling a compelling story to boot! I simply can't get enough of the new character, Sage and hope to see more of her in future Sonic games!",,

There are nitpicks I do have about this game. There's a lot of pop-in stuff, and the camera sometimes goes just a little bit funky, but at the end of the day... it's a Sonic game and I'm having fun! I have a strong sense that if you like open-world games (well, ""open-zone"" I guess) as well as colorful platformers with eye-candy graphics (pop-in aside) then you'll love this game!",,
he's back,,
The best sonic game ever,,
"The best Sonic game in over a decade. But that's not saying much.

This game reminds me a lot of Pokemon Legends: Arceus. It's clearly rushed, broken, thematically disjointed, cobbled together, ripping ideas from Breath of the Wild, and reusing assets from prior games in the series. The story is also pretty lame and dumb, as usual. But even with all that, the gameplay itself has a weird flow that no other Sonic game has gotten right, and when it's at it's best, the game really brings out the potential of a Sonic-speed adrenaline rush, reacting to obstacles just in time to keep your rocketing momentum going.

Yes, it's got issues. But if you can look past them, it has tons of potential. If the series continues to refine this formula, Sonic has a bright future.",,
"It's one of the good ones.

Honestly, I'd put this game on-par with Colours and Generations, in both their strengths AND their flaws. Frontiers 'aint a perfect game by any means - but what Sonic game is, honestly? Even still, a game doesn't have to be perfect to put a grin on my face for pretty much the entire experience. Even the part I expected to be mediocre (the Cyberspace levels) turned out to actually be quite fun.

I definitely know I'll be coming back to replay this one later, just like I do with Colours and Generations.

Surprisingly few bugs too - I can only remember three, and two of them are just sometimes rings rotate sideways, and the shader on the chaos emeralds only seems to work twice a second, causing them to be in two places at once. As for the major bug... I once boosted off a ramp and Sonic just decided that his people needed him, and I ascended forever. And yes, weird floating point glitches DO occur after you fly so far. Sonic's model gets real warbly after 1,000,000 units of distance. Though gonna be honest, that bug was and only added to the enjoyment of the game (plus, I could just fast travel or reload my save at any time to get back to solid ground, so it's not like I was up there)

Edit: Hoo boy Update 3 sure is bad though",,

"Finally a good Sonic game

Gameplay is fun, music is good as always, and the story is so far good.

PC port though however is very barebones and lacks a lot of the typical PC settings. Why the hell are the only 2 FPS settings 30 and 60??? Also please get rid of Denuvo for gods sake.
On steam deck it runs okish when forced on experimental and capped at 30fps with everything at low. Few dips here and there probably cause of Denuvo

after finishing the game i can say the game is a solid 8/10 but 8.5/10 with mods",,
"Best 3D Sonic game since SA2B. I think Colors and Generations could be argued but I enjoyed the atmosphere and soundtrack a ton. It's not super long, you can 100% the game in 20-25 hours as of now. Love the direction the franchise is heading, good game!",,
The 5 year wait was worth it.,,
Sonic is finally good again,,
"This game is weird as hell. I recognize why many have praised it, but in my opinion, I don't think this game brings more good than bad for the future of this franchise. Sonic controls terribly in this game. He is so slow that it's worth considering whether speed is a fundamental part of Sonic the Hedgehog's character anymore-- he doesn't go fast very often in cutscenes, he doesn't talk about his speed or really utilize it, and now, he doesn't even really use it in gameplay. The only way you may gain a semblance of true speed is to spam (not hold, but spam) the Boost button, as ONLY the initial few frames of Boost actually increase your speed significantly, with a harsh dropoff mere seconds after the start. By default, a momentum system does not seem to be present in this physics engine. Sonic does not interact with the terrain in his movements (he isn't slowed by inclines or quickened by slopes), and does not carry any speed into the air. From a technical standpoint, you viscerally feel that every action you can take or interactable you interact with is directly setting Sonic's ""speed"" value to a specific number. Save for gravity, I could honestly be convinced that Sonic is not a physics object in this game-- no forces other than gravity seem to act on him. Sonic has no acceleration, he almost instantly accelerates and decelerates according to your input (worse, if you let go of the stick, Sonic stops near-instantly with no decelerate animation, as if he is friction-less). You may tweak much of this behavior slightly in the game's ""game settings"" menu (a welcome first for a game of its type, let alone a Sonic game), however all of it does far less than you'd expect, with the only meaningful option in my experience being the baffling toggle to allow Sonic to carry speed from a Boost into a jump, a default behavior in literally any other Sonic game. The inclusion of this as an option leads me to believe Frontiers is the official departure away from the idea that Sonic is a physics-based character. Rolling down hills, Spindash jumping over terrain, Boost jumping across bottomless pits-- none of these things are possible without heavy tweaks and HedgeModManager codes in this engine.
And all of this is only to comment on the 3D open zone gameplay, which is insane, because that is where Sonic controls the best by orders of magnitude.
The 2D sections in both Cyberspace and the open zone are awful and straight up not fun. Sonic is slowed from what is in the open zone already a shell of his former morning jog speed in Unleashed to a literal crawl, with your speed being locked with a harsh and uncomfortably low cap. Worse, Boost is functionally disabled-- it doesn't change your speed AT ALL in 2D. This is not hyperbole, the speedometer does not change.
I don't know why Sonic Team still holds fast to the idea that Sonic needs to be a 2.5D hybrid platformer. In Unleashed, the 2D sections at least maintained near parity with how Sonic handled in 3D, the only difference being that your speed was sometimes capped a little slower than in 3D. In Generations, these 2D sections were rendered entirely useless and redundant by Classic Sonic. In Forces, I would apply the same logic, except they utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Classic Sonic's physics in Forces, so 2D Modern Sonic is really the only playable sections. I should've known Classic Sonic in Forces was a warning of what was to come.
Cyberspace takes the already lackluster control from the open zone and asks ""what if it was worse?""
In Cyberspace, by default, your speed is capped at 1/3 of its open zone max. Your turning radius is completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for some reason (you can trace the unit circle outline of your analog stick even while Boosting? It's like you have no forward momentum), and Boost does almost nothing.
It is laughable to me that Cyberspace levels are taken from past games-- one of the levels is that section from Generations Modern Green Hill where you do the rail grinding stuff in 2D, except it barely works in this game and feels awful because you cannot gain speed. What was a 20 second portion of the stage is lengthened to 1m20s because you move at 1/4th the speed.

The rest of the game is fine. The combat is boring and uninteresting, it's exactly the same as Shadow in Sonic 06 except the harder you mash the attack button the more flashy cutscenes you get to watch. They're well animated, but the fact that the homing attack is no longer a movement tool but a combat tool (and inherits the delay and hit-pause/hit-stop of combat) makes homing attack chains in platforming feel slow and heavy. The story is serviceable. It's cool to have cutscenes and dialogue in a Sonic game that isn't actively painful to listen to or utterly nonsensical, but in my opinion it's not great. Unleashed felt like the last time a narrative of any kind was attempted in this franchise and I'm glad to see a return to that. Now if the narrative could be good, that would be awesome.
The open world is really boring. The obstacle courses that pop-in even on high end PCs are just flat out less enjoyable that simply running around the truly empty open zone. It's like that one Sandbox mod level in Generations.
I don't know, this game is a 4.5/10 for me. The game isn't overtly unenjoyable but every second I spend controlling Sonic here is a second I'm not spending in Generations, Unleashed, Adventure, or Adventure 2.",,

"the gameplay feels normal again and you can actually control where sonic goes easily! the story feels fleshed out again, knuckles is finally not stupid, amy is actually a character now, and tails is finally learning to be independent again! the only complaints i have about this game is the fact that sonic has NO momentum. and his jump completely stops his speed. other than that though, this game is amazing! and the titan bossfights, OH. MY. GOD. Incredible. i will leave it to you to find out how insanely good these are. They feel like a final boss event, almost as hype as the dark giah final boss. overall, great story but needs a bit more to it, good control but bad physics, kind of empty, and the combat feels decent.",,
"I loved the base game and the updates up to a point, but the back half of the third update is just badly designed and unfairly difficult.

The story-mandatory final trial is incredibly difficult on all three difficulties, requiring you to face all three major bosses back to back with your stats reset to level 1, and the removal of rings in all three fights. You also can't normally parry attacks you could in the base game, and most of the boss attacks weren't designed for the perfect parry system, and are often quite buggy.

The new final boss also expects the player to intuit how to do things the game has never expected from them up to that point, and actively makes it harder to do those things when the combat and lock-on systems are not designed for the amount of precise control it feels like it requires.

Play the base game, watch the DLC cutscenes on youtube. The Final Horizons update isn't worth playing unless they fix the issues.",,
"A bit of my story with Sonic first:

I started playing Sonic games with the 3D ones on Gamecube. I actually have and played them all on this console! I played a few on Wii that I really liked despite being completely different, but I was getting nostagic of those I played back then when I discovered the blue hedgehog.

I didn't play any of the new games after the ones on Wii, but heard they weren't that great and that the 3D game series was slowly sinking. Hope seemed lost for the 3D sonic games, which I was pretty sad to hear!

Until they announced Sonic Frontiers that I didn't spoil myself of despite the very first trailer they released. It looked like an open world Sonic. I love Open worlds! and I always dreamed, back when I was playing the first Sonic Adventure, to have an open world Sonic game! I was hyped, and put all my hopes in it.

Now for the review of the game.

As a 3D Sonic fan, I have to say I am extremely happy of what they did with this game. Sonic feels great to play, the story, while being rather simple, keeps making reference to previous games like if it was trying to create a new base of the lore to work on, and gosh it's pretty! Not even talking about the amazing OST they made (I'm nominating the game for its soundtrack in the steam awards)! The game isn't really big though and there is no achievement for collecting every single item in the maps (which I did), but those mini parkour sections are pretty fun and satisfying!

Overall, I feel Sega and the Sonic team really wanted to create a new base for the Sonic franchise with this game, and I think they did it very well! The canon is settled, the gameplay is there, the characters are evolving... They made a great base that they need to expand from, and hopefully they do it right! Can't wait to see what they have in stock!

One bad thing about the game though, despite being rather small: the voices. Gosh, only Tails and Big have a voice that match what we're used to hear x) Voice actors on Youtube do a much better job at it I find x) They should have hired them instead!",,
"Okay so Sonic frontiers was rather a strange game because it wasn't like any other Sonic game, not saying it was bad but it was still strange.

Sonic the hedgehog is that one franchise in which if they disappoint me with one game, I will still be hyped for the game that's gonna come out after that, and as a HUGE Sonic the hedgehog fan I was extremely excited for this game, even tho I thought this game was gonna be trash I still was excited for it XD.

Now I was so late on picking up this game because of some ownership drama I had with my other account so I bought this game in mid 2023, and when I played it it most definitely stood up to my expectations.

Now the reason I'm calling this game strange is mostly because of the gameplay, the gameplay wasn't as fast paced as other Sonic games but rather more action packed, It was still fun as it makes it more like METAL GEAR RISING: REVENGEANCE.

And the story is good in my opinion, the story is not a masterpiece but I think the story itself is worth buying the game. The final horizen story (MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD) .

If you're thinking about buying this game I would definitely recommend it, I mean it's not perfect sure but you can't always wish for perfection and I think that my money and time while playing this game was well spent",,

"Writing this as the UNSKIPPABLE credits roll.

Pros: The music in the game goes so insanely hard

Cons: I don't think sonic team ever learned how to make a 3d game still.

I don't get how the massive disappointment of a port that this is has never been fixed. Lackluster graphics options, and that ~render distance~, you either deal with mod instability, or how gross this game is vanilla, there's no winner here. This game is definitely a step up over their previous 3d titles, but it doesn't fix the sins of their past. HOWEVER, there's enough redeeming fun qualities to overcome the frustrations I experienced during my 100%",,
"This game is fun until you get to the mini-game portions. the game becomes downright dumb with the mechanics and is virtually unplayable at some points.

The game will often cheese you out of a victory in some of these actions by having mechanics not work right, and by not properly explaining absolutely anything. While some games leave you to figure things out, they make it so it's at least discoverable. Some of the things in this game you will only find by accident, and are seemingly unconnected to the portion they're supposed to be tied to.

I simply, cannot, in good conscious, recommend this game to anyone.

The game takes a few hours to get to those parts, so by the time you figure out if you're willing to put up with any of it, you're unable to get a refund, either.",,

"The rest of the game is extremely solid, but the manditory boss rush towards the end of DLC 4 is practically impossible. You need to use the game's flawed parry system to beat the 3 super sonic bosses (which are more of spectacle fights than anything) with only 400 rings shared between all of them, with your base stats. Not even changing the difficulty to easy helped this. I was able to beat the entire base game on hard (the intended difficulty for the default true end) and couldn't manage DLC 4.

"Pro tip: Set ""Deceleration Rate"" and ""Jump Deceleration"" to 0 and then set ""Maintain boost during jump"" to ""On"" and the game becomes twice as fun as you can gain some insane traversal speed and air time. God bless Sonic Team for adding these settings in the most recent patch.",,
"This game is quite a mixed bag, saying its not something I've ever seen before.
The gameplay (especially at the second island) can sometimes feel like a token collection simulator, but once I got to the third island it completely stopped, and the only time I ever had to get memory tokens ever again was at the very end of the game. I think the open world should have been improved, (as in it feels like one huge level with an objective, and not an open world like Elden Ring or Breath of the Wild) but other than that this game is quite fun. The story feels a bit broken up until the third island, but again after the third island it gets really good. Keep in mind, this was my first (actual) sonic game that wasn't a rom hack so my opinion of how the game is like compared to other sonic titles may be a bit tainted. The music in this game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ masterpiece, GOD I love the music. Rock is my favorite genera, and I feel like its explored a lot in the major bosses in the game, which I really like. Overall, this is an 8/10 game. Pick it up when its on sale though, its not worth $60. (It's quite short for a AAA title, it took me 18 hours to beat)
Gameplay: 6.5/10
Story: 8.5/10
Music: 9.5/10",,
"Coming from a fan of Sonic over the Generations, through each of his Adventures, and spanning across his entire spectrum of Colors... Frontiers has Unleashed the new direction for Sonic & Knuckles to go in. This is now my new favorite 3D Sonic game and I had to replay my entire collection of Sonic games to come to terms with that.

I completed the game initially with momentum physics mods but, upon replay, I think the game is best unmodded. Exploring the islands with Sonic feels great like swinging around in Manhattan as SpiderMan feels great. Especially with the ability to listen to music tracks from the series while you do it! You can customize Sonic's top-speed, acceleration, turn speed, boost speed, and more in the Options which allows you to tailor the way Sonic handles to fit your skill level (turn it all to max babyyy). The open world aspect of the game is done well as a collectathon with challenges gating each collectible (a challenge is just normal Sonic gameplay triggered by a spring, rail, boost panel, etc). Challenges chain into each other and lead you all around the island(s) while feeling like one giant Sonic level. The first three islands are fantastic although the last two feel like the team ran out of time and could have used more visual variety and care. Here's hoping the next game in this format gets more time in the oven!

Something the game does extraordinarily well is how easy it is to be Sonic and to not fall to your death over-and-over again. This is a gripe that many have with Sonic games in the past and my favorites are guilty of this problem as well. The best Sonic games are traditionally unforgiving platformers that are difficult to master and require you to practice to look/feel good. I didn't realize this was an issue until I went back and replayed my favorites. This one, however, is much more accessible. The game slows you down when you jump, slows you down when you enter a 2D segment, and the camera highlights the obstacles you need to overcome in time which allows you to react with fine movement control. In the older games, you often just have to memorize what comes next to succeed but you don't have to do that in this game thanks to these guard rails. What if you still make a mistake? No worries, falling is just a ""woopsie, guess I'll go this way instead"" moment unless you absolutely need to get somewhere specific for the story. I personally found myself doing most challenges and gameplay segments flawlessly on my first attempt since I know the Sonic formula; no memorization required.

Another thing this game does very well is that it will gate certain areas, like a higher elevation or distant land, or chaos emeralds behind gameplay challenges. This means you have to chain bouncing off springs, grind rails, running up walls, and hitting boost panels at high speed to access these areas. The game features 3D gameplay primarily that sometimes segues into 2D like Sonic Generations; this transition feels natural and the boost gameplay is at it's best here too. These challenges vary in length, some are just quick 5-30 second segments and others may take 1-5 minutes like an actual Sonic level. My favorite challenges are the latter but the bite sized gameplay segments are sprinkled all throughout each island so you are always within arms reach of something that will send you flying in the air. Speaking of which, try a boost jump off a rail that has an upward incline to fly whenever. There are a lot of interesting little gameplay quirks to discover to continue momentum.

The game also features combat and RPG elements in the form of stats. I recommend playing on hard difficulty and not leveling up your stats at all because the gameplay is pretty easy (Sonic is meant for kids after all). The combat is kind of like a simplistic character action game with more style than substance; very easy but it looks cinematic and feels good. If you are expecting complexity like Devil May Cry here then you are silly because this is just a Sonic game. This is more like Easy Automatic mode in Devil May Cry with spammable special moves that can stun lock bosses if you know how. Speaking of which, the boss battles are some of the best in all of Sonic history and the music for these scenes caught me off guard but I ended up loving it. Quality dips off toward the last quarter of the game in this regard however and there is planned DLC to fix this.

Best story in a Sonic game since the Adventure series. I was resistant to the story at first (and to the game as a whole to be honest) but it grew on me once I gave it a chance. I actually got emotional at the end of the game and I wasn't expecting that. The music also is really good here despite Jun Senoue not composing any of the pieces.

Let's talk about something called CyberSpace for a second. This game has some classic Sonic levels inside it, 30 to be exact. These levels are scattered across each island and award you a necessary collectible for progression. 23 of these levels are literal 1 to 1 remakes of other levels from the different 3D Sonic games except with generic Green Hill or Chemical Plant zone backgrounds/textures. So most of these levels should be familiar if you're a fan of the series. It is a good thing to revisit some older games' level design with modern controls but I wish they used the actual art assets from the games they were borrowing from. It is also a bummer that these levels are separate from the open world. I would personally cut the CyberSpace levels in the next game and instead integrate them seamlessly into the open world. The CyberSpace basically feels like jumping into a painting in Super Mario 64 except Mario moves a little bit differently and most of the levels are remastered editions of levels you played in a previous game; they also only last a minute or two each. These levels provide the classic Sonic arcade rush experience and were a change of pace but I wish Sonic controlled the same as in the open world in these levels.

I like this game. I had fun. This was the most fun I have had with Sonic in a long time and it gives me hope for the future of the series. This was a solid first attempt but I do think that Sega can do even better next time. I hope the developers will choose to make the game truly open world as opposed to using separate maps and will add more variety to each area's design. I also hope they will add more area types to explore (underwater, running on water, highway, snow, board areas, etc). I would also like to see the length of a CyberSpace level baked into the open world environment. It would be really exciting to, for example, hit a spring panel which launches you into the air where you are then picked up by a helicopter and now you are beginning a Speed Highway level segment which connects you to another area (or you rip off a piece of the helicopter to use as a board for a City Escape segment etc). Going back would be an alternate or parallel version of the level. One can always dream.",,

"Absolutely not a perfect game, but it is still a good game. I'm going to paraphrase others and say that this is a step in the right direction for Sonic, mostly because I agree with it. While it's not 100% polished, it's a very enjoyable open world game. The game utilizes this open worldliness to hide lots of collectibles incentivizing upgrades to Sonic's stats. Unlike the limited options of previous titles, Sonic Frontiers adds many new combat mechanics that make you feel like you're actually playing as a fast and powerful little hedgehog- seamlessly blasting through all the robots with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ epic interactive fight scenes. I personally love this side of Sonic, the game brings back the edginess to Sonic- with the kick-ass heavy metal soundtrack being the defining ""edgy"" part of the series that has always been the best part of all the Sonic games. Scenes with other characters are more heart-felt and sentimental, i.e. Knuckles actually acting like Sonic's rival rather than just another empty husk made for the sole purpose of providing nothing to the story and talk at you (Sonic Forces..). The characters and story feel so alive, from the facial features to the dialogue, it all carries the emotion that I would've expected to see from characters that have known each other for three decades.

There are some parts that feel partially unfinished, but the consistent introduction of new mechanics as you go along makes up for it. Overall, I do recommend this game to anyone looking to try out Sonic for the first time or for returning veterans that are willing to try something new. 8/10. I think it's safe to say that Sonic is back on track! With two really well done animated family movies and a new TV show, Sonic Frontiers is the cherry on top!

"This is the best Sonic game since SA2, either this is good news or bad news. Because the games that came after Adventure were mediocre at best.

In stark contrast with literally all Sonic games since Unleashed, that were just two mediocre games slapped together to make up for the deficiencies the boost formula - this is a single game. There is no werehog who makes up most of this game, there is no classic sonic who makes up half of this title and is conveniently forgotten by fans and there are no wisps.

There's only Sonic, the openzone and the gameplay loop within it. Sonic explores the openzone, does various small activities within it, which reward him upgrades to strength, defence, speed and health. There is combat and its the best combat Sonic has ever seen and adds another level of gamplay, hitherto unseen since the Adventure days. There are boss fights and they are the best fights Sonic has ever had, which isn't including the titans as well.

Sonic himself controls extremely well, the best since Adventure. Overall, if you like boost you'll probably dislike this game because it's nothing like boost sonic. I don't like boost and I think this is several steps in the right direction, said direction is actually being a game.",,
"The 70~75 range this has on Metacritic is accurate. The game has a bunch of glitches, boring combat, uninspired instance levels, the non-boss music doesn't rank well with the series, and the writing is awful. But regardless, I think this is the best 3D sonic game to date. The open world contains hundreds of tiny levels within it and is fun to explore, the game almost always lets you go fast, and it surgically targets core gamers and fans.

If Sega got their ♥♥♥♥ together, I'd look forward to Frontiers 2, but I have no faith in Sega's ability to deliver despite their success with this one. None of the good Sonic games in the past decade have marked a turning point for the franchise.",,

"Well, that was an entertaining adventure!

Looks like the famous hedgehog finally found the right formula for his persona!
Gameplay design has a lot of questionable things, It feels like the game did not have an appropriate post-production stage where the rough edges should have been smoothed or removed such as 2D sections in the open zone after passing which you try to bypass any acceleration paths and trampolines just to not get into this 2D trap or the moments when game taking control away from the player and try to be cinematic with pointless cutscenes on the way to the boss(it doesn't happen often in the whole game, but looks weird, because it doesn't play any role in the narrative).

The game will hint 'till the end at how much it lacked for monetary investment, but what's evident in the game is a lot of LOVE - developers understood well what kind of space the hedgehog needs to unlock his potential and it's clear from the characters dialogues that the scriptwriter also respects the historical legacy of the franchise, such attention warmed my heart.

I hope public attention that was given to the blue hedgehog this year is strong enough signal for SEGA to turn their financial attention back to the former face of the company and give to Sonic Team some *serious money* for sequel where the basis of this game will be deepened and maybe even gave us a worthy candidate who will take the award not only for the best audio design but also the GOTY.

I love it. Its a great step towards a renaissance of my favorite childhood character.",,
"I will keep this as short as I can. As a longstanding Sonic fan that has held off on most recent releases, Sonic Frontiers is the largest breath of fresh air.

The gameplay is what you would expect out of a Sonic game - fast paced and clunky at times. The amount of different skills you learn through collecting skill points brings a lot of diversity to how combat looks and feels, which makes it so that it never feels tiring fighting foes. Difficulty places greater importance on your Power and Defense stats, but doesn't make things impossible if playing on Hard - difficulty is very well balanced.

The environments are vibrant and large (outside of the first island), and are great to explore. Some of the areas that swap between 2D and 3D movement can be a little finnicky, and you will often times find yourself trying to reach your destination to get halted, which can be frustrating at times in all honesty - but when engaging in them intentionally, they work fantastic and introduce a nice change of pace to the game's open world movement.

Collectables are an abundance in this game, but you need not stress collecting everything to proceed if you aren't a completionist. You will not be halted in the story if you decide not to collect all memories/tokens in a zone, but they are a nice clean-up addition for those of us who are completionists.

In an effort to keep this short I will say that the story is phenomenal, and the Portal zones and fishing are great breaks from the open world combat. Some of them are more challenging than others to complete all challenges (looking at you 1-2), but for the most part an average player won't have an issue, and will have a great time.

Last but not least, the soundtrack and audio in this game. A coworker told me to listen to a song on Sonic Frontier's soundtrack, and hearing Kellin Quinn's voice made me rush home and immediately purchase the game. Open world audio and zone music feels proper, and sounds absolutely phenomenal. You can listen to the soundtrack to this game and find a song for any mood. Each lyric relates to what is going on in the game at the time, and they bring a ton of emotion into the playthrough.

I cannot recommend this game enough. My actual in-game playtime on my save is 32 hours and change - and that was to collect every single thing there was to collect and 100%ing every zone including each of the four fishing zones, and obtaining every achievement. Was this game worth the full price tag? I would say yes if you've been a Sonic fan and are wary. But this is a must own game for any old-school platforming lover that loves to collect and move.",,
"after years of mediocre games in this series, it feels really nice to have a new game come out and it actually be great

music is on point, visuals are beautiful, story is gripping, characters are great both visually and voice acting

and most importantly, the islands are fun to explore and the levels are fun to run through

easily an 8 or even a 9/10 for me",,
"I was really worried about this game being another disappointment in the Sonic series, but I'm really happy that it turned out really good! Sonic Frontiers has a lot of things I really wanted out of 3D Sonic game and they're executed pretty well.

Zooming around big areas, the fight system is super cool, enemy designs are quite clever and utillize a number of the game mechanics and fighting the Titans feels really epic. This is paired with more serious writing compared to previous Sonic games.

The game still has its flaws and some things I didn't care for much - generally the cyberspace levels and controls in 2D sections feeling very heavy and slow and some of the quests being a bit weird, but overall this is a great and enjoyable Sonic game with a lot of cool new mechanics and content.",,
"Completed the game 100%. It took about 20 in game hours.

The game is so much fun. There is so much flair and character in this game that it really made me feel like a kid again. The sound track is amazing. The boss fights, while they may be goldfield cutscenes, are amazing. The ending of the game falls off for me and the game length should be longer for a $60 game. This is definitely not perfect but it has me excited for what sonic team can come up with next.

- the pop-in is not nearly enough to ruin your experience, but its just enough to annoy you

"Frontiers feels fast, dynamic and frankly fantastic to play, with great lines of springs, ramps, loops and obstacles, fun combat, occasionally challenging mini-bosses, epic boss fights and worlds that invite the player to explore them.

The open zones have a ""checklist map"" nature to them, but the game is forgiving with its currencies and not only does not require the player to gather every single thing, but it also provides multiple sources for them, including a fishing minigame that features Big the Cat. As fun as they are to traverse in search for activities, the islands themselves lack personality and suffer from dull visuals, while also appearing a little empty and disjointed.

The action stages, although rich in number, are rather short, but intense. Frankly, the difficulty for clearing their extra objectives is mostly easy, but the times for S ranks can be a bit inconsistent, with a few that are particularly difficult compared to the rest. They're much more interesting than the overworld in terms of visuals and style, but for some reason they only come in 4 themes based on stages from past titles that feel a little overdone by now.

Like most modern videogames, Frontiers also features an RPG-like system that allows Sonic to gain new moves and improve his stats. The moveset can feel a bit unnecessarily bloated at one point, although fun to play around with, but improving the stats too much sort of messes up the game's balance.

From a technical standpoint, the game lacks high-end graphical options and could benefit from higher draw distance, which can become a real issue when looking for the start of a line that leads to a token that is too far up. In traditional 3D Sonic fashion, the camera can prove a little difficult as well, locking both itself and Sonic into a specific position when certain platforming objects are interacted with.

Every pro seems to have its con and yet, the overall experience was very positive to me. Despite its faults, Frontiers is a lot of fun to play and tells an enjoyable, light-hearted story that shows awareness of the events of past titles and expands the lore in a way that might pay off in the near future. In short, this may be one of the strongest titles in the franchise, even with the almost experimental feeling it evokes.

On a personal note, I wish Sonic Team could focus on their successes and what makes Sonic, the gang and their universe truly great and unique without feeling like recurring to nostalgic stages is a must. Regardless, I have high expectations for what's to come and would like to congratulate the team on their hard work.",,
"I loved the whole game, they did amazing. HOWEVER. The way they were building up to the final fight with all these bosses, the final boss severely disappointed me with Touhou.

edit, found out the final boss was like that due to dev and budget restraints. Now im not ""severely"" disappointed about it.",,
"I can finally be happy as a sonic fan once more. I love this game, flaws and all.",,

"This game is not perfect. The movement of your character and his momentum in the hyperspace stages feels jank at times. Sometimes the game forces you into the 2D style in the over world in really unintuitive ways that feel like they take away all your control and freedom. But I still did have a lot of fun playing this game, as short as it is. Kinda a treat for people nostalgic for the older sonic games with its more somber tone. Nothing wrong with the goofier new stuff, lots of people prefer that. But if you played the games in the 2000's you know what I mean. This is a formula that can be improved on greatly and this game feels like the tech demo for things to come. Its short, sweet, and makes you feel like a kid again to play it. Its also a little jank, and has a terrible pinball minigame that is required to progress. Classic 3D sonic game right there. Overall pretty fun game and I hope the series improves on this formula.",,
"EDIT: Finished the game 100% in about 37 hours total. Updating review

I kind of wish the options on Steam weren't just ""👍"" or ""👎"" because it's really neither. The game itself is fun but I think $60 is a bit steep for what it is. I enjoyed the game, though, so I feel it needs to be recommended--but take it with a grain of salt.

SEGA made a decent Sonic game. Perfect? No. But this is an exciting look at what the Sonic team will be doing in the future. It's a little buggy, sure, and some of the mechanics are a bit of a leap, but I played this for hours without getting bored. This was the best Sonic game I've played since SA2. I hope the DLC updates SEGA says they'll be pushing aren't just new skins and collabs, etc. because, as it is now, it's a fun open-world arcade game that could be so much more.

Pros:
* Killer soundtrack
* Beautiful open world
* A surprisingly deep story for a Sonic game
* Fun gameplay
* Pays homage to Sonic's roots with fun classic-ish levels
* Sonic game made me cry????

Cons:
* Can get repetitive
* Buggy
* Graphics can't keep up with Sonic -- a LOT of pop-in
* Overworld dialogue is kinda meh; should be fully voiced, we know you have the money SEGA.
* No post game besides arcade mode, which is just replaying the portal levels

All of this notwithstanding, SEGA: BRING BACK CHAO WORLD",,
This is going in the right direction. Great game. :D,,
The sequel will be the best Sonic game to date. I have faith in this one.,,
"TLDR; As a life-long sonic fan I give this 1 Thumb up, If open world is your thing and Sonic, this is the best Sonic game since 06'! Especially Sonic '06.

This game feels tooo open and too empty, but that leaves lots of room for zoomin' and a love letter to sonic mashed together. it feels a little out of place , and weird through all of my play time so far. Though the mechanics of controlling, racing, and zooming as Sonic are so tight it makes up for the weird atmospherre of the game as im usually too focused on AIR STYLIN!",,
"After tumbling down a hill, Sonic finally recovers itself and takes a step forward.

Frontiers throws Sonic in an open ""zone"" environment, with fairly expansive islands to explore and run around. In a new collect-a-thon style for the series, there's several collectibles around the map that are needed to be picked up to progress through the story, and they can be found in the form of small platforming challenges or short stages called Cyberspace. To take a break in between these are sidestories, small snips of (finally much needed) dialog between characters, and combat.

Exploration is good for me, I've always enjoyed walking around a big map and collecting things, doing the dreaded ""Ubisoft towers"" to reveal more of the map, using the character abilities to help with discovery. Normally for other games of the same genre I've needed a third party website or app to be able to get all collectibles, but for Frontiers everything was in the game, so that's a good thing in my book.
Movement and controls were good for me, Sonic felt good to control and I felt like I wasn't just being flung in a direction hoping I hit the correct angle. There were a few times where I kinda flew off in another direction but at the same time I couldn't really tell if it was my fault or if the game was a bit jank. I know several people who are put off by the boost style of movement but I also never played Sonic Adventure as a kid, so I'm unfazed by the kinks this system has.
Combat is fairly simple, with a parry system and combos that can be executed with a combination of buttons that some enemies will need to be defeated more easily. The new Cyloop ability also gets its use, although it feels it's more of a crowd control than means to do damage. These abilities are unlocked by progressing through the game, so it's a good way to slowly introduce these moves and experimenting with them.
Oh my god they put Metal Gear Rising boss battles in this game. Every single one actually put a smile on my face over how cool they were. I can't really say much other than they are very cool.
Story definitely takes a background role in newer Sonic games, but it was definitely a step up from previous entries. Going from Sonic ""being tortured for months"" to Eggman being the plot twist every single time, it's a breath of fresh air, allowing itself to reference past games and stories and expanding on them to build a grander narrative. Voice direction also gave the game a more serious tone, and not in a Forces way where everything was edgy, but more like being a dire situation. Sage also cute.

Going to the negatives, which I at least feel are fairly minor:
- Cyberspace feels underworked, I found the stages fun to experience but having the same 4 reused tilesets for the entire game gets tiring after the second island. It is technically explained later in the story why this is the way it is, but I'm not sure if it's an intended plot point or just an excuse. At the very least that's just visual; in terms of difficulty, the first 2 stages are the hardest in the game, with the rest having wildly varying levels of difficulty going from ""completing all missions in one go"" to ""I just cant seem to get past this one part"". Rearranging the stages or changing their S-rank times/rings would help them. Thankfully Cyberspace is just a very small part of the game (I would say about 1-2 hours in the +35 it took me to 100% the game) which simply serves as a way to add some diversity to the gameplay loop.
- The parry system is *way* too forgiving, you are frozen in place and are safe from almost all damage for 15 seconds. If there was an incentive to time the parry for more damage or just a shorter parry window I feel I would have used this feature more than when I was required to, to not feel too cheap about beating enemies. Very late in the game the ability gets a bit more sensible to use, but the feeling of ""as long as I hold two buttons I'm safe"" doesn't really go away.
- Please Sega what are these graphics options... Graphics: ""High"" or ""Low"" is something for a mobile game, not for a full 3D PC game release.
- Oh my god what do you MEAN i need to upgrade 99 levels of speed and ring capacity , with like 10 seconds of delay between each level.

I enjoyed my time with Frontiers, even if there was a bit of jank I found in there the great majority was spent having fun with a speedy movement system through expansive lands, collecting items and seeing number go up release happy chemicals. I would definitely recommend it to Sonic fans, and the people that have been interested in a Sonic game but are ""scared of it not being good"", I've seen people that have never touched a Sonic game saying this was their favourite game of the year. Definitely a must play, especially in these times of uncertainty for the Sonic franchise. alsosegastoprushinggamestosellonholidayseason.",,
"I'd give it a sidways thumb if I could, the game clearly has a lot of heart in it, which has been lacking from this series for quite a while. I enjoyed that aspect of it, and unlike most I actually largely enjoyed the movement systems within the game. I much prefer having control of my character verses momentum based systems that send me flying off cliffs 99 times out of 100, sure yes I've gone sailing off ledges in this game too but I've actually saved myself a good number of those times as well thanks to the boosting in air ability, so I much prefer that over most other forms of locamotion the blue blur has had. (only main thing that bothered me was the internal cooldown placed on boosting and the fact you couldn't do it infinitely in air, that just felt very not enjoyable the times I'd run into it).

Other than that, the 'pop in' everyones been raving about didn't effect me to much, I'd notice it sure but it never halted progression or anything. The many rails through out the world weren't to bad either. Sometimes you'd want to use them, sometimes you'd sprint past them, that's rather fine to me. The story was honestly really fantastic though, you could see the direction it was going rather early but the fact it pushed all the way through with it was reallly cool. A bit hand wavy toward the end but ehh, actually enjoying a sonic games story is something that hasn't happened for...a while, so I say big thumbs up their and I hope they only continue with this direction going forward. (random aside I forgot to say but the instant drop feature is just fantastic here too, and for whatever reason I've heard some complain about the ability to like, turn as sonic, whenever you want, and to me that's just dumb, I love being able to shift my direction on the fly, makes Sonic feel like he actually has control of himself at high speeds instead of just 'can go fast'.)

Now, to get to the reason I'd want to give it a side finger instead of a full thumbs up, would be the various worlds and level lay outs. Yes, you are once again going into all of sonic's old classics, with no innovation in level themeing. Level DESIGN is rather new and fun, but the themes are all tired at this point, and really didn't need to be brought back even if you hand wave it away as 'sonic putting his experiences on top of the cyber space layouts'. Would have much prefered the levels be themed after the REALly nice looking worlds they sit in, but shrug at this point.

Outside of that, World One and World Two where really enjoyable, with world two starting to taper off with some of the enemy designs. World three utttterly blowed though, the only thing that was nice was the Spider enemy design being really fun once one figures out they can homing attack then quick cy loop the legs to get into free fall super fast. But outside of that, the world itself felt rushed as all hell, and felt like it probably should have been skipped. SO many 'lock you to 2 d and don't let you leave' sections that you get forced into at random and it just feels so terrible every single time, that and I swear every single level in that place was just 'what is the most annoying thing we can possibly put into a level?' and then they just made that the theme and it SUCKKKEd. The entire world was terrible, only slightly made alright by tails having a...whatever life crisis about his lack of characterization the last couple games and making it seem like the whole place was entirely meant to be terrible. But just, yeah, that was bleh, (boss design for 1 and 2 was rather fun, 3 was alright to btw). 'World four' served it's function, liked to story, then World five thankfully is a 'return to form' with a much more entertaining sandbox that lets you free roam again, and a bunch of levels that where all enjoyable (to me at least) once more. So 3/4(5) is pretty good, but dam if world 3 in its entirety (with world 2's story driven 'mini games' not being like, good at all either) really just makes it hard to recommend. That combined with the 'final final' boss being a extremely punishing bullet hell instead of you know, an actual boss fight that makes sense in a sonic game/even within it's own game just, bleh. Still felt the ending story wise was good, but it just...yeah.

If it isn't evident, the game's a roller coaster. A solid 7/10 for certain, with very high high points and very low low points. I'd give it a play if you've been waiting for a sonic game for years, otherwise, I'd wait to see if they are allowed to 'iterate' and improve on this, here's hoping they are...",,
"the controls take some getting used to but this is definetly one of the most fun experiences ive ever had, after enjoying elden ring i was excited to hear that Sonic was going to be in an open world running at his insane speeds. even when on low graphics the game still looks phenomenal and runs well. i think that the game is overhated and needs some more recognition.",,

"I am so glad we have a new Sonic game that plays similar to the Sonic Adventure series. The open worlds are massive and there's tons to explore. My only gripe is with the levels themselves. Most of them play like the levels from Sonic games of recent years, and not like the ones from Sonic Adventure. There are a couple that are more platformer, but most of them are not. However, they are still fun to play. I just wish they had more platformer levels.

The graphics are also really great. I'm amazed they got this level of detail in the Unity Engine.",,
"One of the best Sonic games to date. Certainly not perfect, though, but a great foundation for future titles. The game is fairly simplistic, but will pull you in with that need to explore and collect items. Combat is also very enjoyable, though you can mostly get through the game without utilizing it fully. You only have 1 attack button, but can string combos together with various abilities like dashing and dodging. After playing a large amount of the game, going for 100% completion, I am disappointed to note the lack of challenge. Only stage 1-2 presented a challenge when going for S Rank. You had to be nearly flawless, which actually made things really fun. Sadly, no other stage presented this strict challenge afterwards. Another downside is that there are barely any skills to learn, so if you plan on enjoying the game to the fullest, you will quickly max out everything. Finally, increasing stats couldn't be a bigger pain. While Strength and Defense is increased all at once when turning in Koco's, speed and rings go up 1 at a time. So, you have to go through dialogue and watch an animation a total of 200 times to max out those stats.

Overall, this game is definitely worth it for any 3D sonic fan, but the gameplay feels more like a test run to see what sticks. The combat alone makes me excited for the future of sonic games. We just need to push this open zone/world concept a bit further. Make it feel more lively and maybe move away from a realistic overworld.",,
"The closest thing we'll likely ever get to Sonic Adventure 3 and I'm fine with that. There's moments I felt some of that same magic I did playing SA1 for the first time on my Sister's Dreamcast

This entire game feels like a love letter to the PS2 and Gamecube days of platformers. Everything from the top notch visual style and gorgeous worlds to the exploration and semi-open-world game-play style. An open world style that works perfectly to create a breather between the action stages and make the game feel more like an experience and less like a linear theme park ride.

The controls are also pretty dead-on once you get them dialed in the way you like and I had a blast S-ranking every stage I could. My only point of complaint is that the 2D stages can be frustrating at times because the locked side-view camera can prevent you from seeing very far ahead.

Everything about the presentation is also mind-blowing because of their decision to bring Ian Flynn in as the head script writer and advisor. This really feels like a point of convergence where the writing for the games catches up to the writing in the EU media like the IDW comics. This is one of the best depictions of the cast and their dynamics with each other I've seen game-side, especially the display of Sonic and Tails bond during the section of the game where you're heavily interacting with him.

It really feels like his intent was a story-line where all the characters get a chance to grow and have personal realizations so Frontiers mark the beginning of a new era for the franchise going forward.

I cannot express enough how wonderful of an experience this game is and how much I encourage anyone interested to support Sonic Team by buying it so we can see Frontiers become the new template and bar of quality for modern Sonic titles.",,

To put it bluntly, this game is good. Its not perfect but DAMN is it a good experience. Originally I was gonna talk about the pros and cons for the game. Instead I'll give a few tips for anyone thinking of picking the game up. A few settings are better than others but at the same time its tailored for any individual player.

-Sonic is fully customization before the start of the game. You can do so in the options and adjust sonic's feel to your interest.
-Play in High-speed mode. Action mode if you're new to sonic games and aren't used to the speed you can move at, but otherwise play at high speed. You wont regret this option.
-Explore the Island. You'll be amazed by what you'll be able to find.
-If you have fishing coins, go fish. Take a break and relax. You'll thank me later.
-Titans are bosses. Dont worry about doing everything before fighting them, minus the final titan
-Do cyloops in open space for free rings. Do an infinity symbol for infinite boost. Handy if you're at max rings.
-You do not need to complete every challenge in cyber space to finish the game. Game is super generous with materials needed to complete it.
-Finisher attacks are individual button presses, not holds unless specified otherwise. Looking at you wild rush.
-You can get the Sonic Adventure 2 Soap shoes by signing up for the sonic frontiers newsletter.

Game is fantastic and cannot recommend this game enough. The most fun I have had playing a Sonic game since Sonic Unleashed. Not to also mention the modding community is already working on the game to enhance the experience even more. Worth playing a second time through with mods to change up the experience a bit.

Have fun, and remember. Gotta Go Fast.",,
"Sonic is back baby, you gotta get this game fast.",,
"I don't think I need to say much, it's an actual good sonic game with good reviews.

Also OST is KILLER.",,
Playing this brought me back to a time in life where everything was new and exciting. It was Christmas Time and we had just gotten a Gamecube second hand. One of the only games we had at the time was Sonic Adventure 2. I played it for so long. Playing this put me back to a time when I was happier.,,
A lot of people complain about this game but tbh I like it. It's not your typical run-of-the-mill sonic game. It tries to be different and I can appreciate that. The combat is your repetitive kinda of fun type of game-play and it doesn't have to be anything more than that. I hope that any upcoming games will take this one as a learning experience and that it will be a stepping stone into making more innovative Sonic games.,,
"the story and lore were honestly really interesting to me & it was by far the easiest sonic game for me to get into . the ending felt a little anti-climactic the first time i played it through, since i didn't do that first attempt on hard mode, but the final boss was super cool & my only issue with it was that it didnt have any subtitles whatsoever for what it was saying. also, i loved the characterization and the development that everyone got :]",,
"A definite improvement in terms how Sonic plays and how the writing for the characters and larger story compared to Forces from 5 years ago. This game isn't perfect by any means it's still a SEGA/Sonic Team game, expect jank here and there, but overall this game is the most enjoyable Sonic game in awhile.

Ultimately Sonic fans that have played previous games will see the improvements and future potential, however it remains to be seen if Sonic Team has finally stopped tripping over their shoelaces or if they will again learn the wrong lessons of what people enjoyed from this game and make another Forces tier rendering Frontiers good as an accidental fluke. The game is fun if a little odd with new things like combat they are trying out.

It's a 7-7.5/10 game realistically, but as a Sonic fan it's a nice refreshing 9/10 from me.",,

UPDATE - 12/05/22

Updating this review now that I've finished the game, and I think there are a lot of points to be talked about. This game isn't my favorite Sonic game, but it is certainly a step in the right direction.

First off, the open world. Very cool in theory, and it is super cool to just experience Sonic doing what he does best: Running. A welcome change, and traversing the open world and its obstacles are super fun, but unfortunately the wonder wears off. I found myself not caring about exploring everything after the first island, and a lot of the obstacles just feel disjointed from the world.

Boss fights are a much welcome change from the usual on-rails style most Sonic games are known for. This game's combat, albeit simple, is still a much more complex way of handling these fights, and don't even get me started on the true ending's final boss. All the music is fantastic and I think this is a great framework moving forward.

The gameplay loop is easily the most daunting part for me, as it seems it was for many others. It goes like this: Drop on island, complete (well designed, mind you) cyberspace levels to get keys to get a chaos emerald. Not bad. The bad part comes on the other half of that where you need to grind for (MANY) character tokens in order to unlock lore and progress the story more, and sometimes needing to complete a (very annoying) minigame which will give you your other chaos emeralds. This wasn't really a problem at first, but each island plays exactly like this and it gets very exhausting after a while.

All in all, I think this game has great bones for Sonic games moving forward, and I think I can easily give this game a solid 7.5/10, but Generations still reigns supreme.",,
"I was a kid that begged my mom for a Genesis when I saw the commercials for Sonic the Hedgehog. I had the first two hundred or so Archie Comics. Sonic pretty much was my childhood. I parted ways with the blue blur for many years. I picked up Sonic Adventure late, didn't even finish it at the time. I would check in from time to time, but I thought it was just a franchise I left in childhood. Mania came around and convinced me to give Sonic a fair shake. Forces was a little flat, but not offensive. I was never really part of the OC fanfic community, so I just assumed I was outside the target demographic for the game. I spent most of the year revisiting old Sonic games that I missed, and finding most of them weren't particularly good. All of that is to say, I have a soft spot for Sonic, but I can't consider myself a fanboy anymore.

Frontiers delivers on a lot of what I imagined Sonic to be as a kid: a trail of blue light that traces impossible paths across a landscape, up the side of cliffs, jumping incredible distances, quickly dispatching enemies with speed as his weapon. The camera, lock on targeting, and environment design mostly stay out of the way of that feeling, and in my opinion that is 90% of what has held the franchise back in the 3D era.

The ""open zone"" is the majority of this game. It is not unfair to call it's objectives a ""collectathon."" The majority of the collectibles are ""memory tokens"" used to progress both the main and side stories. Most of these tokens are locked behind little platforming puzzles. My approach to them was to find the token and walk through the challenge backwards until I found the starting point. Getting to the correct starting point is the hardest part most of the time.

There are also discrete zones. For the most part they play like mostly-polished modern Sonic zones. Their art direction, enemies, and traps are inspired by previous games. I spotted Sky Sanctuary, Chemical Plant, Speed Highway, Neo/Green Hill. With the number of these zones in the game, it would have been nice to see more classic zones referenced. Perhaps there is room for that in DLC, or sequel to this game. There were two zones, later in the game, that seemed less fun than the rest, but overall I had a great time completing the four challenges per level. I would like to see harder challenges that could be used to unlock concept art, developer commentary, or something similar.

This may seem like faint praise, but the story in this game was actually coherent with one play through. That is notable for this franchise, as it frequently fails at that goal. Taken on it's own, I think the story was pretty good. I enjoyed Eggman getting a bit more fleshed out (which mostly happens via optional unlockables from the fishing mini-game) and the new character, Sage, had a compelling arc. There were various callbacks and references to previous games and and cartoons that I enjoyed as someone who has recently drudged through a lot of that media. It is important to stress, these are ""Anime Stakes."" We're not talking about Last of Us or anything. We're talking Dragon Ball Z, almost Full Metal Alchemist.

The graphics are what they are. The pop in is pretty bad on low graphics settings (Steam Deck), but it's manageable on high graphic settings (a gaming laptop from two years ago). Textures are frequently flat or muddy, but I was generally going too fast to care.

Overall, I really liked this game. I have a hard time understanding the people who really don't like it. I think a 4/5 is probably fair for the average player, but if you're a long suffering Sonic fan like me, this might be your game of the year.",,
"If you're a Sonic fan, I think you'll enjoy Frontiers. This is some of the most fun I've had with a Sonic game in years, already beating my playtime in Generations. It's got some issues, pop in can be annoying, especially on Ares Island but I think the game's highest highs make up for everything. The soundtrack is great, the references are fun and while the terrain may not make sense when looking at it, going from rail to rail, boosting in mid air to get where you wanna go if you have the accuracy is such a great shot of serotonin. That aspect does remind me of trying to do tricky rail jumps in the Adventure games and while it's not always successful it's fun.
Objectively I would say it's a 7/10 but to me personally it's at least an 8!",,
"Hands down the best 3D Sonic game. The characters, music, lore, cut scenes etc were all on point. The cyber space levels however are easily the worst part, they control terrible but luckily some of the best music in the game are in them. I recommend this to anyone interested in getting into sonic or is a long time veteran. There's references to past games and the personalities of the core cast have finally been fixed. Roger also gives his best performance as Sonic Yet. Hopefully Sega uses this game as a blueprint going forward. I loved every minute and despite 100 percent completing the game after 35 hours I'm still going to get back in just to run around the open worlds. BUY THIS GAME",,
"I would say as a long time Sonic fan that this is truly Sonic Teams first solid game since colors. This game still has that ""sonic jank"" but with just a little practice its a great platformer through and through with a much better story then previous installments have provided. This is no tear jerker but there is solid emotion, links and call backs to certain events, and a new character we may see again. Boss fights are the most epic and grand the series has to offer, but can be gimmicky and have one trick quick time events. However they are very fun to pull off and extreme spectacle ensues when you do. I regret not buying the digital deluxe edition as I did not have faith in Sonic Team and test footage, BUT I WAS WRONG. Any Sonic fans that are on the fence, just try it out and give it a chance.",,
"sonic frontiers despite its name is not about sonic exploring a new frontier, its about a humble super genius learning to love his ai daughter. such a beautiful game",,
Good solid game one of the best for a long time. end game is a little disappointing but apart from that very good game,,
i still dont know what the zap symbol meant,,
we dont talk about the final boss,,
"Alright, so I wanted to wait till I completed the game to leave a review and well... THIS IS THE BEST SONIC GAME TO COME OUT IN OVER A DECADE! It's all done so well. The story is amazing and is far longer than Forces was. Forces took me around 2 hours to complete the first time around. This took 18 WHOLE HOURS (on Hard Mode)! So yeah, it feels like Sonic is finally back. I'm really excited for the future of this game and this franchise. Hopefully they keep Ian Flynn in on the long haul.",,
"Best 3D Sonic title since Unleashed. Fun gameplay loop, you run around like a freak and complete the challenges/puzzles/obstacles you run into. It's simply a fun game. You'll definitely notice pop-in, but if you can get past that, there weren't any other technical issues to be found.",,

Its Sonic. What's not to love???!!!,,

"Best 3D Sonic game since Generations. Absolute blast to play. Did 100% of the content, even optional content with no achievements tied to it, and enjoyed it start to finish. No major issues with performance (but be warned that Denuvo is part of the package) and no major glitches encountered. Physics get a little wonky sometimes (light speed dash is a little weird) but mostly consistent. Play it on Hard difficulty if you want to face the true final boss (or at least just change the difficulty before you fight it, but the game is kind of easy even on Hard).

POST-FINAL UPDATE EDIT: I regret everything. Hard is actually Hard now. Easy is (presumably) also Hard. I went through the entirety of The Final Horizon on Hard and if you wanted a challenge, you've got it now. Sounds like this is the case on all difficulties. The update itself is incredibly bulky. I'd say it will easily double your playtime from the base game, not counting the updates released in between. There's a lot of content here now for the price of entry, but be ready to have your rear end handed to you when you jump into The Final Horizon, especially if you're playing on Hard.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is the most -Sonic- a game in this franchise has felt in over a decade. I feel like the team had to cut corners in a few places but between the writing being gold and the world design leaving open the opportunity to explore and appreciate the landscape alongside our hero, I actually felt something I thought this franchise had left behind for good. Really hoping Ian Flynn continues to come back and enrich this world with character and charm and stakes and *intrigue* again, because this and Omens have reignited my passion for a series I'd long-since dismissed as no longer being for me.

I have my gripes; sift around the internet for five minutes and you'll find plenty of complaints about the Cyberspace controls, or some odd choices concerning pacing and player expectation management, or endgame material, but I think the core game here is more than enough to warrant multiple playthroughs for fun. I sincerely hope other franchises take this as an inspiration to create Open Zone games, since this proves Mario Odyssey isn't a one-off fluke for a new genre. And here's to a sequel where the devs and writer are given an even greater freedom to push what Sonic can be forward!",,
double the pay for the writing team and make all the 3d sonics like this please :),,

Good game, nuff said.",,
I like this one.,,
amazing game 10/10 despite it being new and modern it felt super nostalgic,,
Good game,,
I love sonic <3 get for like 20 bucks tho,,
"What an amazing game. Sonic is finally back with this breath of fresh air. I only wish the cyber spaces were a bit more fleshed out levels instead of mini levels. Can't describe this game in any other way than just pure fun.

8/10",,
"After 13 hours, im about 80% finished with the game and since there aren't any unlockables for getting all levels to max, this is where I stop playing this game.

Sonic Frontiers is in my opinion, the best sonic game the franchise has ever seen.
Yes, even better than Generations (besides the modding) and SA2.

Pro:
-AMAZING Music: the OST is an all allround bop, there wasn't a single OST which I would consider annoying or even basic, besides 1 Cyberspace track, but it was over in about 40 sec. so yeah.
-The graphics: while you can definitely see the console port graphics, the game is all around beautiful.
The islands look beautiful and full of life.
-The gameplay: this is, where I think, the game just outdones every other Sonic game.
The open world approach with the devil may cryish combat is just fun.
In my playthrough I only had 2-3 fights which I would consider ""boring"" since they where reskins of earlier open field bosses (looking at you, ninjas)
-The bosses: the highlight of the game are definitely the bosses.
Besides the banger soundtracks for every titan boss, it is freaking amazing to fight them as super sonic, which makes sense lorewise in this game.

cons:
-The Cyberspace levels: while the soundtrack is good in those, the overall level design of every Cyberspace level is just ""meh"".
They are often really restrictricting and there isn't really any replay value of those after you cleared the 4 missions in every level, which you can sometimes do in your first run.
Also it is kind of a bummer that they only took around 3 tilesets from the entire franchise, making a lot of them look very much alike.
-Leveling: while I don't mind getting the neccesary items for leveling up, it is really annoying having to go to the 2 different NPCs for 2 different stat upgrades.
Not the worst, but enough to list it as an con in my opinion.

Overall I love this game and I am sad that it is over, but the after credit scene is teasing a sequel, which it will definitely get since it is by far the best sonic game in recent years, so SEGA would be a donkey not to build upon this.

P.S. For everyone who also thought that the final boss was kind of a letdown:",,
"It's quite fun but pretty janky on some parts.
+ Open world have some good flow into it. Like a mini sonic level every where. Running past it in sequence is quite enjoyable. Mini boss you encounter in the wild is super fun too.

+ Boss is a big step up from another sonic game. Really fun and the music is hype. The fact that you use combat that use in normal Sonic but in super form is a big plus.

+ Fishing is pretty weird fun in this game. The fish is really detailed for some reason. Mechanic is basic but I do enjoy seeing different stuffs he catch up.

- Even though open world is fun. the view is really jarring with sky rails just get drawn every where like a custom map maker. I wish the running course get integrate to the scene a lot better. The pop up is really bad too. Sometimes thing just show up in front of me. It's super jarring.

- I don't like how sonic feel in Cyber space level. On open world the control and speed is all right but in these level it's really sluggish. Big delay on each enemy homing attack is not fun. Biggest offender for me is the fact that you can only stomp and air dash ""Once"" until you hit the ground. This led to so many death over the bottomless pit. It's make these levels not feel fluid at all because some of level designs they're pull from build with chain stomps and multiple boosts in mind.
It doesn't block the progress in any mean but I don't like it.

In the end. Despite the problems I say I still recommended it. Can't deny how fun and awesome parts of the game are. It's outweighed the bad for me honestly.",,
"This game is just... fun. It's rough around the edges but it has a heart, and you can feel a dev team behind it that made something worth enjoying. The writing is so much more true to character, the music is amazing as ever, and the little gameplay loops scattered around are just great bits of fun to run about in.

It's not perfect by a long shot, sonic is annoyingly sticky at times, and turning is either slow as a snail, or snaps 90 degrees in a frame. Some of the areas look stunning, others less so. But through all its flaws there's something really great here. The bits that do work really work, and I cannot wait to see sonic team improve this formula further!",,

"Sonic Frontiers is a return to form that fans have been waiting for. Everything from the music, gameplay, character writing, and story are all phenomenal. Sonic no longer feels like a rushed franchise used only for profit, this game has clear evidence of passion. If this is the new bar for Sonic games, I cannot wait to see what's in store.",,
"It has a few flaws but is an enjoyable game to play. The physics are weird at times and the cyberspace stages do suck at times with how you control, it's not like the past boost games stages and some levels aren't made for the new engine and controls. The open world is at least fun and can be challenging at times too, I would pick this game up if you really like Sonic games.",,
"Possibly one of the best Sonic games so far. I constantly ask myself while playing ""Hey, that would be a cool thing to do"" and I do it. The soundtrack is god tier like usual, but how in the hell did they get the Sleeping with Sirens vocalist on this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game? Big the Cat makes an appearance and you can fish, 10/10 for that alone. Sega really put their whole Segussy into this one.",,

"Cons: Kucos area light brown, like all of the structures they're on. Combat mostly boils down to the attack, Sonic Boom, after a point. Not entirely, but a lot.

Pros: It's fun. I love a good Sonic game, and that's a rarity. But this is a good one. Nice story, enjoyable characters and representations of old ones. Fast gameplay, fun levels, and neat open world.

And what a soundtrack.

But yeah, it is literally just Breath of the Wild but Sonic, and that's pretty cool.",,
"Overall score:7/10

Gameplay:
Sonic Frontiers as you know is comprised of two main gameplay styles: open zone, and the more traditional cyberspace stages. Starting with the open zone gameplay is actually pretty fun, the little traversal challenges that are littered throughout the open world can be pretty satisfying to run through. Although later into the game it switches to mostly 2D which was probably the lowest point for the open zone as well as the physics being a bit janky at times. Otherwise, I think this format works well for sonic and is overall just a blast to run around in.
As for the combat I think its serviceable and serves as a good blueprint for a gameplay style that can be improved upon in later titles assuming they don’t just throw it all away in the next title.

Now onto the cyberspace stages which in my opinion, is the worst of the two styles although that doesn’t mean its complete trash. Most of the level design is taken from previous sonic games with some working better in this style then others but what really brings down the experience is my main problem with cyberspace: the physics, it really feels like a boost game with the speed of 06. That doesn’t stop some of the cyberspace stages from being enjoyable, I had a fun time with them and trying to guess what sonic game it was from was pretty fun too (although it was almost always very obvious).

Story:
As to avoid spoiling the story I will make this very brief, I enjoyed the story pretty much up until the end where I have mixed feelings with some of the choices made. Overall, the story is leagues better than what we were getting in earlier titles.

Music:
Sonic music is always pretty good, and this game doesn’t disappoint, pretty banger soundtrack that had me bopping my head throughout most of the game.

Graphics:
For a sonic game, the graphics are ok although I wish the islands had more unique designs or at least looked more interesting. The animations look ok and the combat animations look pretty good although they can be robotic at times.

P.S. while i do recommend this game, I don't think it's worth the $60 unless you're a big enough sonic fan for that not to matter.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is a masterpiece. It's simple. Sure, it isn't perfect, but I love it nonetheless. The gameplay is super fun, the playable characters are unique, the music is absolute fire, the graphics are beautiful, it has a good length, and is pretty polished! The story is really well-written with many references and callbacks to previous titles, but in a natural way. They try to improve the characterisation of the characters, so they are more like how they used to be, before Sonic Colours, and they succeed. It's not perfect, and there are a few issues that I have with this game, but they are much too minuscule of an amount to really matter. Sure, maybe it was a bit rushed, but that doesn't stop it from being wonderful. It's absolutely one of my favourite Sonic games now. I won't spoil anything, but the boss battles are super hype, and the ending is actually a bit emotional. Also, the ending of Another Story is the most hype Sonic ending ever. Go play this game, please!

I've already beaten this game four times, twice on PS5 (one 100% completion run, and the second one was a normal run), then on Switch, and now on Steam as well (also to 100%). Also, all three of the major content updates were fantastic, and I'm glad that they still supported the game for so long, adding on to and improving it. I love this dang game!",,
"A truly refreshing take on what it means to be a Sonic game. Even though it has flaws like all games do, they aren't egregious enough to drag down the experience even remotely.",,
It's fun!,,
"While not perfect, it's really good for a Sonic game. I was captivated by the visuals. It's packed with nostalgia, and there's a ton of challenges. First boss was great.",,
goat,,
"Sonic Team's masterpiece. This game is Sonic's Mario Odyssey. The nature of the open zone brings back the pick up and play, ""easy to learn, hard to master"" nature of the classic Sonic games and adds a whole new dimension to modern Sonic level design. Brilliant!",,
"Frontiers is a bit of a mixed bag, the open zone is incredible and I've been wanted something like it for years prior to the game's reveal, but the cyberspace levels are just kinda lazy and I really hope they'll stop using zones and level design from Generations in the next game. The combo system is a ton of fun though and I'd go out of my way to fight anything and everything when I could, oh and the bosses are raw as ♥♥♥♥. 8/10",,
"Sonic Team's ""Finally I Am Home"" moment.

They finally remembered that they've built a world with history, unsolved mysteries, and lovable characters who had character arcs in the past, but can still grow nevertheless.

They finally remembered that Sonic is the friend we've always wanted but never had, who stands by your side, no questions asked, and brings out the best of everyone.

They finally remembered that Tails is the genius kid who saves Station Square from destruction, rescued Sonic from Prison Island, but still has trouble believing in himself.

They finally remembered that Knuckles is the last of the Echidna, was initially hostile, and still shares some rivalry with Sonic along with their friendship.

They finally remembered that Eggman is a formidable supervillain with standards (and a magnificent stache), who honors his (fr)enemies, and that a part of him is simply a socially awkward middle-aged man who makes friends by plotting world-domination schemes.

They finally remembered that this world (his wooorld) is the reason why a lot of us fell in love with this series, and made characters aware of the events in previous games.

We became invested in the characters, and want to know what happens next.
Maybe they stick around.
Maybe they move on.
Maybe they return some time later, a hero, a villain, or a secret agent.
We want to find out how they change.
We want to see how the changes in one character affect others.

Yes, the gameplay is mostly ""from A to B"" and ""Aw ♥♥♥♥ I gotta collect more of these?"" which gets monotonous and repetitive at times but, similar to the Adventure games, because you simply want to know what happens next, both in the present and in the past. You want to know so bad that you just keep pushing forward.
Also the view is magnificent.

Yes, bits of the plot doesn't make sense, but it didn't stop me from playing the second half mostly covered in tears, from the story, from characters being relatable, from nostalgia, and from the happiness that ""somebody DO remember.""

With Sonic Frontiers, Sonic Team told us loud and clear: ""We're back.""
Now I just hope, nostalgia aside, after more than 15 years of silence, this world we know and love can live and grow once again.

Oh and make sure to go fish and get all of Eggman's voice memos.
Those were such a treat.",,
"So far I've reached the third island and what I've played is really good. I have my gripes, but mostly it's satisfaction and feelings of bliss.
+ Traversal & filling out the maps of the open zones is genuinely fun and addicting.
+ Combat is well made. The boss fights and mini bosses in particular are phenomenal. Simple enough to understand and get accustomed to, but deep enough to be engaging and to express yourself. Seriously, linking together a string of well executed attacks and combos makes you feel like a bad-ass. It's the highlight of the game for me.
+ Controls feel really nice, especially since you can customize them to a great degree. From button mapping to the smallest things like Sonic's physics and stats.
+ Aesthetically & graphically, the game looks pretty good.
+ I love the music A LOT. They're very atmospheric in the open world, and the Cyber Space and boss tracks are legendary. Give it a listen.

- The game's collectible economy is very unbalanced. It's very easy to get huge amounts of progression based items, purple coins, rings, etc. with very little effort. Some tweaks here would help immensely.
- Pop in can get pretty bad at times and I've had some frame rate issues. Overall, there are a fair bit of technical problems here that warrant a patch or two.
- Cyber Space, while somewhat fun in their own right, aren't as deep, engaging, or fast-paced as older titles that focus on the boost formula action stages as the main draw. They just don't compare to Unleashed, Colors, Generations, or Forces imo.

Won't say anything on story rn since I'm not done with it yet. But everything else makes Frontiers well worth the $60.",,
"I don't love this game, but I don't hate it either. I have mixed feelings.
The writing of the game is definitely a step in the right direction. I do love the vast options of movesets Sonic has as well. The ""open zone"" sections can be fun for a little bit, but after a while can get very stale. I hate the nostalgia pandering in this game (it's seriously over done with Sonic) and am most disappointed that the cyberspace stages don't have original level designs/reuse geometry from past Sonic game levels.
As for the soundtracks for the game, they are absolute master pieces. Sonic Team always does well with soundtracks (in my opinion).
I also have to take points off this game for taking a lot of ideas from both Breath of the Wild and Shadow of the Colossus. Sonic used to be unique and have it's own forumla/thing going on back in the old days and I miss that.
It's kinda sad in a way that this is one of the best Sonic games we have gotten in a while. I hope future Sonic games will be more original and no longer will rely on nostalgia pandering, since it's hurting the series more than it is helping it.

As for update 3:
Great update. The story writing definitely got better. The gameplay itself however is impossible to beat on hard mode and you must beat it on easy mode in order to finish it. Some of the trials feel unbalanced too.",,
"been a while since sega made a decent 3d sonic game I bought it with low expectations but was surprised to see that after years of trying they finally made it work.

even though the game can be bad at some parts like

having to increase your speed or ring capacity 1 level at a time
platforms just spawning when you´re close
grass rendering in a very weird way
60 to 30 fps cap

I would say its worth the price the boss fights are amazing and the story is very good
and like always when it comes to the soundtrack Sega never misses its glorious as always
the game also has a lot of references to previous games I liked that a lot id give it a 7/10 hope sega keeps doing their games like this in the future

also don´t forget to grab big´s big purple coins so that you can play with his rod ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)",,

"One of the best Sonic Game's from recent times! The story is a breath of fresh air amount of callbacks to previous Sonic game is fantastic. Helps make everything feel connected and the new additions to Sonic's lore is great!. I really enjoyed the Cyberspace Stages, especially the Stages calling back to Levels from Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Adventure 2. Music, especially for the main bosses slap, and certainly not something I'd expect to hear from a Sonic Game of all things. Running around as Sonic in an open area is like my younger self's dream come true and it's great seeing the chemistry between the characters and ACTUAL CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!

That being said I do have a few gripes with the game. I'll start off with the physics in the Cyberspace levels. Losing all my speed as I jump doesn't feel too great (this also applies to the overworld) and Sonic does feels a little slow on the 2D stages, even while boosting. Some of the enemies are a little annoying as they force the Camera to look straight at them, even as you are speeding along and not wanting to fight anything. This can be especially annoying with the 'Guardians'. Somewhat related is when you reach Ring cap and get your 'Super Boost', I don't think there needed to be a short cutscene every time one reaches the cap.

Final gripe is the 'Star Shower Slots'. They can be distracting if you just want to speed through an island don't want to put up with them. I do wish there was an option to 'opt-out' of doing it as it can be distracting and has caused me to speed off a cliff and miss a jump a few times.

Other than the issues above, which I'm sure some of those issues could be fixed with a patch or the community themselves will mod some fixes in, I do hope Sonic Team expands on this style of game play. It's fresh, fun and you feel free running around at high speed as Sonic going around corkscrew loops and grinding on rails to your hearts content. Feels like a natural transition from the 'Boost' gameplay of Unleashed, Colours, Generations and Forces. I definitely recommend this to people getting into the series for the first time!",,
"Now THIS is a Sonic game I feel like everyone should play and that I can recommend to everyone. If the future of Sonic is more like this, then I have high hopes and look forward to what's ahead! There's obviously a lot the developers could still learn and implement in future titles, but for now this is a great revitalization of the Sonic franchise!",,
"I binged sonic frontiers to finish the story last night. I WOULD NOT let people spoil it for me.

I feel comfortable saying this is the best 3d sonic since the Dreamcast.

Absolutely the best of any mutations of the ""boost gameplay"" formula.

The story and spectacle were absolutely phenomenal for Sonic - and while that bar was low to start with, this story clearly recognised all of the weak points in Sonic's past stories and characterisations, and made a refreshingly decisive move to correct them. Successfully, IMO.

I won't go into detail right now about the story because absolutely everything that excited me was also something I didn't want spoiled for me.

Overall the game played the best in decades, and the story both satisfied and fascinated me. I hope this is the new standard for Sonic.

Also: Loved the music.",,

This was 100% a high school finals project that did not get an A,,
"Sonic Frontiers while not perfect, gives a really good formula for future games to further improve on. The controls in the open world are really tight, the story and writing is some of the best in the series, the music is great featuring a lot of guest singers and the use of genres I've never expected to hear in a Sonic game like metalcore, combat while simple, is surprisingly quite good with some pretty fun enemies and bosses to fight, and Cyberspace is mostly good but was honestly the most disappointing part of the game for me. Over all, I would say this game is around a 7.8/10",,
"Currently at the 3rd island and so far this game has been incredible. It's not perfect, but it offers a fun and rewarding gameplay loop, a decent story with great writing, an AMAZING soundtrack, and some of the hypest boss fights I've played. It could use some improvements (namely in the control of cyberspace and in game difficulty) but overall I'd heavily recommend.",,
"It’s not gonna be everyone’s cup of tea. There’s quite a bit of open world grinding and exploration. The action stages are simple and only the 2d ones so far have had branching paths. You have little missions in them but they’re also simple as “clear the level in 45 seconds.” The combat is fun and decent, so far not too tough but some enemies are a bit annoying. The game has quite a bit of pop in but for a lot of situations I don’t mind it. You get a better view of the world without the grind rails and stuff showing up till you’re near them. The important bits load nicely. Overall I’d give the game like an 8/10 so far but I’m not very far in cause I’m engrossed in the open world.",,

If your new or returning Sonic fan you need to play this game,,
In my Honest opinion if i exclude sonic mania this is the best Sonic the Hedgehog since Sonic and Knuckles. i could not get into the game play as much with the titles between Sonic adventure all the way up to Sonic Forcres. from what i have played so far it is well executed compared to past Sonic titles,,
"I felt so betrayed when i found out the game doesn't actually have 5 islands and the last one is just more of the first with even a re skin of the first boss for the final boss. Regardless, this game while having so much content that satisfied and inspired me, NEEDS to be improved in a sequel, this groundwork NEEDS to be perfected.

Your usual praise & complain list :
-Exploration as Sonic is great, even if platforming and momentum is a little scuffed, jumping off rails and high platforms to shortcut obstacle courses feels amazing.
-Combat is cinematic and awesome but dear god FIX THE PARRY ITS SO STUPID, plus there should be an energy meter that works like mana because there is no reason for you to use the moves you get early in the game again after you get the op last attacks.
-Character writing and Voice Acting (aka mostly Roger's) are problably the best they've ever been, so happy to get a Sonic that takes the situation seriously again and doesnt have to constantly annoy the enemies with dumb jokes.
The Visuals are Great (with sonic looking out of place in a realistic environment and the pop in being the obvious problems).
-The Titans (except the last one) blew me away the first time i fought them but MAKE THEM HARDER, THE PARRY DESTROYS ALL OF THEM! And making the amount of rings you had before the last emerald set the amount of time you have to defeat them is dumb. Let it just be a set amount and make Super Sonic lose rings with every hit the titans land.
-The Soundtrack is UNDEFEATABLE.

I pray for sequel. Easiest pick for best sonic game if it happens and fixes all of this with more islands and titans.",,

"Genuinely quite astonished by how much I am being surprised by this game!
I know this game may be hit or miss with many of the fanbase, but I feel like much more care has been put into this game compared to that of past entries.

This especially being apparent with the story - which (as of 6 hours of gameplay, and completion of the first island) has me really engrossed and thrilled by seeing (what I believe to be) real interactions between sonic and other characters. The dialogue has yet to hit me negatively in any way, and always strikes me as a realistic interpretation of how these characters would and should act. (The new tonal shift for each character, I believe will be entirely preference on each individual and how you like your Sonic - My opinion is that the lower more relaxed tone fits much better with the mystery and intrigue of the story)

However, the in-game cutscenes are sometimes fairly awkward in their animation - most of the time they take it fairly light in the character's movement, which can be underwhelming, but also don't follow the over-exaggerated nature of previous Sonic games which is much more natural. Opposed to this, some cutscenes do show quite a bit of dynamic in movement as well as expression when needed, and it fits well into the situations they are implemented.

The graphics are good - (for me personally, as of reaching the second island, I feel a lot more polish went into the second island, compared to that of the first.)

The gameplay is very fun! It definitely plays like 'Sonic in Breath of the Wild', and with the puzzles and enemies this can be quite obvious of a comparison. Yet, it still feels new all the same. The combat with each new skill gets more fun and creative, and each new enemy actually requires a new way to think about defeating it - each one creating a unique method you have to think about before taking it down.

As a general perspective on the game, I am extremely happy to see Sega and Sonic team taking a leap of faith in a new direction (at least for them, as mainline titles go). I would recommend any Sonic fan play this game.",,

A VERY GOOD GAME

Update since the updates:
Ever since the addition of momentum, the spin dash and adding new playable characters. I will say that this is my personal favourite Sonic game out of all the games there are. Very fun to break the game, a great OST to listen to, and more! Thank you for everything Sonic Team & SEGA, excited to play the next game!",,
"As a huge Sonic fan, I was looking forward to this one. A lot of people kept hating on it before launch saying it was going to be ""Sonic 06"" bad. They couldn't be further from wrong if they tried.

The game at first seems slow paced, but as you progress through the open world (which seems to take center stage over the individual ""cyberspace levels"") you'll find a lot of distractions from enemies, pathways, mini-games, puzzles (a bit too easy I think), and other activities are all about the map. The best parts are the mini-bosses which are all unique (after the first island) and the Titan battles.

The music while in the open world is great. Once you're in the levels, music is very generic most of the time. Only a few levels were interesting or entertaining. The rest were generic, freeware sounding EDM tracks by Sound Cloud musicians.

Graphics-wise, the game is pretty impressive for a Sonic game that it almost reminds me of an Unreal Engine game. Sonic & Team look great. I don't care too much for the voice actor for Sonic and Eggman, but the rest are great. I especially like how Amy sounds a lot more grownup and mature and not the simple-minded, Sonic crazed bimbo she has been portrayed as in other Sonic games and shows.

The story itself is also more mature this time around which is a great change of pace, but it can feel a bit disjointed by all the constant interruptions caused by finding each characters emblems that are required to unlock conversations. Things seem fairly lighthearted and run-of-the-mill for a Sonic game up until almost the end of the first island when ish suddenly gets real.

The individual stages are VERY short, nothing like in past games where stage-by-stage gameplay was center stage in past games. Each stage is, at your best performance, less than a minute long. The red coins are a lot easier to get instead of easily missed like in past Sonic games. Often I find myself clearing every stage goal in the first try, including beating the time ranking and collecting all red coins in one go. I honestly have more fun in the open world just exploring, solving puzzles and fighting enemies and bosses than actually playing the stages. The cyberspace stages are VERY short clips of stages from past Sonic games like classic Green Hill Zone, Chemical Plant, City Escape, and other iconic stages. Unfortunately, none of the music came along with them (see the generic, royalty-free, Sound Cloud EDM comment above).

Definitely looking forward to completing this game 100% and I'd recommend anyone who enjoys Sonic games to at least give it a try.",,

But in all seriousness: I don't recommend this game.

It feels empty, unfinished and very badly written. The story is the worst story I've ever seen in a Sonic game, it's empty, it doesn't make sense and the voice direction is really bad, as the characters are rigid and emotionless. Most dialogue doesn't even make sense and feel very awkward.

While I do like this game is trying to be different, it doesn't feel like a true Sonic game to me. The open world feels empty, and doesn't really fit the upbeat Sonic colors/vibe it normally has. The task are very simple and repetitive, and only fill up a very bit of the map. I hated the towers in Assassin's Creed to see more parts of the map, but this is even worse, as it goes slower and there's more pointless stuff to do.

The thing I like the most are the Cyberspace levels, and level 1-2 are a very good example where this game works and shine. The levels are colorful, upbeat, and are mostly only 3D, which I like, because I don't want 2D levels in a 3D Sonic game. If I wanted to play 2D, I would've played Mania/Origins. But even the Cyberspace levels have a major flaw later. They try to mix platforming and going fast together, and this doesn't work.

You need to build your levels about going fast, because it's what Sonic does. If you want precise platforming, that fits in a Mario game, as Mario's movement is very fluid and precise itself. Sonic feels clunky for jumping from small platform to platform, and this leads to frustration as other Cyberspace levels where they try to mix going fast and platforming, because you will fall down the map and die because you were going too fast. Going fast in a Sonic game shouldn't punish you in any way. Also, the levels are way too short again, only taking one or two minutes to complete.

Again, I like that Sonic Team is trying to find a formula, but it feels like they're just making stuff up and throw random ♥♥♥♥ at the wall and see what sticks. It's very easy, make more games like Sonic Mania if you want 2D sonic. If you want a more open-space level design with platforming, that worked in the Adventure series, and if you want Sonic to go very fast, stay with the Boost formula like the full 3D stages in Generations. Mixing everything together takes everything away and makes nothing work in the end.

I don't get why Sonic Team can't create a good Sonic game anymore, or just try to change the formula everytime. Give the fans what they want, we've been asking for Adventure 3 for ages, but to be honest, I don't even trust them that they can make that a decent game anymore. It breaks my childhood heart, but this is the last Sonic game I will buy on release. The game is clunky, is filled with bugs, and it doesn't have any soul in the slightest.

I'm very frustrated as I don't like this game at all, and slowly start the hate it more the more I play it. I wanted to love this game so badly, but sadly, I don't. If you want to go really fast with the boost formula, buy Generations. If you want a mix of platforming, action, speed, and a decent story, buy Adventure 2. If you love Classic 2D, buy Mania. This game doesn't fit any of those niches and fails to deliver a true Sonic game experience, as it tries to mix everything and ultimately fails to deliver anything at all. There are some good Cyberspace levels where the 3D boost formula does shine, but that's the only good thing I can say about this game. Oh, and the new combat system feels like a step up, but ultimately fails as well, as it is buggy, some inputs just flat out don't work, or enemies are buggy as hell.

Again, I do not recommend this game, and I wish I could, but I can't. The future for Sonic games doesn't shine bright for me anymore, as they can't capture the magic as it did literally two decades ago.",,
I am a little less than one hour into this game and it is fantastic! The platforming and speed is everything you want in a sonic game. Too bad it appears to be capped at 60FPS but after speeding through my first 2 challenges I didn't even notice. I hope everyone who plays this game has an excellent experience with it. This is definitely a SEGA game I would recommend.,,
hedgehog go woosh,,
"Sonic fans are eating good. Best part was the baseball minigame; genre defining, honestly.",,
"I previously left a negative review cause of poor performance but after fixing it, I'm recommending this game cause it's genuinely good.

The game has that classic 3D Sonic jank we're used to, but aside that it is a fresh breath of air for Sonic and it sets a good path forward for future games and they will hopefully improve upon this formula that is very promising.

In the open world, Sonic feels good to play with, he's responsive and can go very fast. The world isn't anything superb, there is pop-in, the rails and puzzles don't always fit in perfectly, but the exploration and freedom make for an enjoyable experience.

The Combat is great, it's not the most complex system and skill tree, but if this was the gameplay for the Werehog stages, you wouldn't hear a single complaint for Unleashed.

The Cyberspace is really fun aswell, I dislike some aspects about it, like the fact that there is only 3 themes used, the boost doesn't feel good, and the homing not being as smooth. However, these are all intentional so it may come down to personal preference. The level design is mostly good, we have stages from games like Generations, Adventure,etc.

The soundtrack for these stages are really good, but speaking of soundtrack, I just have to mention the boss music and the overall OST. It. Is. Really. Good. I got goosebumps from the boss music and felt like I was in a Sonic AMV lol, and I have to say, this is the best we have ever seen of Super Sonic period.

While this game has alot of issues and stuff that could be way more polished, it really does feel like the team put in a lot of work and passion into the game. I wouldn't recommend the game full price if you're not a huge sonic fan, but I have to say it really feels like Sonic is back.

TLDR: Fun Gameplay, Fun Combat, Amazing OST, Not the best open world and it lacks a lot of polish, but this is the best 3D Sonic game in a long time. Maybe not worth Full Price unless you're a big fan.",,
Best game I've played in years.,,
"Best sonic game in at least 10 years, plus more great stuff coming",,
amazing game holy,,
This is my first Sonic experience and it has been amazing so far!,,
"Awesome! Great graphics (decent computer needed). Colourful and just lovely!
As an old Sonic fan that started with my butt on the livingroom floor next to my SEGA Megadrive loaded with Sonic the hedgehog 1 or 2, this game really gives a nostalgic feeling even though it's brand new with A LOT more action commands than just Spin Dash, jump, duck/roll and running fast.

Some of you weak and slow phased people with motion sickness and so on, might want to slow down the speed in settings. Or maybe just don't buy the game, It's the fastest hedgehog in the world you'll be playing after all. Gotta go fast!",,
"Best 3d Sonic game since the adventure games, but it does have its fair share of problems with the camera and the controls not responding to the input you're asking it to do on some occasions, but that seems to be a normal thing with these Sonic games. The soundtrack for this game is amazing and I love that you can find and unlock tunes from previous Sonic games to listen to while you play. Overall, a great Sonic game for your collection. It made the hedgehog in my pants do a speed dash :D",,
"Completed as of writing this review: 100%.

Absolutely enjoyed my time with this game 100%'ing it and just exploring everything! The story is surprisingly good with all those details and references! The characters are finally written with some genuine human-like behavior and like-able at that! The gameplay physics need some work though, as this still uses Lost World / Forces movement! The exploration aspect is very addictive and not that strict as we have Big The Cat for help. The music is very different and really great to listen to, and cyberspace themes are such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bangers all around! The performance kinda ruined my experience though, as there are optimization issues. There are some enemies I disliked, and there are some things I'd call messy, but it's not a huge drawback from enjoyment as I can see the ambition of Sonic Team and how this is a good new direction for the series. Open-world fits Sonic perfectly (they hired this man) and I can finally say, Sonic has improved yet again and this game has set good expectations for the decade as of now.",,

"If you love 3D Sonic games like Colors, Generations, and the day time Unleashed stages, then this game will live up to your expectations because it certainly met up to mine. The cyberspace stages are cool throwbacks, the maps are fun to explore and run around, the songs are bangers, the story is interesting. Sonic Team really has made a good game and I would recommend both old and new Sonic players to try this game out. I promise you, you won't be disappointed.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is a game that has set out what I've always dreamed of since I was a young lad. Being able to just go fast at almost any location, just like they show Sonic doing in cutscenes. There's many a time where I've done something in this game, stopped and gone, ""A decade ago, I would have only been able to witness these moves. And now here I am playing them""

The game does offer a good variety of play styles aside from running and platforming. Combat, puzzle and exploration are high up on that docket.

The only negative this game has going is challenge zones that are strictly 2-d seem to have broken physics. Sonic is incredibly sluggish, even when at full speed.",,
"As the first mainline Sonic entry in 5 years since the dumpster fire that was Forces, Sonic Frontiers was an unpolished game at release, but has since had a number of improvements that tidied up many of its flaws. The spin dash makes travelling the open world a fun experience that allows you to use uneven terrain to fly into the air and cover long distances, and the overwhelming amount of customisation on Sonic's boost speed, starting speed, and the greatest complaint about the game on release, the amount of speed reduction from jumping, allows the player to play Frontiers with the feeling they prefer. However, the last DLC announced by Sonic Team has been released, and unfortunately in my opinion it is a fun disappointment. Out of the three new playable characters introduced, Amy not only feels the most polished, but is also the only one that I would go out of my way to play with again. Knuckles and Tails both have flying/gliding mechanics that kill momentum and feel janky to use, and Tails not having a homing attack restricts his playability outside of any level design that is not made specifically for him. The DLC attempts to rewrite Frontiers' lackluster ending, and although I believe it does that in the case of the boss fight and Sonic's new transformation, there are parts of the original ending I preferred more. On release, Sonic Frontiers was a 7/10, and the changes made, whilst nice, haven't done a lot to change that. As a die hard Sonic fan I greatly enjoyed my time with Frontiers, and I am hopeful for the future of the blue blur. :)",,
Big the cat is in this game.,,
"I'm not even sure if it's a ""Return to Form"" if Sonic has never been this good before.",,
"Before I begin the review, here's some advice regarding the content in the final update:

If you value your sanity, DO NOT play it on Normal or Hard. They seriously overtuned the challenges with the new towers, trials and cyberspace levels, which made a lot of stuff very frustrating and sometimes unfair to get through in those difficulties. Easy mode makes things a lot more fair, but still challenging, trust me.

With that out of the way, this is a pretty great game that has a lot of ups and downs and ends in a satisfying and (a bit too much) challenging way.

With all of the updates this game received, movement is super fun now, you can experiment with many ways to tackle reaching anywhere you like by spin dashing and/or boosting to adquire speed and then launching yourself from all kinds of places, its just so much fun.

All of the bosses are the greatest this series has ever seen, with the last one previously being extremely underwhelming but now being absolutely crazy good. They are so unbelievably hype.

This latest update brought us new characters to play as well, and they are generally pretty fun to move around with, Tails and Amy especially with their flying and tarot card gliding abilities, respectively. The only one I thought was kind of bad was Knuckles with his slow startup moves and incredibly janky gliding, which can be quite frustrating to use. However, one thing that really sucks about all of them is the fact that they are generally completely useless in combat, since every enemy in the new story is so unbelievably powerful that their attacks can barely make a dent on them, even more so due to the fact they have no combos, unlike Sonic. So, you generally want to completely avoid fighting with them, which really sucks since I think the fighting in this game is super fun.

The story that was pretty good but ended on a weak note is now excellent with this new update. It's a breath of fresh air for this series that had mediocre and bad stories for the longest time, honestly.

There are some more things I found bad with this game, like the very strange way that the third island is structured with its heavy use of 2D sections in an open area, which is very contradictory to how the game is supposed to work, the pop-in can be quite bad at times, especially if you're moving really fast in the air, and also the IMMENSE difficulty spikes that the new story brought with its unfair challenges.

But, overall, this is a pretty good game. It has its flaws, but the developers have fixed a good portion of the ones I had over time (while introducing a few more in this new update, but hopefully it gets patched soon).",,
"If someone sees this post,
Sanic. That is all",,
its a very good game with good rock music got good story line,,
"I was afraid going open-world would make the game boring and tedious but it's still basically the same style of game as ever... which might be good or bad depending if that's your thing. But it's my thing so no problem really.

e: I got to the credits and I need to revise this review. It took a little bit of time to fully warm up to this game and what it wants, because it does make changes from older titles (Sonic just has a lot more abilities and the handling is a bit different, and the overworld is unlike anything in previous titles). I think this has to be one of the top all-time Sonic games. It really just does a lot right.

The combat is new, but it works. When you start out, it feels a bit like Shadow in Sonic 2006:
homing attack and then mash X until the combo ends.As you start to get the hang of combat and fill out your skill tree, dispatching enemies with extended combos brings as much satisfaction as the classic running gameplay.

The game solves the essential boredom issue that often plagues open worlds with two measures: 1) traversing the world is itself a lot of fun and suffused with fun platforming challenges 2) as you complete more tasks, you add more rails and otherwise unlock more of the world, making the world more, rather than less, interesting as you tick off items.

If you're worried about missing out on the traditional Sonic gameplay, no worries. The Cyberspace stages do a great job of scratching the itch for short levels to polish your runs of.

But what's probably most surprising is I found myself invested in the story of the game, which was not only full of callbacks to older games, but also was written in a way to be enjoyable. The last time I felt invested in a Sonic story was probably... never really, and stuff like Colors you really just want to get through it as fast as possible.

I do miss the Crush 40 music though. I think they could bring that back.",,
3 words: Sonic is back,,
Update 3 is peak sonic kino,,
"Hot damn they actually did it. It only took them ten years to make a decent 3d Sonic game and they delivered with (almost) flying colors. Despite the game having its issues (some of which can be fixed with modding thankfully), this is a very promising look for Sonic's future. They gotta keep this tone and vibe up and this funky blue fella could finally shake off the years of rust that's been building up for far too long. For once, it feels like Sonic Team finally have confidence in putting out something with real SPEED to it, the general movement feels so good to just blitz through everything and chaining one boost after another.

All I personally ask is that they leave 2D Sonic behind all together and just not include any of the forced camera angles because in the second half of the game it gets real tedious being forced into these angles that you could easily bypass by just playing in 3D instead. It absolutely kills the flow and feels awful to control because one minute you're soaring through and suddenly you just snap into place for another 2d segment in the middle of the air.

All that being said, the game's pretty damn great and I look forward to playing as Knuckles when that update goes live- I miss my boy like you wouldn't believe.",,
"This game somehow managed to get worse the further I went. Anytime I tried to compliment something about the game it would do something to piss me off without fail. Glitches were thankfully sparse, although there were times when the general jank of the game made me think either collision was broken or elements weren't being loaded in.

As for the open-""zone"" game-play, it doesn't have much more depth than one of those fan-made tech demos you see come out on occasion. The platforming related collectibles only serve as upgrade fodder and as such don't feel rewarding to collect, so the random rails and boxes scattered about are easy to just refuse to interact with thanks to that. God-forbid the story put a goal marker in the sky because the sheer quantity of garbage scattered about will make it difficult to even know where to start gaining height.

The combat is boring as all hell. The bosses are mostly spectacle. You have a whole skill tree to unlock, but can be just as effective in combat by spamming buttons. Some enemies will occasionally either have attacks that barely get choreographed or will bottleneck you into using the Cyloop first, limiting what little freedom combat gives you.

The Cyloop is also a somewhat baffling inclusion. It's a gimmick move that you have to use for puzzle solving and the occasional enemy, but it can also just infinity give you rings and certain collectibles? You can genuinely just spam it and get max rings at any given moment if you're a bit patient. I don't understand what the logic is here.

Speaking of cheesing collectibles, Big's fishing mini-game lets you cash in for an odd amount of keys and gears, which are supposed to be unlocked by fighting mini-bosses and exploring the islands. I don't enjoy either of those things, so Big the Cat is a very welcome sight in that regard, though I'd hardly call bypassing game-play via an A-Button simulator good game design. Fishing was the only part of the game I fully enjoyed, despite the overly simple game-play.

Cyberspace sucks and feels stiff. Many stages are reusing older level layouts without shame and not doing anything interesting with them, which is especially frustrating considering these layouts were made for very different game-play styles. Others are just a level dedicated to a specific gimmick or obstacle. Most felt less like levels and more like the Challenges in Sonic Generations, which I suppose could be the point, but if extra content is going to be bad content then I'd rather it not be there at all. Often Cyberspace just comes off as filler material to use as a selling point.

The Ancients suck. I'm not opposed to having ancient aliens because we've pretty much already done that but the game barely explores their lore. Saying the Chaos Emeralds are from space and arrived with those aliens is incredibly stupid considering this game seems to want to establish a firm canon that includes things like Adventure and Unleashed. I guess it can work but it just feels especially jarring because apparently the Master Emerald was already on Earth? Why? They just drop this information without explaining any of it. My bigger issue is potentially attempting to alter lore established in Sonic Adventure by making the Ancients look nearly identical to Chaos. What really aggravates me is that they're vague about it. Chaos being a mutated Chao and essentially just a scared and angry child is an important part of the impact of that game's ending, so I'm not excited for the idea that they're retconning that. As for the larger lore surrounding the Ancients: I don't care. They aren't given much personality because every flashback with them is their race going extinct, so anytime they try to give snippets about their technology and culture I just can't find any ♥♥♥♥♥ to give about it.

When the story wasn't revolving around the Ancients, it was still bad. The characters are either talking about how weird things on the islands are or going through some small inconsequential arc. The biggest issue really is that everyone just feels wrong. None of the characters feel like themselves because the whole time they're either confused about the circumstances they're in or are taking things far too seriously. Also the whole cyber corruption thing just kinda happens? Sonic's idle animations show him in different stages of exhaustion but I don't recall it ever coming up in any conversations before the big group sacrifice scene.

Speaking of sacrifices, what the ♥♥♥♥ is that ending? This big, devastating enemy that wiped out the Ancients through their advanced tech and planning is... the moon but red? And the fight itself is just a rehash of a bullet-hell mini-game from earlier in the game while the creatively named ""The End"" monologues the most generic ""I am death you will die"" nonsense you can imagine. They build this enemy up as something unimaginably powerful but then it's just a circle that says a bunch of nothing and then dies when Sage suicide bombs it with one of the mechs it was supposed to have defeated in the past. Also, why did she suicide bomb it? She like knocks Sonic away like he was about to be killed and then flies straight through The End, but nothing was even happening.

I like Sage in concept and design, but this game's writing does it's best to make me want her gone forever.

I don't want to come off as hateful towards the VAs, but the acting definitely wasn't helping matters. It's 100% on the direction here as even actors we've gotten great performances from in the past just sounded either off or like they weren't really paying attention. Roger Craig Smith's new take on Sonic is definitely the worst I've heard because it's just Roger but deeper now. I've never felt like Roger had the necessary energy for Sonic, but this new direction is even further off the mark than before.

Before Update 3, there a couple miscellaneous issues I want to just list off. One island has a giant bridge you have to lower that you can run up at full speed, but despite having enough speed and height to cross the gap, there's an invisible wall in this open-""zone"" game to prevent you from doing that. The initial launch required you to upgrade attack and defense one level at a time, which isn't the case anymore but I'm reviewing what I played and that was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ infuriating. Sometimes Sonic will stick to terrain when you expect him to launch off into the trick system, while sometimes the opposite is the case, either way it lead to unfair deaths more than once.

♥♥♥♥ Update 3. There's a difference between difficulty and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ design. Perfect Parry is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanic considering you're expected to nail frame-perfects with an otherwise generous mechanic that you can beat the original game without using more than once or twice. The final fight also wants you to target the neck but doesn't let you unless you hit the dodge buttons and that just doesn't seem intentional. Knuckles is back to Sonic Boom with climbing being restricted to designated walls and an infinite height exploit, with the added bonus of his glide having a delay at the beginning. Including the Sonic Adventure 2 mech for Tails is cheap fanservice and also seems to allow infinite height that makes his standard flight redundant? Amy is like easy mode with both a triple jump and glide at the cost of lowered speed. All around none of them control different enough from Sonic to make this worthwhile aside from Tails, but that's just because he can just fly around freely. Platforming sections were color-coded and I still felt like I was able to just break things without trying as any character because they're so similar. The story also wasn't really changed. They basically just removed Sage's fake-out death and had Sonic unironically say ""Forgive me master, but I must go all-out just this once.""

I'm out of characters but I have so many more issues. In short: ♥♥♥♥ this terrible mess of a game. Why does everyone seem to think it's peak Sonic?",,
A real change of pace :3,,
almost as fun as spreading misinformation online,,

decent game...,,
"Its a over all good game, but the repeated cutscenes get very old and skipping them doesn't mitigate this when you're having to skip 2 per chaos emerald per zone and 1 for every story unlock as Sonic slowly pours tokens into the 'memories' to unlock them.

There are three things that made me not enjoy this game as much as I could.

1. There are dozens of instances of the game's tutorials not actually explaining how to do things. An example would be the tip/tutorial for using Super Sonic says something along the lines: Sonic controls differently in super mode, use these new controls to win. That's cool, but what are the control differences? This happens a lot throughout the game mainly when the game tries to give you hints on how to beat enemies that aren't very well telegraphed.

2. Mini games in the story are not fun. From the 'Koko round up' to the 'hacking bullet hell' they are all put together in a way that feels like time wasn't take to make sure they were enjoyable to play. One of the final minigames is a bullet hell that places enemies where you can only destroy them by smashing into them and losing lives.

3. Pop in from bad rendering distances. You only render things that are 15ft or so in front of sonic, making it difficult to find things if you aren't right on top of them already. This is 15ft or so in every direction. There is no option to increase the render distance and you can mod it, but this annoying 'catch the shooting stars' mini game spawns so many items that your game will crash every time until you uninstall it. The pop in alone was annoying enough just because there are so many things you will miss that I considered using the fishing minigame to unlock everything.

By the final zone because of these three things, I had given up on progressing/unlocking properly and just maxed the fishing so I could instant unlock everything and beat the game because it was starting to feel more like a chore than anything else for me. At the same time, I can see how this game is perfect for die hard sonic fans, kids, and people who just aren't super picky like me, if none of the three things I've pointed out will discourage you, this is easily worth it's sale price of $42",,
it's alright,,
Feels like a natural step forward from the Dreamcast games. Lots of challenge and customization possibilities.,,
"This game is the best 3-D Sonic game to date, it's still jank as hell in places, but I'd be lying if there wasn't charm, effort and passion for Sonic fans. The games been out for a bit, but still rather post a review than never. Also the OPST slaps hard, as all Sonic games should. 7.5/10 :)",,

Definitely a step in the right direction for the Sonic franchise. Would love to see how Sonic Team expands on the gameplay for the next entry!,,

"Product received for free

I absolutly LOVE this game. Stunning graphics, Impressive controls for being an open world sonic game and an amazing story to match...
However there is a huge BUT...
My game freezes and instantly crashes after a while of playing it. It can be between half an hour and 2 hours of playing. It happens unpredictably, during gamplay or cutscenes.
Even after the game crashes it refuses to turn on. I will need to restart my computer 1-2 times for it to get running again. Ive searched it up online and there seems to be nothing that helps, basic stuff such as refresh integrity files, update windows/graghics routines but nothing helps.",,
"Just finished the game and really loved it solid 8/10 better than Generations in my humble opinion

The story is a 8/10 for me the story telling is great and I love all the new history they added can't wait for the more

Game play is a a mixed bag while in the open world Sonic controls great in cyberspace it feels stiff and the level design should be amazing since it's mainly recreation of old levels almost 1 to 1 but something feels off and the animations are still sorta lacking for the attacks but fighting is a ton of fun also the open world just made me feel like we need momentum back more than ever

Graphics are 10/10 in terms of looks and art style but the pop in is annoying but I can ignore it most of the time

Characters are awesome in this game love their writing and dialog although sometimes the animation for them is a bit off

The only real thing keeping the game from being a 9/10 for me is the required amount of things that you need to collect and the final fight is a huge let down",,
"Right step in right direction.
Needs more polishing for sure and more time to develop and expand, but this is what we always wanted thank you Sonic Team.",,

"Best 3D Sonic game since Generations, maybe even better than Generations. Little bit of jank here and there, but that's not something Sonic games have ever been free of, especially the adventure games.

Hoping Sega sticks to this formula for the next game and improves upon it. After that we may just have the best 3D sonic game to date.

Where it is now though, It's definitely up in the top 3 for me.",,

"The gameplay is very smooth and refreshing. Especially with the new combat mechanics and movement. The story so far is interesting and the bosses are challenging. I can't say much yet since I only have 5 hours on it but so far, very well done SEGA.",,
"Amazing game! If the controls feel a bit floaty or stiff, try messing with the controls to your liking in the game settings. My only gripes so far are that the cyberspace controls feel a bit iffy (but I'm sure modders will add the open zone controls into cyberspace) and that the graphics aren't the absolute best, but still beautiful nonetheless.",,

"I'll be completely honest
The game's lovely, it feels great to run around the islands, the enemies and specially the bosses are a sight to behold and they're (mostly) fun to fight, but this game is undeniably rough around the edges.
You can tell the Sonic team was experimenting a lot with frontiers when it came to combat, open-world, etc etc.
The combat is good but it definitely needs more refinement
As it stands, it's just a flashy set of moves that are annoying to actually combo.
Also, most of the moves either end up becoming dumb OP through stats leveling up or they're too useless to deal damage hard and fast, which is a necessity in a lot of situations, specially when it comes to those mini-bosses that only give you a fairly small window to attack them.
When it comes to progression, think of it as a fast-paced Collect-a-thon, pretty much
The formula is ""Go to island>Run around the map and collect character tokens>Talk to a character (and maybe do a small and short minigame)>repeat the last two points 5 times>Go through cyberspace levels (which is hell in itself) to unlock emerald keys>Find and acquire the chaos emeralds for the super sonic transformation>actually fight the boss.
But here's the thing, the map won't unlock itself, you actively need to complete the extreme amount of minigames spread around the island to unlock PORTIONS of the map.
Long story short, 90% of the stuff you do in the islands are minigames and going through small obstacles courses and gauntlets to get the tokens.
AND that's not counting the whole thing of collecting Koroks or Seeds of Power/Shield, which are a MUST-HAVE for late game because of stat leveling up.
What else...
The story is pretty good actually!
It's not great, it can be a bit confusing but you can tell that a major aspect of Frontier's development was having a good story and making sure the characters include themselves in it properly.
They could have done a lot more with some characters like Sage though, but everybody was included well and properly in the story.
Also, the game has a darker tone to it towards the ending, if you're a fan of that.
Now, more specifically about bosses and enemies...
When it comes to just enemies, a lot of them are gimmicky or have some moves that can be annoying to fight against, but they aren't bad adversaries at all, for the most part.
Some of them actually demand you to use the skills you learned as the only way to counter them and others don't open much chances for you to strike so you need to do what Sonic does best and hit them hard and fast for less trouble.
Some of them are glorified minigames that give you access to the part that damages the boss if hit.

Now, the bosses?
Yeah hmm they're amazing, I got nothing bad to say.
Nothing at all.
The OST is marvelous, fighting them feels great and they're a major highlight of the game, but I'd be lying if I said that they too aren't hit by Sonic's problem of stat leveling up making some moves VERY OP.

Now, the world itself...
It's funky
It's definitely NOT an empty world, it's jam-packed with enemy encounters, the aforementioned gauntlets and obstacles courses and each island feels unique due to their environemnt, world storytelling in the form of crashed Eggman ships, destroyed homes, hell, even the characters themselves constantly comment on the world theorizing what happened to it.
Overall, the world feels great to run around and explore and since you're, well, fast as ♥♥♥♥, it isn't hard to go from point A to B in a matter of seconds, maybe a minute at most.
But like I said before, most of what you'll be doing are the gauntlets, map-unlocking minigames and the occasional mini-boss because you NEED to defeat them to get access to a lot of the cyberspace levels.
The island have the size, just not that much variety when it comes to what you can do.
But it isn't bad, it's still a pretty fun experience to just explore.

And, as a finishing line
Frontiers makes it CLEAR that every adventure before Frontiers happened (except 06) through countless references and character dialogues.
Some people say it's ""forced"" but I disagree.
Sure, you can say that they exaggerated a bit on the references, that's a fair point.
But they weren't annoyingly present either, they were normally brought up in relevant contexts.
It feels more like ""Hey X, you know what this reminds me of? That one time this happened or that guy appeared, cool uh?""
It's a single line of dialogue at best.
It definitely isn't ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ YOU GUYS REMEMBER THIS RIGHT? IT EXISTED! ARE YOU FANS HAPPY THAT WE BROUGHT IT UP AND MENTIONED AND PRAISED IT FOR A FULL MINUTE?""
It just feels naturally and not forced.
but like, if you aren't a Sonic fan, you won't understand ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but I believe that these references also spice up the curiosity of a Non-Sonic Fan to try out the previous installments of Sonic's history and the calm and natural way they do it definitely doesn't strike a bad chord with me.
Frontiers seeks to tie in every past Sonic game to Frontiers and letting everyone know that as much as every other game felt separate from each other, they were still part of the same timeline of events.
So, if you had your doubts about Sonic Colors and Sonic Unleashed taking place in the same timeline or universe, there you go, Frontiers proves they do indeed take place in the same timeline and universe.
The references also feel a lot like to ""All of our adventures built up to this game""

Now...
Should you buy it for full 60 bucks?
Idk, you do you, but 60 bucks is too much for a game that feels a lot like an experiment or a proof of concept for a new sonic formula.
I mean, I personally LOVE how Sonic Team is trying to branch out and add more and more to Sonic's gameplay, but don't go into this expecting a refined experience.
Try to get it on sale
Also, if I were you, I'd seek to mod a lot of things I've mentioned in this review, like some combat aspects and the physics themselves, the base vanilla game has a lot of flaws that some mods were able to either completely eliminate or make more tolerable.",,
"Game is amazing, pretty and inovative, also with amazing original soundtrack. I reccomend it.",,

"This was easily the most anticipated game of 2022 for me. Was worried this was going to flop based on the early demos and teasers that IGN dropped back in June of that year, but my concerns were quickly alleviated when those demos started showing the combat mechanics. Then my initial impressions changed from deep concern to genuine intrigue. Now this game had something to offer that past Sonic games didn't have, and I wanted to invest in that for better or worse.

I'm now writing this review 4 months after the game's release and after logging 66 hours of playtime into this game, and I have to say that this game is actually pretty good!... just a bit under-cooked.

This game did a massive number of things surprisingly well. The first was the way it incorporated combat into Sonic's high-speed platforming. The result we got was a game that played a lot like an action-JRPG game like Nier: Automata, except compared to Nier I think this game has better combat combat mechanics and much better platforming. As a matter of fact, I had actually picked Nier back up some months before Frontiers's release because I made that connection while everyone else was comparing Frontiers to Breath of the Wild, and as much as I enjoyed the action and spectacle in Nier my attacks in that game felt random and not really deliberate because your inputs were limited to spamming light and heavy attacks. Here in Sonic Frontiers, the attacks actually have variety and plenty of moves that require specific inputs in order to execute them, which you can use in just about any order that want. This gives you the option to engage the enemies and bosses of this game in a very personalized way. You can dive right in with the homing attack, follow up with some light combos, dodge-roll or parry in response to an enemy's attack, follow that up with your choice of heavy attacks, bait enemies into groups so you can lasso them up together with the Cyloop ability, and then follow up with some heavy attacks that are bigger and can hurt multiple enemies at once.

Speaking of the Cyloop ability, this is handsdown the best new ability in Sonic's arsenal in a long time. Hold down the 'Y' button to activate a trail that follows Sonic, and if you loop with it everything in that loop gets blown skywards from enemies to guardians to even the titans themselves. The fact that it's a manual input ability allows you to use it in very creative ways, and it's key for solving puzzles as well as regenerating rings in the middle of a fight (almost like casting a Heal spell on yourself). And if you get access to the Quick Cyloop ability you can press 'Y' to add a mini cyloop to your combo to single out enemies and send them upwards, combo them in the air, and then slam them back into the ground with a second Quick Cyloop performed while midair (try it on bosses, too!).

Okay, I've spent a good chunk of the review gushing on about the combat, so I'll speed through the rest of the game's great qualities:
1) Sonic's high speed and tight controls make exploring the open zone fun.
2) Enemies and bosses in this game are a lot smarter and come in much larger variety.
3) Simple challenges and obstacle courses scattered throughout the zones to keep you engaged.
4) Training rooms are made available to players during most loading sessions, giving you opportunities to improve your skills in the game.
5) Has decent writing, great voice acting, and a story that manages to develop the characters and expand and somewhat unify the lore and continuity of the Sonic universe.
6) A fishing mini-game that's actually fun.
7) Great music score.
8) (And lastly) the RAWEST AND NUTTIEST Super Sonic boss fights this franchise has ever produced!!! (I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH!!!)

Alright, with that out of the way, here are some of the game's major weak points:

The first one that I need to elaborate on is the way the game presents its story. It tells a good story, but the story is told more through the narrative and not enough through the visuals. A lot of Sonic's journey in this game involves jumping in and out of this alternate dimension called ""Cyberspace."" It's explained to us that beings who enter Cyberspace have their memories of past environments projected onto the world around them in fragments, but we only see distorted versions of 3 of Sonic's most iconic levels such as Green Hill, Chemical Plant, and Sky Sanctuary. Not only are those themes overused in Sonic games at each point, it doesn't feel very convincing since we don't see fragments of other zones long-time Sonic fans are more than familiar with.

Speaking of Cyberspace, levels are built within Cyberspace that incorporate a more watered-down version of the boost-gameplay that could've used some more fine tuning. It can be off-putting to players who don't have the patience to learn and understand the controls, and while they're not completely mandatory they're still a big part of the game; the gears you obtain from defeating Guardians unlock gates into Cyberspace, the keys that you obtain from completing objectives in Cyberspace are used to unlock chaos emeralds, and the emeralds are used to turn into Super Sonic, defeat the Titans, and fly off to the next island. What makes the cyberspace portion optional is you can obtain those keys in the open zone at random by fighting enemies or by participating in the fishing mini-game so you can purchase them as prizes. It's great that avoiding Cyberspace doesn't halt your progression in the game, but it does slow it down considerably and significantly lowers the value of the game.

On top of that, Frontiers not-so-stellar qualities include
1) Unpolished stat system
2) A few mini-games that might frustrate players
3) A parry mechanic that's so overpowered it borderlines game-breaking
4) Open-zones that feel kinda empty
5) (And worst of all) a lackluster final boss

Yeah, I think that about covers all my major gripes with the game.

But you wanna know what's crazy about this game? Despite how unpolished it is, it still managed to be one of my most played Sonic games of all time. I mean, I have 66 hours on this game. Other more polished Sonic games don't even come close. How is this possible? The answer is Super Sonic.

The Super Sonic boss battles are hands down the best part of the game and the best any Sonic game. This is especially so if you're as invested in the game's combat system as I am, and I think I made it pretty clear that I loved the game's combat system. You know how in past Sonic games all you did as Super Sonic was run head first into the boss's vulnerable spots like the eyes? Well some genius from Sonic Team must've thought one day, ""Hey, what if Super Sonic just beat the living **** out of his foes instead, a la Super Saiyan Goku style?"" and that's basically Super Sonic in this game: No weakspots to target, few quick time events, full-on smack down.

See, the great thing about Sonic's combat system in this game is that you spend the majority of the base game mastering it as regular Sonic so you can apply that same combat as Super Sonic, where your abilities are JACKED and AMPED up in both visual and spectacle. Not to mention the background music during these fights really get your blood pumping with some energetic heavy-metal tracks featuring vocals from Kellin Quinn, lead singer of Sleeping with Sirens. This experience alone, from the build-up to the pay-off, is the game's best selling point, and as far as I'm aware it's COMPLETELY UNIQUE to this game.

Anyways, I've said everything I can say about this game. The free DLC content coming later this year sounds very promising too. Can't wait to play it.

So yeah, to summarize it all, even though this game is unpolished, the good that it offers is too unique and incredible to ignore. It's set a new bar for the series, and I hope more Sonic games build on top of what Frontiers has established.",,
"I love this game and can gladly recommend it. What else is there?

Oh, right. The game was rushed out the door, and is kinda lacking in polish in some areas, but once you adjust to the jank, you'll love it, I promise.",,
It's like a fangame (Compliment),,
"I,as a gamer from the late 70s have seen it all. I was not expecting much from Frontiers. I was pleasantly surprised. It's a fantastic video game. It's exploration, it's fun, it's got alot to do. It has mystery,charm and character. You are given the tools, go and enjoy at your will. Combat is good, traversal is amazing and feels great. Music is superb and visually it's unique and has a charm of its own. It's a little gem if a game and another reason why games designed in Japan keep gaming alive. It brings back fun and gaming should be fun.",,
"I'm rating it positive overall but keep in mind that this is barely. Part of me kinda just wants to rate it thumbs down purely due to how high the ratio is right now, which is misleading and dull. Sonic Frontiers is what sonic fans have been craving for years now, including me, but that's caused people to severely overrate it. Now I'll tell you the game is just fine, it's like a strong 6-7/10. But instead of going on for ages about everything in a review most won't bother reading fully, I'll just do the classical pros and cons, so here we go;

Pros:

+The OST slaps, throughout the years this is the one thing they've never failed at, they always get this right and thank god
+Most of the levels in the game (emphasis on most) are actually really fun, probably one of the best parts of the game
+The Titans you fight are some very badass fights allthough a bit dodgy on the gameplay side
+Game does a lot of experimenting, tries new things and though it doesn't always work, I think it still makes for an interesting experience, feels a bit newer
+100%-ing the game is actually not that bad either, you can do it in one playthrough which is great!
+You run fast
+Tails is cute as heck
+You don't need to collect every single memory thing which I'm so grateful for lol

And now for the cons baby;

-It's buggy as ♥♥♥♥, and sometimes it can get insanely annoying, especially when it keeps forcing camera movement and 2D, it messes up constantly and it's insanely annoying
-Makes no sense how sonic just forgets to run in 3D sometimes even in the open world
-Level 1-2 S rank, if you know you know
-It's really ugly, things don't spawn in until they're 10 metres before you, and the open world in general is just very unpleasing a lot of the time.
-Sub neg for this but the floating rails everywhere is so hilariously bad and I find it so funny how someone designed this and gave it a thumbs up
-Optimization is disappointing
-The price is bs for a game that copy and pastes so much and clearly looks super budget
-The story is forgettable
-For some reason sprites just look like they move in like 15 fps during some animations, the main cutscenes this isn't the case but for example boss animations and certain other things whenever they enforce minicutscenes, just looks really weird
-All the stages just reuse the sprites from generations basically, you got green hill-like levels, and chemical plant, and sky sanctuary, and speed highway... like... come on, you already did that multiple times, how budget are you guys when you can't be asked to make the levels more unique?


That's all I got really. I'm basically suuuper on edge on recommending it. If you're a long-term sonic fan who's played tons of the older games, including suffering through newer times, then this might just be that fresh new experience you need to gain a little bit of hope again for this. If you're not though, then this game is really mid and you should weigh your reasons to get it more on your own.

ALSO THIS IS RECOMMENDED ON THE BASIS AND ASSUMPTION THAT YOU BUY IT ON SALE. DO NOT BUY FOR FULL PRICE THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH THE SAME PRICE TAG AS ELDEN RING IT'S ACTUALLY RIDICULOUS OF THEM TO DO THAT",,
this sonic game so good without some ♥♥♥♥♥ telling you it's trash,,
Is good. Is very good.,,
final boss being the easiest boss ever (one button),,
3rd update truly is peak fiction,,
best game blue rat good,,
"After the jukebox addition, this is really amazing and fun to me",,
its only fun with mods,,
"They somehow made a janky AA Sonic game that's actually really fun and that I could recommend to almost anyone. The amount of content support this game had post-launch was also amazing and really did transform this game from what I considered a 7/10 at launch to a 8.5/10. While not perfect by any means, from release until now I've put well over 110+ hours into a game that I really thought I wouldn't touch again after 100%ing within like 3-4 days at launch. I'd say it's well worth a shot if you're even slightly interested in it.",,
"I would like to say that the final update really shows us the mighty power of our lord and savior sonic the hedgehog. Sonic team did a good job with the past dlc, even if dlc 3 was a booty destroying experience on my end, I truly do believe that this was our sonic colors.

8/10 needs more fishing levels please <3",,
"Love the soundtrack on this one. Probably the best compilation of electronic and drum and bass in a video game that i've ever heard (everhood?). Gameplay is unique, the open world is great to explore and you can progressively upgrade sonic over time, even has a jukebox for old soundtracks. Get it for the music alone lol",,
7/10,,
No chili dogs but still good,,
"Sonic Frontiers is an upcoming game that promises to take players on a high-speed adventure through various zones and environments. However, one major issue with this game is the unrealistic portrayal of hedgehogs running at supersonic speeds. This depiction goes against what is known about the biology and behavior of hedgehogs in real life.

Hedgehogs are small, nocturnal mammals that are known for their slow and steady movements. They are not capable of running at supersonic speeds or performing the outrageous stunts and maneuvers depicted in Sonic Frontiers. This lack of realism takes away from the game's immersion and makes it difficult for players to connect with the game's mechanics on a believable level.

Furthermore, the game's insistence on portraying hedgehogs as super-fast runners could also be seen as potentially harmful to the perception and treatment of real-life hedgehogs. By presenting an unrealistic and exaggerated image of hedgehogs, the game could perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misconceptions about these animals.

In conclusion, Sonic Frontiers' unrealistic portrayal of hedgehogs running at supersonic speeds is a major flaw that detracts from the game's immersion and believability. By going against what is known about hedgehogs in real life, the game presents an exaggerated and potentially harmful image of these animals. If you're someone who values realism and accuracy in games, then Sonic Frontiers is not the game for you.",,
Time to find your flame and break through it all cause you're undefeatable - Confucius or someone idk,,
"A really great Sonic game!

Just a few things that I noted could have been better in the game, but otherwise, nothing much to complain about this game!",,
"I gotta be honest with you, i havent expected this game to be that good....
Sonic frontiers is SEGA's first attempt of fully transitioning the blue blur into a proper open world, a change various fans of the franchise (me included) doubted if it will even work, the recent sonic games which were more liniar were plauged with sluggish movement which only added to my concern.

When the first gameplay trailer was dropped i wasnt very impressed, the gameplay seemed empty, the map generic and the objectives didnt make a lot of sense at the beginning, lets just say that we can all agree that our first impressions werent all that great at the start.

I decided to wait for a sale, thought it would be the smartest thing to do since i myself didnt quite enjoy the sluggish movement of 3D sonic games in the past, once it got on sale i decided to finally give it a try, and oh my... it completely blew me away.

Sonic frontiers is a great open world game which added aspects that were never seen before in the franchise as well as old school mechanics we all love from previous sonic games.

But enough about the gameplay, lets talk about the story, the story of sonic frontiers was a bit confusing at the start (which was obviously the point), i wasnt sure what was sonic's business in the island he was now trapped in but as the story progressed i was delighted by the superb writing, the dialog and engaging aspect of exploring the world as you try and free your friends and face your greatst challenge yet.

Lets now talk about the music, the music is absolute fire, every track of the game is amazing and adds a lot of flavour to the environment, my personal favorites were the titan tracks.

However, sonic frontiers is not without its flaws, despite me enjoying the free roaming aspect of the game, as a fan of open worlds games i was expecting more stuff to do, more intaractions between characters or perhaps have more side missions scattered around the map.

Another thing worth mentioning are the repetitivity of the game, even if im quite used to this type of games i was expecting sonic to try and innovate in some aspects of it, what i mean by this is of course introducing different objectives via every biome instead of making you collect the same stuff over and over again and maybe include other levels from sonic's past in cyberspaces.

In conclusion, Sonic frontiers was an overall succesful experiment, SEGA has finally managed to make an innovative game for sonic for once, i hope SEGA will make another open world game similar to this, this time with larger maps, more side missions and an even better story to tell.",,
who the ♥♥♥♥ at sega decided to release a game that goes this hard,,
Fun! I think many people with ADHD might find this game extremely satisfying!,,
Sonic hedgeh,,
"Pretty good. Some of the bosses, specifically Asura seem a little unfinished. The characters movements are sometimes robotic and feel a little less expressive. The biggest issue I have with the game is that denuvo is used. It makes the game feel sluggish at points even with a high-end PC. The game would be more playable and better if you dropped denuvo entirely. If you have a PS5 or Xbox Series X, I highly recommend you play it on those consoles instead. If not, wait for this game to go on sale and then buy it.",,
"fun
can go fast",,
♥♥♥♥ all the critics. Unironically the best 3D Sonic game since Adventure 1 and 2.,,
peak sonic,,
Can't wait for Sonic Frontiers 2,,
Fun,,
"sAnic Fast. Now just add Shadow instead of the mod and we good.

So far story is alright.
Gameplay is smooth and fast obv
mods help sort out the tiny issue you may have with the game (graphics settings included)
Objectives feel grindy at times.",,
"It's a lot of fun tbh

EDIT @ 25 hours: Okay, now that I'm finished, I loved this game a LOT. the Super Sonic boss fights are stellar, the movement system is addictive, and the skill tree is-- while simple-- fun to experiment with.

There are some parts of the middle to the end of the game that I didn't personally enjoy because of restricting mechanics, but this is a solid foundation to a game franchise that has been looking to do something new for a long time. I hope they build off of this, there's really something here.",,
"this is the most fun I've had in a sonic game ngl. It feels like an edgy 2010s amv with metal gear rising comboed with devil may cry in boss fights and like a supersonic (pun intended) speed mario odyssey breath of the wild in the open world segments. Characterisation and plot are much better than recent games too although my only criticism is the slightly wonky cyberspace physics, lack of proper momentum and but apart from that it's about as perfect as you could expect from a sonic game

tldr; get it, it's worth it


edit after third dlc: the spindash makes the cyberspace stages feel almost as fast as unleashed, albeit a lot shorter. the dlc stages are so good they make all the others feel unfinished, and the new final boss is incredible, although the towers and perfect parry timings are worse than dark souls in places.

frontiers IS incredible but now sonic team's had the opportunity to learn from it i can't wait to see what comes next. as adventure had its adventure 2, i hope frontiers' legacy is just as fun",,
"Such a fun game from beginning to end. The music is absolutely amazing and I love the return of the serious tone in the characters and the story. There are a few bugs but nothing game breaking, just little annoyances. I would say that the only big disappointment in this game was the final boss. Too quick and easy. Felt like it was lacking a lot and the ""secret final boss"" was worse. Other than that, pretty damn fun game. (I also loved fishing in this game. Wish there was more to catch. GIVE US CHAO GARDENS!)",,
"This game is just Sonic Adventure with modern boost and epic dragon ball fighting style. It was an amazing experience to play it. Cyber Space levels were really fun and i also loved how they designed open world. It surprisingly doesn't feel empty because of fun riddles, mini boss fights and cool platforming areas. It delivers the feeling that you really are sonic and you have that freedom feeling while running around as you want.

Finally, i think this game will have best soundtrack award because i can't stop listening its music. They say sonic goes hard with music and yes that's frickin right...",,
"I played this on PS5 using 60fps mode (my pc is trash)

Certainly not the best game in the market, but it has the expected banger soundtrack, a surprisingly well thought out open zone format, and made the combat much more interesting than just spamming homing attack or boost.

The arcade mode after beating the game should feature a boss rush and hard mode similar to the Kirby arenas. Another complaint is what happened to the character controller in cyber space? I hope to see use of the 4th island in DLC as I'm confused why the devs went through all that work just for 30 minutes of content.

Despite the lack of boss rush and decent cyberspace control. I found the game to take the right step forward and hope the formula and character controller is improved in a future installment.",,

So far I've had alot of fun running around playing this game. Really killer soundtrack and interesting mechanics. Storyline is weird but I don't hate it so far.,,
"Best Sonic game in a long time. Amazing soundtrack.
Only cons are that the ending sucks hard and it's seemingly optimised rather poorly.
Still well worth playing though.",,
the game is AMAZING! its the best sonic has been in ages! i hope sonic team/sega take what worked in this game and makes the next game even better!,,
Wow! A really fun freaking game with a great soundtrack.,,
Jank as hell but a really fun time :). Sets up a great new era of Sonic games!!!,,
"I had so much fun running around and jumping all over the place with these different maps. The boss fights were fast paced and also very enticing. Story was there and it was fine, I just had fun being a completionist and getting everything to 100%. Overall, a good step forward for sonic games but now I'm hoping for an individual Tails game, Sega please make it happen.",,
"Well at long last SEGA have managed to make a good Sonic game again.

Going for an open-world approach Sonic Frontiers is on the surface a different beast to previous titles but maintains many core aspects from before. One of the most crucial aspects when designing an open world game is making the movement and navigation fun for the player, this is something that Sonic Frontiers excels at, and moving across the five islands never feels like a chore.

Maps are populated by what are essentially little obstacle courses, which the player can manoeuvre through to collect an item or progress to another part of the island. Collecting is the bread and butter of the game, gears to unlock Cyberspace stages (essentially recycled 3D stages from Sonic Generations - though these can be circumvented by playing a fishing mini game if you have a complete aversion to the boost formula), keys from said stages to collect Chaos Emeralds, and character tokens to progress the story and to find out more about the island.

Movement is based on the previous boost formula but can be adjusted in the menu to suit your needs, though I found the default to work fine for me. Moving into an 'obstacle course' generally locks your movement into a single plane to help prevent you from speeding off (though you are able to get away if you want to in most cases), and the courses are normally made up of rails and platforming stages. If you've played previous 3D Sonic titles nothing here should be too radical. Honestly though most of the fun had is just zooming through the stages and taking in the scenery.

Combat is more involved than previous Sonic games and you can unlock combo moves through collecting tokens. Combat is actually pretty decent and makes a nice change of pace but like the obstacles you can easily avoid or run away from enemies if they're giving you a hard time.

The story has been praised by a lot of people and honestly it's pretty decent, there's certainly a big emphasis on mystery which I appreciate. There are a few bits that are meant to be taken seriously that come across as somewhat farcical though I'm sure a kid would enjoy it, and the writer *really* likes putting in references to previous games as if to make up for the lack of serious continuity in other Sonic titles. Unfortunately it's done to the point of distraction and in most cases the reference could easily be replaced by a more eloquent description or dialogue, rather than 'This thing is just like the time when we did that thing'. Overall it's nothing to write home about but it's not awful either, really it's just competent though it does do some things that make me roll my eyes that I won't go into due to spoilers.

Onto the bad then:
Denuvo is rubbish, please stop using it SEGA.
When you upgrade your speed and ring count with the Koco Elder you keep having to go through the same dialogue prompt over and over again. Which if you have a lot of Koco's with you means you'll literally spend minutes upgrading your stats. Conversely when upgrading your combat abilities with the Koco Hermit he'll do it right away. There really needs to be an option to upgrade your speed or ring count to the maximum you can go with the Kocos you have on you.
The cyberspace stages can feel really sluggish even when boosting which frankly feels absurd when you compare them to Generations and Unleashed where your eyeballs were in danger of melting. It feels like they course corrected far too much in the opposite direction.
Wall running can be a bit tricky but this might just be the way I've set up the control.
The game overall is perhaps a bit too easy, but that again is a relative thing.
The final boss is... well you'll see but it's dumb, bosses overall in this game a real step up from previous titles but the last one is a complete curveball.

Overall, I rate it a 7.5/10",,
the game is fun,,
"chief, this is it",,
fun,,
"There's some slight spoilers (and a major one) in this review.

This is the best 3D sonic game since generations imo, the open world feels natural for a sonic game and the cyberspace levels give players a familiar experience.

The music is great and the story is much better than the one in forces and i think Ian did a great job with it, it also confirms the ""canonity"" of the previous games with occasional references to the older titles (even boom at some point!) and i'm happy that it's finally been cleared up now.

I feel like this is a massive leap in the right direction for sonic's future in gaming, especially if they keep Ian as a writer since he connected all the games together and fixed some of the weird issues with the canon. It also gives me hope for a proper tails spin-off in the future thanks to a voice line from tails :)

The game does have its flaws however, some enemies (although its only like 2 or 3) lock you into combat with no way out which can be very annoying when you're trying to run from point A to point B, another enemy locks the camera onto it, which wouldn't be a problem if it was in a linear game, but when you're running around it can get you to run off of a cliff or bump into a wall and just slows things down overall.

There's only 4 themes for all the cyberspace levels, so even though the layout is different for each level, you'll be seeing the same 4 themes. I've also noticed that alot of cyberspace levels reuse layouts from previous games like generations, which isn't necessarily a problem (and has a lore reason i guess) but it can seem lazy to some.

The physics aren't bad, but they're definitely not perfect, sometimes it feels like sonic should be able to jump a bit higher (but its probably just me) and there's a massive slowdown when you jump whilst running, which can be useful at some parts, but is just annoying in general. Another thing is that on one of the islands in the game there's a bridge that you'll have to lower by progressing through the story, this can be easily jumped if done right, but you're blocked by an invisible wall until completing the mission that lowers it, in which you basically jump over it as well.

These things didn't bother me too much however as the main gameplay was alot of fun and i enjoyed pretty much everything of it, although there's only one part that i really felt was off, which is the final bossfight. While the second last bossfight had an unclear end condition, the final boss switches the gameplay up to one of the minigames from previous main missions, this goes on for quite a while and isn't exactly easy (for most people atleast) and at the end you have to do 3 ""skill checks"" to end the fight, failing at any point in the bossfight puts you back at the beginning which just gets tedious at some point. This was the only time where i genuinely didn't really enjoy it for the most part because its quite long and failing at the end makes you go back to the start of the bossfight.

Regardless of the things i disliked about the game, i had alot of fun playing it and i think its great for what it is!",,
"(I had to cut this review down a bit because it was too long to post why do I care about this stupid blue rodent so much)
Story/Writing: 8/10.
Where they make up in a decent overarching story is the phenomenal character writing that makes these characters feel REAL. Sonic isn't just a ♥♥♥♥, tails isn't just smart, amy isn't just girl, knuckles isn't just dumb.
Sonic is still snarky, but he cares for his friends, he's upbeat, he's honestly also just funny. Amy is a caring soul filled with love for everything, wanting to just see love bloom for others. Knuckles is stoic, a true warrior, last of the echidnas and honorable enough to lead his own army to get out of his cyber cage. Tails is growing up, he doubts himself, he wants to be more all because of his strong bond with his best friend.
Eggman has my favorite glowup. I've hated how eggman started to get portrayed in the games, he wasn't the evil genius he was supposed to be, he was dumbed down, and made the butt of a joke because you knew he was supposed to lose at the end. But in frontiers, he has his wits, intellect, and a perfect touch of his arrogant self we're used to. His brains shine here and prove that Dr. Robotnik is more than just an inventor, he's a mastermind (I recommend reading through all the egg memos you get from the fishing shop, they provide excellent lore, have eggman speaking in a reserved tone all voice beautifully by the great Mike Pollock, and show Eggman's true colors as not just a villain, but as a person.)

Voice acting: 9/10.
Everyone did so good, this is the best Roger has sounded as sonic and honestly might be my favorite deliveries and writing for sonic yet. Amy could've used work, but everyone else did a fantastic job. The voice direction, despite being odd at first, was really easy for me to warm up to and I adored every single character interaction in the game, with the sonic and knuckles interactions being a personal highlight.

Music: 10/10.
It's sonic music. It's always great. The music always fits the tone of whats going on. The tranquil and calm music of the overworld (And the fishing theme, which is my favorite song), the upbeat EDM and dubstep of cyberspace levels, and the insanely hard metal for the super sonic themes. All of them shine in their own way and I had the game cranked up to max the entire playthrough.

Gameplay (Open World): 6/10.
While sonic himself controls amazingly, some of the decisions with the cyloop, rings, and collectibles confused me, as well as combat being iffy at times. Sonic feels smooth, he stops on a dime which is exactly what you need in an open world game, no sliding, precision is key and it's found here.
However the actual design of the open worlds, while amazing to run around in, felt like a lot of it was just thrown in there. I would've liked more challenges or actual terrain objectives instead of just floating platforms and grind rails, It would've been amazing to run up a giant pillar in a short amount of time, or run along the ceiling and walls of a cave to go through a bunch of rings in a few seconds or something, but every ""World Challenge"" felt very samey. The cyloop, while fun, had little to no depth despite how much it was used. It was always just ""Make a circle here, congrats challenge completed"". It also confuses me with how many rings were put in the overworld, with the cyloop granting you an infinite amount of rings for just running in circles, it felt odd for any rings to be in the overworld at all, as there never really was a moment where I wasn't at max rings from just running in circles. Collectibles like the lost kocos kinda felt like they were just scattered and thrown about, with there being no reason to collect them or any other collectibles due to the cyloop and fishing minigame giving you everything you would ever need. The open worlds were beautiful and fun to run around in, but lacked depth.
Combat as well also felt very shallow. You can get through any encounter by mashing and then just doing a cyloop or pressing parry when you need to. Some combat also felt buggy, while overall it felt nice, snappy, and responsive, the fact that they mapped every special move to only 3 button combinations made it so I would constantly be using the wrong moves just because I tapped R2 once.

Gameplay (Cyberspace): 8/10.
All of the original levels, if I can even call them that, felt more like missions or challenges that you would find in previous sonic games, where they cut out a small portion of a level. But the ones that are just flatout taken from past games, despite being nothing new, still feel like gold and that's due to the new way sonic feels in frontiers.
Sonic is much slower in cyberspace, which is felt way more in the 2d sections, however I'm all for this. Boosting is now on an infinite and regenerating meter, but as a trade-off, it's much slower and no longer makes sonic blast through enemies. It's no longer a boost and is now more like a dash, but this feels much better than the uncontrollable speeds he could reach with the boost from unleashed, generations, and forces. The game feels like a proper platformer now. The magnet dash is a great new technique as well, which can send you flying through levels at immense speed, with the risk of you accidentally hitting an enemy, spikes, or falling off the level entirely if you aren't careful.
Despite some of the length of the levels, some of them can be incredibly challenging. One level took me 40 minutes to beat, but by the end of it, I felt proud of being able to achieve a time that was over a full minute better than the S rank requirements. However the opposite is also true, with some levels being far too easy, short, and were trivial to achieve an S rank.
Cyberspace was hit or miss. Old levels felt amazing all the way from SA2 to Generations re-treads. New levels could also be fun, but could feel hollow.

Visuals: 5/10
I was very disappointed with how the overworld looked. The environments looked great, but pop-in was far too distracting, with platforms just appearing out of thin air no matter how close or far away you are from them.
In cyberspace, while pop-in is no issue, each level was only 1 of 4 possible styles. A green hill zone style, sky sanctuary style, City style like in radical highway or speed highway, and a Chemical Plant style. Sometimes they would have a slight orange filter, signifying the evening, but they still all felt identical. This is especially a problem in the post-game arcade mode level select, in which you can play each level freely, however these levels are merely given ""1-1"" type names, and all look the same from the previews, meaning you have to look through levels, sometimes entering and leaving levels just to confirm whether or not it was the right one. Not a single cyberspace level was visually pleasing or interesting.
The character models are the best part of the visuals. Sonic looks so expressive, and while the lip sync isn't amazing, I can forgive that due to the faces of each characters being able to show much more emotion than before. Sonic has the emotion that he hasn't been able to show in-game and was only ever seen in artwork and the comics.

Summary:
Any sonic fan will adore this game. It's fun, charming, engaging, and a real damn treat, after these past few dull years of 3d sonic. Is it better than mania? I can't say,the games are too different to compare. This really felt like it's own product rather than just ""We're trying to do generations again but failed"" (cough cough Sonic Forces). Highly recommended to anyone familiar with sonic up to this point, especially someone with lore knowledge as the cutscenes were really rewarding to those who care about the story of this little blue rodent. As a starting point? While I'll still recommend it, I believe it doesn't serve as a good introduction to the series, as it relies far too heavily on old references, level design, and knowledge of how old boost games played.",,
"Product received for free

So uh- this game is a sonic game

It's combat is fun and the voice acting is okay in my opinion.

A few issues is that sonic doesn't feel as fast even far into the game. The animations are not awesome, the keybinds are odd, and it was probably made for controller.

I would suggest it yeah it's fun just

somewhat frustrating at times",,
"I can't believe I'm saying this, honestly I can't, but Sonic is genuinely back. Is the game perfect? certainly not, it's not without it's issues. But this is easily the best attempt at a good 3D formula for Sonic yet, and definitely the best sonic game in the past 20 years (barring Mania).

Sonic Team, listen to us, you have a really good thing going, keep refining this formula, make it better and improve it. Don't throw it out like you usually do

9/10 I can proudly say

PS: OST is fantastic. Should've been nominated for game awards",,
"It's very nice to play a new Sonic game in the year 2022 and genuinely enjoy myself. I've been very critical of some of the recent Sonic games that Sega has put out, but this one feels like a true and proper step into the right direction. It's not perfect, but it's a game that very clearly had a lot of time and love put into it. Definitely a win for Sonic Team.",,
"I went into this game quite skeptical coming off of Sonic Forces, but I was pleasantly surprised. This is a great step in the right direction for the series. It could use some more work. I thought the controls in cyberspace were kinda sluggish for example, some of the open world elements felt random, some of the mini bosses were a little glitchy, and the game could have used more polish generally. However, as a whole, this game is incredibly fun. Exploring the open zones and flying across the map at insane speeds is really exhilarating. The super sonic battles were also a major highlight that I did not see coming. I also appreciate the noticeable improvement in how the dialogue is written and how the characters are animated during cutscenes compared to earlier titles. The combat elements, while simple, also add variety to the experience. I hope SEGA continues with this approach for future games and further refines the controls and gameplay.",,
"The OST Is God-Like

The game itself is like whiplash where you go between having incredible fun and frustration at the idea that this game could be better.

The game play is super fun, but the level design leaves a lot to be desired.

The boss fights are increidble spectacle fights that get the blood pumping

You really feel like Sonic in this game going really fast doing all these cool battle mechanics that feel fluid, and then it's bogged down by how the world looks and feels.

I think I played Green Hill Zone 10 times, Angel Island 6 times, and Chemical Plant Zone about 7 times

I feel like I can't recommend buying this game at 60.00 even though I had a lot of genuine fun with it.",,

lets hope sega elaborates on this precious formula",,
"i am so happy to say this is an actual good game

it is by no means a perfect game, it has a lot of low points but when its good, its REALLY good",,
"Wow.... I did not expect how much I would love this game. From the moment I opened the application, I quickly began to fall in love with this game.

Some context for my review. I have 5.5 hours at the time of this review and I just finished the first are and have started exploring the 2nd

I've played almost entirely oh my Stab Deck. It's a great experience in the Deck but if you lock the game to 60 fps you will get a big where the lighting bugs out and flickers. Unfortunately the only way I've found to fix this is by locking it to 30 fps.
Here are my settings:
Shadow: low
Frame rate: 30
Aa: fxaa
Ambient occlusion: on
Local reflection: off
Bloom: low
Volumetric lighting: high
Render scale 100%
Resolution: 1280x720
I get a solid 30fps with this, and if switch to 60fps, I turn AO off and resolution scale to 75% and I get 40-50fps.
Despite having to be in 30fps, the game is quite enjoyable for me.

Lastly, I'm an OG Sonic fan. My first ever video game was Sonic 1 for the Sega Genesis and Sonic holds a special place for me. I played most Sonic games up until Sonic Heroes and then I stopped playing Sonic games until Frontiers. Also, I avoided the leaks and even the newest trailers.

Ok.... Now for the review. The first thing I noticed is the tone of the game is really interesting. It starts like a normal sonic game but immediately switches to this mellow almost peaceful atmosphere. And it's not just you the player who notices it, but so do Sonic and his friends. Something is off with the setting of the gang 6 and it's quite earie. The characters comment on this eariness too and it's like you're going through this mystery with them.

Thats the open world area. Then there's the cyberspace levels. And this is where the game goes back to being what expect from a sonic game. Linear levels with lots of turns, twists and loops. They're fun but most of the ones I've done felt too short. There's one that I really love because it reminds me of Sonic Adventure Battle 2. Some of these levels are like 30 seconds long and I just wish they were longer. However I'm only like 20% through the game so I don't know if this changes.

Back to the open world. A lot of people talk crap about how the open world is designed but they clearly only watched the game and haven't actually played it. The world is riddled with short performing sections and puzzles. Ready or varying difficulties. The cool thing is that you are sort of building this fast travel highway system the more you unlock the map. It's like you're building a grind railway system. And it's not just a straight rail from a to b. There are twists and loops and it's really fun to traverse.

I'm still figuring out the combat so I can't say much about it. But the cool thing is that the skill system gives you several options in your you want to fight so there is some variety. Also enemies are quite creative and are unique from I've another and require different strategies.

Boss fights are cool. Not going to say anything about them as you should experience it for yourself.

Anyway... I'll stop rambling.

I absolutely love this game. The only negative is the physics can be jank sometimes.

But ya who cares.... Go buy it. Like.... Now",,
Finally a W for 3D Sonic fans.,,
A real Dream Come True for a Sonic fan. I LOVE THIS GAME,,
Please let this be the foundation for Sonic Adventure 3 this game is Absolutely amazing!!!! Can’t wait for mods!,,
"I would gladly reccomend this game to other players. intrigiuing story, well rounded characters, and nearly seamless gameplay. my only complaint is you cant access options untill you do the cyloop? come ON Sega!

Other than that, I highly reccomend this game! its a bit pricey, ($61 at checkout. yeesh) but its well worth it.

Finally, as with all Sonic games, I love the overarching message of helping others regardless of reward and the underlying message of friendship!
Well worth it!",,
"A good first attempt at making an open world 3D sonic game. Combines good ideas from previous Sonic games and mash them into one. Normal sonic levels are here called ""Cyberspace levels"" and there are 30 of them, as many as there are in Sonic Forces. Merged into a 3D open world concept with 5 zones, along with Unleashed werehog style combat without the werehog. Large open zones give adequate exploration however this is where majority of the visual glitches and bugs occur. Water and lighting constantly has shadow and rendering issues, the part where night changes to day will result in a huge environment light change. Severe pop in for intractable objects makes it hard to impossible to see from a distance and forces the player to physically move closer to see if something is even there. This makes navigation a chore.
I also dislike how sonic controls in the cyberspace levels, especially his lack of control while in the air. It is difficult to steer Sonic when he gets air time and feel like the system is actively resisting my inputs which makes platforming in 3D sections frustrating. Hard to correct for a jump I overshot on while in the air if I miscalculated a jump.
Bad: Cyberspace physics and open zone visual glitches.
Good: Fun to ♥♥♥♥ around in the open zone, epic boss battles, cyberspace challenges, with sonic just being sonic.
Meh: Mediocre story as usual, boring puzzles and repetitive combat (for normal enemies)

6/10",,
"Copy and pasted my analysis of the game. Beware for spoilers if you're very early on, but all of the information is from the first island.

I don't know why certain critics are being so harsh on this game. Yeah, I know ""Cope"", But honestly? Every other sentence is a name drop of a previous sonic game, location or storyline, which is great because until now all of the world building had been completely abandoned. Every game was it's own, self contained adventure so, they may as well not have happened. I'm only 1/5 of the way through but I already know that the game is telling the story of the eradication of an ancient species who likely constructed the Chaos Emeralds, Angel Island, etc. Maybe even a lot of the magical artefacts in sonic world, such as rings. Questions people who care enough have had for a long time.

The nature of the game's story, it was decided that all of the characters should express themselves more proper and seriously, rather than happy-go-lucky. It's a massive debate within Sonic if the games even should try and tell serious stories, or be dumb goofy adventures. Obviously, I'm in the former group as my favourite is Sonic Adventure 2. The one where a young girl gets gunned down, along with a space station of scientists by the US military due to fears of immortality they requested be research, being used against them

The gameplay itself is... fun. People have complained that the world is empty, and I agree, but not only is it a plot point, it's also necessary for Sonic to function. For the most part, he handles far slower than any boost to win game, which I enjoy because I'm tired of boost to win, but you're rewarded for good play by Mega speed. Either way, if the points of interest were too close together, it'd be difficult to actually play as Sonic, and you'd do more jumping and climbing than running. The Island itself is very big so I can see the reason for the complaints, but after a few hours of exploration you unlock fast travel, and once again, if you play well enough your top speed is insane and it makes it so you can cross the island in 30 - 60 seconds. Again, let me stress that the island is huge. Sonic is just REALLY fast when you have a lot of rings.

Music is leaning more towards forces than any type of rock. I liked Forces music, and it's a nice change from remixes of classic levels which have already been done to death. It's a shock at first, but they're really quite catchy

I'm going to jump off now, but I cleared the first ""Zone"", and it ended with a face off between Super Sonic and a Titan. Super Sonic REALLY likes this formula, and it's super weird but pleasant to see him reoccurring, rather than the final showdown. Usually Super Sonic is a race against time where all you need to do is reach the boss, but considering this game's gameplay is combo-based combat, Super Sonic is essentially regular Sonic but on drugs. It's still a time trial, but between the first piece of rock in the game, button mashing, and doing combos, and quick time events to overpower the entire titan so you aren't flattened, my heart was racing and it's probably the most fun Super Sonic segment in all of Sonic.

I've heard a lot of complaints about the world being... not sonic enough, but after only a couple hours I can say with certainty that that's the entire point. The playable areas were the home of a civilisation that achieved godhood, immortality and more. The enemies aren't typical Sonic Robots, but the servitors of the most powerful beings in all of sonic. To be honest? Sonic is worried about his friends. He rightly conceded that he couldn't beat the titan without help from the chaos emeralds, and frankly he's getting his ass handed to him, and it's just great for the main character not to be a god in his own right. Imagine the hero of the story actually going through hardship

In conclusion, it isn't perfect. Pop in is a problem with many open world games, it can be considered too slow, too different, not interesting enough, too interesting. What we can deduce from this is that the internet has a hate boner for Sonic. Any person who enjoys Sonic and picks up this game will likely enjoy it a ton as it features close to classic gameplay, with new engaging combat, RPG elements, exploration and being able to go fast. Any person who's never played a Sonic game will likely hate it because it will be compared too closely to other platformers, whereas at this point Sonic is it's own genre. Shocker

TLDR: You can fish",,
"I've been playing the game since yesterday (release date) and honestly, I've been there since the start, when the IGN first showcase came out and I'm honestly impressed with how good it turned out, the story takes itself serious and knows when to lay a joke at the right time (Something i noticed the previous writers for like colors or frontiers where horrible at, no offense), the voice performance is amazing and gameplay wise, once you get used to the controls it's very addicting! I definitely recommend it if you're into sonic and also open world games.",,

"It's very fun to zip around in, I had a great time just messing around, it's immensely satisfying especially with how everything flows together. There's a lot of player freedom and with how much there is to do in terms of puzzles, platforming, and things to collect, you won't have a reason to be lost, in fact it's more likely that you will be side-tracked from the main objective quite often if you're prone to being distracted. This game is constantly moving, there is never a moment where you aren't running towards the next challenge and that allows for a fluidity of gameplay. Overall, this is definitely a great step in the right direction for the series and should be the groundwork standard going forward.",,
"Easily the best Sonic game to come out in ages. Ian Flynn as the main writer was a great step in the right direction, and not reusing/remixing legacy music for Cyberspace Stages is appreciated. I hope the next Sonic titles refines and expands the gameplay of Frontiers, this feels like a great direction for the series to go in",,

"jesus ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ christ a good sonic game WHAT


Now, an actual serious review after finishing the game, god this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing. Even with a few of its issues the game is really good, its an easily 8/10 or 9/10 if you're a starving sonic fan (most of us). God i just don't want to say anything about this game so i don't ruin the fun... just give it a try, you will start slow but by the time you're playing you'll be enjoying this so much and blasting at full speed you will even forget time is going by.

I was worried when i pre purchased this, i really thought i would regret especially since its a full priced game here on Brazil (Thanks, Sega.) but it was well worth the $60. I'm done with the game but i still have much to do in it so i'll definitely have around 30 hours by the time i 100% the game.",,
"A Diamond in the Rough

Sonic Frontiers is easily the best 3D Sonic I've played in ages. I honestly think this is the best 3D sonic since the Adventure games. Sonic controls brilliantly, and I only have a couple minor complaints about how he controls in the Open Zone. To say that this game is an improvement over Forces would be an understatement. Yes, it has flaws, but to dismiss this game because of those flaws would be a shame in my opinion.

I have no doubt that this will continue to be a polarizing game online, with several people insisting it's ""mid"" because of its art direction and lack of AAA polish. I actually like the art direction of this game, but there's definitely some techincal issues that hold this game back a bit. That being said, I still think it's a shame if you skip out on this game because of those reasons. They clearly put a priority on making a fun game above all else, and considering that I feel there's an obsession with polish over actual gameplay in the industry these days, I find that to be a breath of fresh air. That being said, I'm not trying to excuse the technical shortcomings here, I just don't think it ruins what is a very fun game at its core.

The way I'd describe this game in a nutshell is if a collectathon platformer had an orgy with BOTW, Evangelion, Shadow of the Colossus, Death Stranding, and Nier Automata. It's kind of amazing and I love it. It might not be what everyone wants from a Sonic game, but I honestly love this franchise for weird, experimental ♥♥♥♥, even if it doesn't work out. I think Sonic Team mostly succeeded this time though.

Combat is fairly simple and easy in difficulty, but the sheer variety of enemies in this game help keep the combat system fresh. And the , oh the bosses. These are a ton of fun and have some of the best boss themes you will ever hear in a game; I'm not exaggerating (the entire soundtrack is amazing). There's definitely some tweaks I'd make to the combat and stuff that I'd hope they will expand upon in future games, but I enjoy what's here. My main complaint is that I wish they would ditch rings and just go with a common health bar, as the cyloop can be easily abused to make combat even easier than it already is. I'm sure some tweaks can be made with mods in the future.

Mentioning mods, the modding potential for this game is insane. I can't wait to see the crazy ♥♥♥♥ that people come up with, and I might want to get involved with the scene itself.

Cyberspace is probably the worst part of the game, but it isn't even that bad to be honest. The stages are still more enjoyable than Forces (partially thanks to reusing stages from better sonic games), but the physics definitely suffer a bit, especially in the 2D stages. You'll still want to play these because each stage has a different song and I still think they're somewhat fun.

Overall, I actually really enjoy the structure of this game, and . There's a lot of potential and room to grow here, and I genuinely think that if Sonic Team is better staffed next time around, they might be able to make a truly outstanding Sonic game. That being said, considering that this game was only made by team of 60 people, the results are impressive. This game definitely has some jank in it, but it's a blast, and I don't think you should skip out on it if you're still on the fence about buying it.

If you want to play an atmospheric action platformer, I strongly recommend this game. I understand that the environments are not to everyone's liking and that this isn't Sonic Adventure 3: The Return of Mephiles with Open World Chao Gardens and multiple playable characters, but please give the game a chance. You may be pleasantly surprised. Also, the speedrunning potential for this game is insane.",,
"My impressions with this game started pretty bad on the beginning, and I wish I could give this game a mixed rating but sadly steam doesn´t have that feature so a negative seems closer. This is a spoiler free review.

The game isn´t actually bad, however it just takes some time to get used to the new open zone formula before you start finding it fun, specially for someone who is used to playing previous sonic games.

The game starts up being super slow, even when turning the initial speed setting all the way up. As you upgrade your speed and overcharge with rings it then actually becomes pretty fast, too bad it takes a long time to get there, it kinda threw me off a lot at the beginning, although it at least encouraged to use the drop-dash to get some speed downhill (yes momentum while moving is actually in the game, although a bit wonky).

Cyberspace levels are pretty meh, I also don´t like that for some reasons the controls and speed in cyberspace are different and independent from whenever you upgrade or not. This was probably the weakest part of the game since it feels like a super slow version of sonic colors levels and a lot of the level design seems to be too similar to previous games, sonic gens and unleashed to be precise.

The game isn´t really open world, its more of a Mario odyssey type of game where you are put in a big map with lots of things to collect. Going with the mindset of a breath of the wild type of open world sonic is the worst mistake you can make. Once you get used to it then it becomes quite fun, just focus on the main mission and forget everything else. The fun part is finding your way to the goal since its such a large map then there its lots of paths to take.

The story is somewhat interesting and a big improvement compared to previous sonic games, it is executed pretty poorly though. The pacing of the story is too quick, and the cut-scenes seem to be low quality compared to previous sonic games, the voice acting just doesn´t sit right with me, it seems like most voice actors (except roger, you did great) were recorded with no enthusiasm and low quality.

Overall the game feels like an experiment sonic team made to see if a change of formula is good for the series. Is it good? Not really, but its not bad either, it is however certainty not worth the price, so get it on sale.",,

I mean, seriously, SONIC has improved over the years! Do you guys not realize that? I mean, seriously, WHAT THE FRICK? I mean, ohhh, because, Sonic Colors, Sonic Generations, nor Sonic 4 Episodes 1 or 2 NEVER HAPPENED! I mean, seriously, WHAT THE FRICK? I mean, come on guys! Sega has improved! Sonic is not trash anymore! I know it’s kind of hard to believe after we got that MONSTROSITY, Sonic ’06. And I don’t care what you guys say! “Ooohh, Sonic ’06 was a good game. Sonic ’06. Best Sonic game ever~” AEEEEAAAAAHHHHHHRRAAAAUUUGHGHGHGH. Idiots!

And, I mean, people are saying Sonic is a Mario ripoff. NOOOOOO! And people are saying Sonic: Lost World is a Super Mario Galaxy ripoff. You see, I put papers on my desk for decoration in my videos, and of course I’ve got some Sonic: Lost World screenshots right here, but THAT’S NOT THE FRICKIN’ POINT!! Well, it kind of is actually! People are hating on Sonic: Lost World saying it’s copying off the Super Mario Galaxy. Well SONIC, as some of you may not know, has been doing—has been running on spherical objects since Sonic 1! EVER PLAYED SCRAP BRAIN ZONE? He’s been doing it since Sonic 3 & Knuckles, ever played Death Egg!? Or Carnival Night? And that’s not all, he’s been doing it since Sonic Adventure 2, and…LEAVE HIM ALONE!! LEAVE SONIC ALONE! Okay? And...

I don’t get all the hatred. Leave Sonic alone! I know Sonic isn’t what he used to be, and he probably never will be. But guess what? He’s good again!

I mean seriously, WHAT THE FRICK? exasperated panting

And…that’s not all! People are especially criticizing Sonic 4. YOU GUYS ARE THE ONES THAT CANCELLED SONIC 4: EPISODE 3. WHAT THE FRICK!? What was so bad about Sonic 4: Episode 1/Episode 2. I KNOW they weren’t as good as the classics! The classics were my first games, for crying out loud! I played the classics 10 years ago on Sonic Mega Collection, alright? When I was 5 years old! And…those games were stellar titles! Sonic 3 & Knuckles is the best SONIC GAME! But guess what!? That doesn’t. Mean. THE—NEWER GAMES ARE BAAAAAAAAAAAAAD. Newer games are still good! IDIOTS! I mean, seriously! And, Sonic 4. “Ooh, it didn’t have good enough physics! Oh, and the music was off. Oh! And the visuals were off! They need to be exactly like the classics..”GOAWAYGOAWAYGOAWAYGOAWAY! LEAVE. SONIC. ALONE! Alright? I know Sonic 4 was a—wasn’t exactly like the classics but THEY WERE GOING down the classic route! Alright? They were trying to appeal to you retro fans! But…you retro fans think it’s ALL ABOUT YOU. Alright? It’s NOT all about you! Sonic 4 was a great game. Even though I wish they could’ve picke—used the Retro Sonic..WHY DIDN’T THEY!?! Rrrrrrreugh...

Anyways…that doesn't matter! You guys can’t hate on Sonic like this, you can’t pick on Sonic like this! You bullies! You trolls! GO AWAY! Leave Sonic alone! panting And…I don’t get all the hatred Sonic Colors, Sonic Generations, and Sonic: Lost World. I got Sonic Colors right here…ehh..you see, HOW CAN YOU ARGUE THAT THIS IS A BAD GAME!? “Ooh, too much 2D-2D platforming.” SHUT UP! SHUUUUUUUUUTTT UUUUUUUUUP! panting LEAVE. SONIC. ALOOOOONE! Sonic is not a bad franchise anymore! ACCEPT IT! Sonic: Lost World will blow Call of Duty: Ghosts frickin’ away. Get the frick outta here! Get the frick out of here! GET THE FRICK OOOOOOOUUUUUUUTTTTT.

Alright, guys! As you all know, you see, this is what Sonic and Tails look like. You see, CARTOONISH-APPEAL. HOW CAN YOU ARGUE WITH THAT!? Rrrrugh…I mean, seriously, you call this unappealing to the eye? And all you people who criticize the Sonic games for having “Bad gameplay~ Oh, oh, and also, new lame characters, and too childish and it’s for furries!” Well GUESS WHAT I have to say to that? You all are FRICKING FRICKS!

And, I don’t care what you guys have to say about me. MAKE. FUN OF ME all you want. You can’t shoot me down with your ARROWS OF LIES! And..guess what? I am sick of this garbage…panting

How can you guys hate on Sonic, when your little Frick-Person-Shooters ARE NO BETTER!? And…I mean, seriously, “frick Sonic! Cause…Call of Duty, Halo, BioShock, oh oh, and just to name some others. Batman: Arkham Asylum…for frickin’ fricks…is so much better than Sonic! Oh oh! Sonic does not stand a chance…you know why? Cause we have NO TASTE IN GAMING!” Well here’s what I have to say to that…you. are all. SCUM! You. are all. SCUM! You are all SCUM! SCUMMMMMMMM!

And that’s not all, Sonic Haters!

And guys…please just give Sonic a chance…for me? Please Sonic haters, I know it’s hard to accept that Sonic’s changed, believe me, when Sonic Colors and Sonic 4 were announced, I was a bit skeptical…but Sega has redeemed Sonic! Give Sonic a chance…please…LEAVE ME ALONE! Give Sonic a chance…STOP ALL THIS HATRED! kicks fan over and throws Pac-man ghost

And one last thing I forgot to mention in the video! You guys treat Sonic like it’s trash, but you treat games like Halo, Call of Duty, BioShock, and et cetera et cetera et cetera, like it’s treasure. WHAT THE FRICK? I mean, seriously! I mean, you call…nnngh..like, “First person shooters” as we all know, have the same ty",,

good,,
"This is the best Sonic game in a LONG time! It's janky and sometimes glitches like many other sonic games but in terms of execution this is the most solid game since the early 2010s. I like the story and the lore and a few of the zones are fun to explore with Sonic's speed.

My biggest issues involve the skill tree, the tutorial and how glitchy the combat can be at times. I swear I had to look up how to parry and half the moves online in order to get some of the mechanics.

It's still a solid game and fun to explore in. As a Sonic fan I liked it plenty. It's a good step in the right direction. Maybe if you're still unsure wait for it to go on sale. It's worth playing if you like open world games.",,

This game slaps harder than my dad.,,
This game is lliterally peak shounen anime!,,
"as far i have played, there is alot camera bugs and annoing things like simple ""no information about ur skills are not avaiable"" in some part of the games, `cyber space` is a joke - movement like heavy Mario game clone.

Dear god, 60fps lock in 2k23 in game about speed and action. :(
Yes, im aware that fps unlock is possible - but more bugs can occure, especially in some parts of the game that belong to story.

Still its most enjoyable game from last 10 years with Sonic (expect Sonic Mania).

Open World looks like basic map from another game and Sonic looks in it like it was pasted in different game, like sam Fan-Game (which some fan games looks better than this). Whole Open world looks like pasted random objects, sonic sticks to ground too much,

sometimes object like to show on ur face 2M away, so u cant avoid it.

If u were a big fan of Sonic - Buy it on good promotion - its not worth to pay full price.

Repeating things like ""collect, run, collect, run"" from point A to B 100x times, gets annoying after some time.

Story? well... ""its here"" cant say anything bad and good about it.

Sometimes u cant even open MAP ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

Forced 2D sections that u get pushed to it JESUS CHRIST, and sometimes not working 2d sections. Why wven bother about 2d sections!?

Sorry Sega, just make remake of sonic 06 (remake not remaster).

"It's by no means anywhere close to perfect, but for what it is, Sonic Frontiers is an experience unlike anything else I've played - sometimes for the best and sometimes for the worst.

As the Final Horizons update has released and introduced new playable characters and almost exceedingly difficult bonus objectives, I can safely say that this is an enjoyable game, albeit a little rough around the edges.

There's tons of great story content, unlockables, and side objectives so you won't run out of things to do until around the 30 hour mark. I would say that the game is the most generally accessible Sonic game in the series, and I would recommend it to newcomers above all else.

The price does feel a little bit steep. While you are getting quite a lot of value out of the package, especially with the DLC which is free, it does feel like AAA pricing attached to non-AAA polish.

If the game is on sale, I'd recommend giving it a go. If it's not your cup of tea, you can always refund it after all.",,
"great story, each character is fleshed out and issues from previous characterisations has been addressed (especially tails!!) . Also loving all the new lore in this game and all the call backs to previous games.
game play is very fun and intuitive, a bit janky at times with the combat but a great start none the less.
soundtrack is phenomenal, with a mix of metal/rock/electronic etc.
visually very pleasing to look at, and the islands are very fun to explore and complete challenges.

overall, i would give this game an 8.5/10. love to see sonic having a great game again after all this time, well done sonic team!",,
"The next game in Sonic's never-ending journey is here, and boy does it not disappoint.

The tutorial is one of the best there is in my opinion as it is about 20 minutes long and tells you the bare minimum it needs to tell you and the rest of is up to you to learn. the game may give you subtle hints every so often just to keep you rolling, but by the time you reach the second open-zone, you will not see as many hint-boxes.

The combat in this game might be hard to understand at first, but if you keep playing and keep experimenting, it will eventually become second nature to you.

The story in this game is filled with mystery and even when you beat the game, you may not know everything about it, but by revisiting the open-zones, you can interact with the characters in places you might have missed when originally you might have zoomed past them or never noticed them before. If you have friends who have played the game, when you finish the game, you and your friends can have ""friendly"" debates about what some things in the game meant.

To add to all of this, you can hear random monologues from Sonic on every island of the game, even ""that"" island, and there are also set locations where Sonic can have a monologue, these help establish 2 things, 1, that the places in the game are similar and dissimilar to past areas he has been in, and 2, to say which things are canon because the timeline is already doing a figure 8 and knowing what is in fact canon to the timeline might help smooth it out. On the first island, Kronos Island, there is even a character mentioned in Sonic's monologues that most people might not have heard of because they were never in a mainline Sonic game before.

All of this story stuff makes people much more hyped for the three 2023 updates that Sonic Team plans on releasing because, realistically, anything can happen.

So if your boss for some reason decided to give you a bonus this month and you don't have any bills to pay, consider Sonic Frontiers, and if you do have some bills left to pay, consider putting Sonic Frontiers on your wishlist. That is the end of my review.",,

"Cyber Space is the best part of the game with how accessible speedrunning is by learning to homing attack cancel into a boost and utilizing the drop dash in 2D stages. The bounce is especially useful for quickly regaining an air boost as you're limited to one per air time and no longer regenerate from enemies, springs, and dash rings. The physics very much take getting used to compared to the other boost games but this is the tightest Sonic has controlled since Adventure. Even though the majority of the stages are reused layouts from past games, they play very differently and the speedrunning techs keep things fresh. The low skill floor and high skill ceiling was enough for me to stick around for 50+ hours and it feels incredibly rewarding.

Cyber Space also has the best music in the game with its incredibly massive variation in EDM genres from drum and bass to happy hardcore. It's addicting and cheers you on as you shave off precious seconds.

Only major problem I had with the open-zone were surplus collectibles being useless after they served their purpose and the lack of replay value. The trick system could've been utilized more like ending with a finisher but is instead only used to gain large amounts of skill pieces for a very small skill tree. Don't expect an endless gameplay loop, although post game content would've been nice and would solve these problems.",,
"Sonic Team watched Traitors and thought, ""Hey, that'd be a great idea! Let's make a new game full of innovation, high moments, a real sense of speed - but 10% of the team will be trying to code Sonic 2006 in secret"".

I had fun with this game, but also many moments of frustration - especially when I wanted it to be the game's high points (the various bosses). There's just so many fundamental breakages here, mostly not literal bugs but rather game design misses.

It feels half-baked and the sticking plasters are obvious (parry has no timing element? I bet that wasn't the original design), and it feels tragic, because maybe on a less aggressive release schedule this would be been a rare gem: a GOOD modern Sonic game.

I'd probably play it again just because I had so much fun noodling around the levels at great speed, but not for £50. This ""no"" is a qualified one - if you're a Sonic fan this is worth checking out at a deep discount. But don't say I didn't warn you - you'll be googling ""how do I beat this boss"" and then sighing at the crappy solution in a few hours time.",,
"This is just the worst sonic game. EDIT: It's just the worst game. Spoilers will be at the very bottom.

The story is just so aggressively bad, because they keep trying to take the game seriously. It feels like a 4 year old wrote it because for no reason at all things just happen.

The boss fights? Terrible damage sponges, and the worst offender of all is the third boss. It just runs around the arena and the camera spins and disorients you constantly.

The islands are just fluff with random story moments. The first two are fun and they were fairly polished, but the second you get to the third island there is a very clear drop in quality. The map collision constantly sent me flying into the air when I was just trying to run on the ground.

Speaking of running, sonic feels so terribly slow in this game when you aren't using the boost. His max speed is very slow for a hedgehog, whose catchphrase is ""Gotta go fast."" I get the difference between 'running' and 'walking,' but it's so severe that it is terrible to control. The rails instantly take away all momentum you had going into them, so it just ends up being you boosting every time you get on a grind rail.

Another very cool thing about this game is that there are just random things floating in the air. You can't even really call them challenges as you just go through them and end up getting a memory piece. It almost makes me glad that the render distance is so low, because it means you don't have to stare at the jumble of floating platforms and rails scattered throughout the maps.

When you get to the fourth map of the game, it is just a horrible section. You do the same thing over and over with no choice of variety. Then the story gets shoved down your throat and tries to seem dramatic but you know nothing bad is going to happen to our Hero. There are 0 plot twists. Everything that happens is so painfully obvious ahead of time.

A final note I have is that there really is no variety in the game. Sure, there are many different enemy types but you take them all out in one of three ways. 1, you just press the attack button. 2, you cyclone dash around and then press the attack button. 3, you sit in a long interactive cut scene and then press the attack button. Outside of the enemies, the game play is just you walking around collecting memory fragments and occasionally going into a level and getting vault keys. There is nothing to do. It's nothing throughout the whole game.

Here's just a fun opinion I have: The fishing mini-game is the worst fishing mini-game to exist. Period.

Go play Sonic Unleashed instead, because that game at least had fun variety of game play in it.


SPOILER TOWN -
The final boss isn't actually anything. It's a glorified cut scene that you can die in, and goes on for a set amount of time. The credits song is terrible, the ending of the story - if you can even call it a story - is somehow worse than the rest of the game and as predictable as sonic becoming super sonic. If you like this game, I genuinely want to understand why. I'm not trying to ♥♥♥♥ on your opinion, I just truly want to understand HOW anyone can enjoy this game.",,

Best Sonic game since Adventure.,,
A blue hedgehog game has a better soundtrack than nfs unbound heck yeah!,,
murder robots (in style),,
"Nintendo didn't hire this man, so Sonic Team did",,
9/10,,
"If you love automation, reused level assets and designs, pop-in, floating rails, going fast sometimes, and playing space invaders along side many more braindead puzzles, then its perfect for you! If not wait for a price drop then :D",,
"The game is great. Not perfect, but by far the best foot forward the series has had in years. Controls are mostly solid, my only real complaint I've run into being the Camera being a bit troublesome in main boss fights, the story is solidly the best part of the game thus far, and the character interaction is great as well.

The open world aspect of it is interested and while a couple of the enemies are more annoying than challenging but the field bosses are quite something. The Cyberspace Levels play out well for the most part, but boosting can be a bit hard to control at some points. The times required for S-rank can be rather challenging on some levels.

Overall, I'd say this is a solid 8/10, and would greatly suggest it to fans of the series, and it's probably the best starting point for new folks to the series in a long, long time",,
"6.5/10 The game starts off very strong, open zone is a concept that could potentially work, and some very cool fights. Gets more boring as the game goes on with an underwhelming and anticlimactic finale. Story is unfocused, dialogue is awkward, voice acting is the worst its been, physics are jank. while its definitely better than some of the stuff released since 2013, this isnt the direction sonic needs to go in right now.",,
"Might be the most fun Sonic game I've played so far. The open world feels great, the game gives you tons of options to proceed in the story, completion isn't too hard and overall it's just really well designed.

The stages are fun, the enemy design is cool, the fights feel awesome and the music is incredible.
I had a blast with this game so I can definitely recommend this!",,
fun,,
run,,
"Finally, it only took Sonic Team Nearly a decade for a Sonic game that generally most people agrees is good.



although did i really need to buy the game on 3 different platforms?",,
Early in playing on steam deck & works great 👍 I find it entertaining.,,
Peak,,
In all my years of gaming this is it. This is peak gaming,,
Sonic Frontiers,,
"There's a lot I can say about this game: the music is great (as always), the writing is the most solid the series has ever had, the visuals are nice; but at the end of the day, the one thing that matters is that I just kept coming back for more because the gameplay loop was just that fun all the way to 100% completion. Sure it's not perfect (the final boss comes to mind as the most obvious criticism), but ultimately the game is still so fun that I'd consider it my favorite 3D sonic ever, and even one of my favorite games period.",,
"Buy it on sale. First decent 3D sonic game in a while. It does rehash story beats from previous games and the ending can be a bit anti-climactic. The open world design although pleasant, will start to wear thin by the third island; you do the same gameplay loop for four of the five islands. Overall, if you like the blue hedgehog already then you'll probably enjoy this game.",,
"game is ok, i feel the thing that makes this game show it's true colors are it's main story boss battles but there is only 4 of them and the last one isn't good which makes me happy and sad because the game as a whole should be good not just sections",,
"Sonic Frontiers is a really fun game that has more than a fair share of flaws. The character controller/physics in Cyber Space levels feel unsatisfying and slippery, Cyber Space level design is only okay (levels taken from previous games are alright, but are too short and lack the polish of the game they came from), pop-in is noticeable (though definitely not game-breaking), and the mini-bosses can be quite annoying. And overall, I don't think the 2D sections really worked. In the Open Zone, it restricted movement which was incredibly annoying when I happened across a spring or booster by accident. In the Cyber Space, it better, but the physics were still quite bad.

On the topic of Cyber Space physics, it's really hard not to draw comparisons to Sonic Generations. Sonic Generations has a really good feel for Sonic's physics with a very fluid feel. In contrast, Sonic Frontiers is much slower and has regular full stops. For example, the rebound after using a homing attack needs to fully play before continuing. This means that Sonic is stuck basically still for this period of time. In Sonic Generations, the rebound animation still plays, but you can continue moving forward and even interrupt it after a short period. The boost is also shattered in Sonic Frontiers. No longer does it destroy enemies or give you lots of speed. Now it's just a small speed boost that refills over time. Luckily, most of these issues can be fixed by using a mod.

Sonic Frontiers succeeds in delivering a fun game that shows that Sonic Team still knows how to make a game fun, but it isn't quite ready. Running around the open zones is great and the challenges are surprisingly connected given their seemingly ""slapped on"" appearance. The story is also a nice change, even though I didn't think the game did it justice (weak cutscene animation and lack of details).

There are also a few personal opinions that don't really stand any argumentative ground. I wasn't a fan of the Cyber Space music. That genre just doesn't work for me and I found myself muting it instead. Though I do know many other people enjoyed it. I found the boss music and themes quite enjoyable though. Overall, I really enjoyed this game (despite only really talking about its flaws), but it isn't perfect.

"Best Sonic game in years.

I had nothing but an amazing time throughout the game, and I absolutely loved the story and gameplay.
Sega and Sonic Team, please stick with this. Don't drop this next game, keep building on top of the Open Zone format.",,
"The first boss fight crushed whatever lingering worries I had since this game was announced. I recommend it to the highest degree. This is the best Sonic game to come out in over a decade (in my eyes), and I truly am thankful that Sega are finally doing Sonic right. Please get it when you can, it is so fun and so exciting and so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AWESOME!!!",,
"Oh my god they did it. Sonic Team, in the year of our lord 2022, made a GOOD open world 3D Sonic game. Like I'm not kidding, there is so much love here. You may be skeptical, and I sure was, but the moment you get into the game and really feel it out, you realize that this might just be the ideal future for Sonic - stages that are short but sweet bursts with a modicum of replayability (getting all the missions done for a stage doesn't take as long as getting all the medals in an Adventure game stage, but that's actually for the best honestly), surrounded by an open world that is genuinely fun to navigate, explore, and find every little hidden nook and cranny. Sonic's moveset has never felt better, incorporating things like Mania's brilliant Drop Dash with a ton of new techniques that make platforming and fighting feel like they won't ever get stale.

Ian Flynn and his writing team have made certain to include a ridiculous yet healthy amount of fanservice for old fans of both the franchise and the lost Archie comics (screw you, Penders...) This feels like an amalgamation of years of pent-up Sonic celebration, all coming together into a product that does just that - celebrates Sonic - better than I think Generations did.

I finally see a new frontier for 3D Sonic, and it's looking bright.

EDIT: I did nearly forget to mention maybe the one issue I've encountered so far, and it's one we've all been aware of since the previews after the game's announcement - there is hella pop-in. I think it might be a necessary evil due to the sheer amount of grind rails and other props for Sonic to use on any given island, but it does feel kind of... irritating.",,
"Sonic is back.

Update: I just 100%'d the game and I think this might be my favorite modern sonic game now",,
It's good.,,
"I have to update my review after playing the game all the way through and getting all achievements. I list all the Pros/Cons below, but please read this thoroughly as I go over everything with this game without spoilers and some of the social BS that's going around.. If you loved the stories from SA1, SA2, Unleashed, etc. Then this game is a love letter to you.

First off, I have issues with this game myself, BUT if you came here from Dunkey's video I can tell you the utter truth is that he lied thoroughly about the game. He didn't even point out its actual flaws that the game DOES have. For some reason he did this specifically wrong to MAKE UP issues that aren't actually there. It's sad to say, but he has decided to take the Egoraptor route ever since TLOU2 released. He even compared this to Hades.. they're not even in the same Genre. Completely stupid and skewed. And he played as bad as the cup-head game journalist and failed to beat minigames while ignoring the simple kid-could-do-it rules and tutorial the game puts RIGHT on your screen.

I'm an oldtime Sonic fan. I HATE Forces, Boom, etc. But LOVE Adventure 1 and 2, love Unleashed. I love the well-written Sonic, the heroic one that actually gives inspiration. The dark undertones of his story while keeping Sonic as the ""Beacon of hope"" among everything happening vibes. Much like Adventure 1.

I can SAFELY say that Sega finally brought the Sonic from early 2000s back, and it is AWESOME.

My actual criticisms:

1. The interactive platforming junk littered on the world are REALLY FUN, and adrenaline filling, but they ARE an eye-sore. They could do a little better to make them feel part of the environment. But again, they are still fun which makes up for it and they feel good. The pop-in people complain about isn't that bad, because if everything rendered from a far the world would be a mess to look at.

2. The game defaults your control of Sonic to pretty bad settings. In this game you can tweak Sonic himself like he was a car in the options. You NEEEED TO DO THIS as soon as you start the game for it to feel good. If you want the closest controls to Adventure 1/2, then max out Top Speed, and then everything below that ISN'T already 100% be set to 75%. Everything that was 100% by default should stay 100%. Alternatively, set ALL options to 100% for more of a SRB2 feeling.

3. The CyberStages are FUNNNN, but for some reason only 2 stages have difficult S-ranks. The rest of the stages, while extremely fun, have pitifully easy S-ranks to achieve. Still though, you can try speed-trialing your friends.

4. The whole actual story and whats going on isn't streamlined. Personally it does not bother me! You have to do side quests, and do fishing to learn everything that's happening in the story. The game doesn't force you to do this though. But the problem is you will have people ONLY DO THE MAIN QUESTS, and then feel lost on the story, and wonder why it was short. It's ""Short"" because the sidequests people ignore are actually 75% of the rest of the story. So make sure you do side-quests if you loved SA1's story!

That's honestly the only cons I can think of. As for pros:

1. It's specifically a Sonic Adventure 1 love-letter to people who liked that game's story.

2. The platforming, and Sonic FEELS AMAZING. And it's very skillll-oriented. The jumping will feel weird and slow, but this is actually because the game DOESN'T HOLD YOUR HAND. It's been YEARS since Sonic hasn't held your hand through gameplay. You actually have to learn tech, figure out mechanics, etc. to make up for the bad jumping. Trust me, you can be fast and very fluid in this game if you practice and learn all the neat tricks you can do with Sonic. + You can tweak him like a car in the settings.

3. Beautiful art-direction. It feels like the cutscenes from Sonic 06 that you WISH were the actual game. Frontiers looks kind of ugly at first glance... but trust me, when you beat stage 1-2, and the sun comes out in the open world? It all just POPS out at you. It's not graphically impressive, but artistically it went a fantastic direction once the sun comes out and the colors pop out, the bloom on sonic.. etc. Don't believe me? Check out my Frontiers Screenshots. They're jaw dropping and nostalgia. You will feel that nice warm feeling PS3/360 gave you when you first got them as a kid.

4. FANTASTIC STORY. FANTASTIC CHARACTER WRITING. I CAN'T STRESS IT ENOUGH. I never cry to a story almost ever. The last time a game made me cry was the ending of Metal Gear Solid 4. If you love 2000's Sonic, then this will mess you up LOL.

5. OSTs are the BEST they've ever been. Sadly there is still no Crush 40 but DO NOT WORRY. The soundtrack in this game will live your socks blown clean off. You will see when you get all 7 Emeralds. Trust me.

6. CUSTOMIZABLE SONIC CONTROL. I've been pointing it out in this review already, but this is a GENIUS idea. If you wish, you can make Sonic feel identical to Sonic: Unleashed, or identical to SA1, or your favorite fan-game! It's a genius idea. I recommend putting it all 100% personally.

7. Cool islands. Not much spoiler as they teased these anyway, but you go from nice grassylands to harsh deserts. All VERY FUN to run through aimlessly. I tend to forget there's even quests sometimes because it's fun to have Sonic just run around doing whatever. Ever just run around aimlessly in the Mystic Ruins for the fun of it in SA1 while having your favorite snack? Those vibes man. Those vibes.

8. Callbacks to old beloved stages. They're re skinned so they might not be recognizable, but the CyberStages are actually SA1, SA2, Sonic06, Sonic: Unleashed! They just have a different coat of paint. I will not say why, but it's an actual reason to the game's plot.

9. Best. Boss Battles. Ever. When you start this game, the first enemies are NOT actually bosses. You only fight actual bosses when you get the 7 emeralds. TRUST ME THESE ARE THE BEST BOSSES SONIC EVER HAD. You like Metal Gear Rising: Revengance? YOU'LL LOOOOOVVVEEE these fights then.

10. Mechanics out the wazoo. There's so many little mechanics, so much tech akin to wavedashing just to bend Sonic to your control. It's amazing. There's a LOT you can do to make Sonic fast and feel good.

I'll leave the pros at that before this review gets too massive. Just try the game for yourself, open your heart and just enjoy the ride.",,
It exceded my expectatives,,
Very fun game with lots of content.,,
"Sonic is back. Perhaps more importantly, Sega and Sonic Team are back. For all the issues, shortcomings, and flaws this game may have... it is something truly special. For me, all that really matters is that they tried. The passion, love, care, and understanding this game radiates is second to none for me. If you enjoy Sonic even just a little bit, if you care to feel like a kid again, or if you're just looking for a good time, the Blue Blur has got you covered. I'm ecstatic to see what more comes to Frontiers in the future, but as of now this was an amazing time and I can nearly guarantee that you will enjoy it too. To the many, many people that made this project possible, no matter how much or little you contributed, thank you for reminding just why I love this franchise so much and truly putting forth what feels like you're best effort. It shows, and is much appreciated!",,

A lot of potential but still incomplete as a whole,,
best sonic game yet,,
amazibfng,,
"game good, good game",,
"I enjoyed my time with the game, bugs and pop in aside it was worth the money",,
"The movement in this game is atrocious. Sonic moves slower than he ever has before, and somehow he still manages to have terrible handling. Most of the time I found myself fighting against Sonic to get him to move in the direction I wanted him to.

The menus in the game are awful, requiring you to first open the menu, then select the menu before you can actually navigate through it. Just like the rest of the game, getting through the menus is a slow, tedious slog.

The game is split into stages you have to find and unlock by traveling through the open world. The stages all feel like cheap, poorly made imitations of Sonic Generations stages. The open world feels fine at first, but then you'll frequently get sucked into a section of the open world that is strictly side-scrolling.

The only good parts about this game are the music and writing. Though, you'll really only enjoy the story if you're familiar with Sonic lore. And if you didn't know Sonic had lore, many of the lines of dialogue will go over your head as characters reminisce about older, better Sonic games. But when they aren't reminiscing, the dialogue is excellent and carries the charm one expects from a Sonic game.

Most of the bosses are repetitive, with the strategy being parry then mash the attack button before entering a Quick Time Event to finish the boss off. The final ""boss"" fight is the biggest let down, getting rid of the parry and button mash and opting for three button presses in a single QTE. The fishing is more interesting than the final boss.

Speaking of fishing, you need to collect multiple different collectibles to progress through the story. While these can be found in the open world areas, the most enjoyable way to collect them is to find the fishing stage for that island, catch all the fish, and then trade in the fishing token for the collectibles from Big. And I say this as someone that has no love for fishing minigames.

If you're a die hard Sonic fan, this is a pretty bad Sonic game, but you're probably used to bad Sonic games. If you aren't a die hard Sonic fan, steer clear because this has nothing for you.",,
"When I first got this game for my switch I thought it was amazing but then my switch broke then I got it on PC and its even better!

Edit: After Completing the main story, this game was a chef's kiss though sometimes the 2D stages are a bit slow and choppy. The speed in cyberspace is pretty slow besides that everything in this game was amazing, I will edit again when I do the side story.

Edit (2): I have finally completed the side story and I've got to say the final boss on easy mode is pretty easy (well obviously) but even on easy it still take a little bit of time to beat, if you want to fight it I would recommend to raise your ring capacity first. The map is WAY harder to discover than the main story Ouranos Island you have to actually play as tails, amy, and knuckles to discover the entire map the challenges are way harder. The cyberspace levels have more things for you to collect which sucks because it slows down your time massively nothing much changed in the cyberspace levels besides that, I hope that this game continues to get updates to make it better though with the release of sonic superstars and dream team I feel thats their main priority.",,

"months of waiting for a dlc update that completely misses the point of everything that was enjoyable about the original game and replaces it with horrendous amounts of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, unfair and borderline unplayable enemy design and gameplay",,
"While filled with a variety of minigames, challenges, and collectables, the overall experience of Sonic Frontiers is half hearted from beginning to end. The game never develops its own personality, choosing instead to constantly throw you from one brief minigame to the next all of which a reasonably experienced gamer will have seen and done before with much better execution.

The game has some bright spots: it's clear the developers realized it was a shame that the super sonic battles were left to the end of most sonic games, and often locked behind 100% completion, so instead this game gives us several super sonic battles sprinkled across the adventure. These are usually fun and cinematic, and feel good even though they're mostly just dumb QTEs. The ""Main"" platforming levels feel right out of Sonic Colors where they provide short, sometimes gimmicky platforming challenges with time limits and collectables, although do we really need Green Hill Zone, Chemical Plant Zone and Sky Sanctuary Zone yet again? Sega, please let us see 3D Springyard Zone someday for a change. The characterization of the sonic characters is actually pretty fun, although this comes at the caveat that most people probably don't care for sonic friends even when done well. The variety and briefness of the challenges keeps them from getting dull, but they are never really fun either.

The minigames are a boring collection of hamiltonian paths, grabbing falling spheres, or quick draw parry challenges. None of these are interesting. The few minigames that are more complex are executed poorly; one late game challenge has a player bouncing around in the most depressing single-screen pinball table ever conceived, a tragic insult in a universe where Sonic Spinball already exists. A cut-the-grass minigame appears out of nowhere, but then vanishes before the gimmick can even begin to be explored. The game feels like a hodgepodge of programming school projects bundled up and shipped the moment they were barely functional.

Other elements of the game just feel untested. Buying speed and ring upgrades one a time (99 times each!) in painful slowness seems like a huge oversight when every other menu and upgrade is breezy and fast (it is a Sonic game!). The fishing minigame offers golden tickets that let you trade for a single item, but in the later fishing holes an average catch buys more than a ticket, making tickets a booby prize in the late game. The overworld is filled with bumpers, dash pads, and grind rails, but they have an obnoxious tendency to send you flying in a different direction than you wanted, resulting in long cross-country jaunts forcing you to fight against the terrain in an awkward way. The game just feels rushed and incomplete.

For a small child who is obsessed with Sonic, the overall package is probably appealing. Easy, varied challenges, flashy boss fights, and lots of options for progression (just fish all those macguffins up!). For very nearly anyone else, this is a brief curiosity that ultimately is forgotten as a mish-mash of minigames done poorly and little else to tie it all together.",,

this game changed my life. thank you blue hedgehog,,
New 3D Sonic games haven't been this good since Generations,,

Edit: (09/30/2023) The three updates were Awesome.
I liked how you can edit the physics to be less janky.
The way you could unlock the spin-dash and you could upgrade your boost, Liked that. Holy crap. Update 3, it's amazing. Certainly not perfect though. I liked how the guardians were buffed.
The playable characters were a bit too weak for the island.
I didn't like how they got rid of the enemies around the island.
The final boss, Holy crap. You've gotta play it.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is a must buy game,even if you're seeing this review after update 3 has dropped
But you know what else is a 10/10? Red velvet cake with cream cheese

Here's what you'll need plus how to bake it

**Ingredients:**
- 2 and 1/2 cups (340g) all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup (35g) cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons (12g) unsweetened cocoa powder (any kind works)
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup (1 stick/115g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
- 2 and 1/8 cups (425g) granulated sugar
- 1 cup (240 ml) vegetable oil
- 4 large eggs, room temperature and separated
- 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar
- liquid or gel red food coloring

**Instructions:**
1. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease two 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
3. In a large mixing bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat butter on high speed until smooth and creamy - about 1 minute. Add granulated sugar and beat on high speed for 2 minutes until creamed together fairly well. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.
4. On medium-high speed, add oil to the butter/sugar mixture in a slow steady stream until fully combined and creamy - about 2 minutes. Add egg yolks and vanilla extract and beat on medium-high speed until combined. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.
5. Beat egg whites and vinegar together in a medium bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment or whisk vigorously by hand until thick and foamy - about 3 minutes. See photo above for a visual. Do not over-beat; you want soft peaks.
6. Fold egg whites into cake batter: Remove bowl from stand mixer if using one. Using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, gently fold egg whites into cake batter until combined.
7. Add red food coloring: Using a toothpick or liquid dropper, add red food coloring to batter until desired color is reached.
8. Pour batter evenly into prepared cake pans. Tap the cake pans gently on the counter to bring any air bubbles to the top and smooth out the surface of each cake.
9. Bake for around 25-30 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it's done.
10. Remove cakes from oven and cool completely in their pans set on a wire rack before frosting.

Congrats you now have an amazing cake to enjoy while playing the best 3D sonjc game of the year",,
"Zeldonic: Shadowy Colossal Breath of Frontiers
As the admirer of the games about Sonic (not a fanboy), I've been expecting a change of stream, so-called ""breath of fresh air"" (well, I didn't expect copying ""Breath of the wild"" though). This particular game caught my attention and, at the same time, it rose some doubt regarding the newly-designed concept and its sustainability. As for me, I greatly enjoyed Sonic Adventure games, as well as Sonic Heroes and Sonic Generations. Nevertheless, you can't always enter the same waters with the same level of success (unless you're part of CoD franchise and/or those featureless EA Sports simulators/StarWars games). However, I expected something new at the very least.
Sonic Frontiers is a unique entitity without its own identity - that's the best description for it. This game tries its best to copy all and every feature of every more or less successful game of the last five years and beyond. My first and foremost impressions are less than optimistic due to certain reasons:
- First of all, the atmosphere of the adventure. It's constantly crying ""Loooook! I'm just like ""Breath of the wiliiiid""! Looook oveeeer thereeee! We have the post-apocalyptic environment and dramatic history of the island! We also have matching dim colors! Rain! Even the speed indicator looks like the one displaying Link's remaining stamina! Isn't that awesome?!!"" No, it is not. Zelda BotW is a melancholic slow-pace adventure, which exploits refined phisical and elements-based mechanics. Moreover, I had a lot of pain adjusting to Zelda's controls, pace and countless MC deaths. Besides, this melancholy doesn't suit the lightning-fast exploration and overall cheerful tone of Sonic and his previous adventures. However, Sonic team kept copying every single aspect of Zelda BotW. Check those charming sounds which accompany hitting the switches, clearing local variation of shrines (map beacons) and triggering plot-related objects. Do they remind you one of the best-selling games of 2017? I'm not a marioboy or Nintendo fan, but I can clearly see the source of ""inspiration"".
- Total controls remapping. Due to the new features introduced in this game (like levelling, skill trees, upgrades, endless farm and grind), all my previous Sonic games control patterns got trashed. Well, this is fixable, if the gameplay is enjoyable. Unfortunately, it is not.
- Farm and grind. Due to change of gameplay and even the core of the concept iself, now you have to endlessly farm and grind shards/fragments/skill points/chaos emeralds/cyberspace keys/cybergears etc., in order to unlock further game progression. Seriously?! Why should every new game have that blasted ""open world"" with countless ""question marks/boss marks/grind spots""? Why Judgement and Lost Jedgement CAN provide 50-60 hours of FUN and EXCITING story with enjoyable side-activities without obligatory engless farm and grind? And this ""Adventure"" game tries to enslave me as a player to spend countless hours exploring empty, dim and unintersting world offering a bunch of mediocre dialogs and weird boss-fighting experience as a reward.
- Those ""prize-winning"" dialogs. Many players keep saying the dialogs in this game are great. Have you ever read any great dialogs? Well, if we compare these new dialogs to the ones of the previous games - there's a remarkable improvement. However, they are mediocre to the core.
- Horrible battles with the titans. Seems like Sonic Team attempted to copy Shadows of the Collossus concept and mix it with overgrown Geth combat platforms from ME series. It feels odd due to lacking combat system and unsual controls.
- Annoying BGM and weird songs playing during boss fights and story events. I always liked music of the previous games (especially Adventure DX) and matching sountrack, but this one seems so much out of place.
- But the most vivid and obvious problem of the game... Guess what? It's supremely BORING. It sets grindwalls almost everywhere: Can't defeat the titan? Go farm some seeds and upgrade your atk/def. Can't progress the main story? Go farm some current character collectibles (aka character shards). Can't explore the area fast? Go search for more local aliexpress chao in order to upgrade your speed. Repeatative battles with the same robots make it even worse.
Also, the game doesn't explain some mechanics. For example, one of the beacons spawns some large blue lights and starts the timers. How should you interact with them? Can you interact with them now or should you unlock skill/buy upgrade? Try guessing yourself. At the same time, the so-called ""training simulator"" will keep posting you tips and reminders of what you already know.
As a conclusion: I would love to play remake of combined Sonic Adventure DX+ Sonic Adventure 2 featuring decent graphics and some QoL modifications instead of this Zeldonic: Breath of Frontiers, for this game, unfortunately, can't compete with Nintendo's creation in the slightest and loses its identity under the pile of crudely copied concepts.",,
Really not a good game. Controls are wack and just doesnt feel good.,,
Absolute banger game fr fr,,
this game's view and control feels like it's designed for aliens.Also dont try to press hint within a boss fight cause it'll reset the entire ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss fight even tho it's 1hp. yea makes total ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense sega.,,
"Now, this was interesting.

My experience with Sonic games has been varied over the years; From the days of the Sega Genesis to the ill demise of the Dreamcast. Sonic Frontiers is something different.

From the opening menu we are met with longing piano music and an evening sky. The game begins with one of its awkwardly long cinematics surrounding Dr. Robotnik and his evil scheme of the week, but this quickly goes awry. It isn't long before Sonic, Tails, and Amy are sucked into the mix.

It is a plot that involves (of course) the chaos emeralds, vastly superior ancient technology, crazy massive boss monsters, and the very odd relationship between hardened bad guy and little emo-girl AI. Piqued your interest? Did I mention you've gotta go fast?

The game doesn't bind itself with many of the regular design conventions. Yes, there are diverse monsters and combat moves to defeat them, but the unadulterated ""gotta go fast"" experience, the one that can break the game or your relationship with it as it hurdles at Mach 1* over the country side, is unique.

Open world Sonic game in which Quixel megascan environments blur by realistically as you proverbially attack rails, hoops, bouncers, and balloons. What is this? Something fresh. Throw in tricky skill based combat and mini bosses with crazy gimmicks, and add in some mandatory mini-games to frustrate the players.

This is one odd game, but one that has polish, a straight laced storyline in which Sonic always just takes things as they come (very grounding), and a fervent desire to do things differently.

The game has an extensive over-world segment broken up by digital worlds that handle like a classic sonic game from various eras. 3D, 2D, mixtures. They do some crazy stuff here. Stuff I can easily recommend.

For the completionists out there I do have to say there is far too much to do than is required. There are more power-ups than you need, more collectibles than can unlock anything, and just a sheer mess of an in game economy. Sometimes you will work hard for one collectible, but on the way a simple enemy jump point will drop an item of equivalent value making the whole course and its end goal seem redundant. The balance is off!

The way they hand out items is surprisingly uneven. I found this a touch charming, but also demotivating for some of he harder challenges (which will reward you with the same item you just got from a random robot bad guy. Huh.). But, gotta go fast remains the motto throughout.

The level design promotes fluid acquisition. You fly from course to course in the over-world, many of them connected. You unlock small puzzle challenges that help with traversal, and there are fast travel points as well for when you just don't want to trek across the landscape.

If anything above has resonated with you (and note I've left out plenty), I can easily recommend the game. It is odd and unique and not what one might expect from a Sonic game, but it is a blast of fresh air.

Give it a shot.",,

I'd say it's the first sonic game i enjoyed without any second thoughts at all.
I'm so happy to be alive to try this game!
It's also the only OPEN WORLD game I have ever truly enjoyed without a worry of missing items and secrets!",,
"Unforgivably janky and unpolished... but an incredibly fun and inspired attempt at a more modern Sonic game. Just about everything here is a broken mess, but Sonic Team's take on open-world in a sea of slowly paced AAA open-world games is strangely refreshing. This entire game is designed around going wherever you want as fast as you can, with open world objectives and fights that support this core design philosophy.

Hopefully the next one will feel less like an early access title... but sonic is back, so take a chance on this experiment.",,

"Best story since SA2, very nice gameplay loop, excellent level design, very neat graphics.

Only bad thing Is the 60fps cap (You can uncap it with Cheat engine which is playable but it causes some physic issues and issues in the cinematics as well), and The notorious pop in. But the game is so good I think you may be able to overlook that.",,
"Just beat the game and I can say I had a pretty enjoyable experience over all.
Pros: The story is absolutely the best thing about this game. The references and connecting lore was just wonderful to experience. The Super Sonic fights were a visual treat and cinematic. Some of the open world bosses are also great to fight as well.

Cons: The camera being ripped from you constantly. The hitstop on the homing attack was just bad. Boosting in Cyberspace felt awful because it would just stop for no reason. The open world is neat but repetitive. It can get dull very fast. Also leveling up your speed 1 at a time is just dumb.

I still overall give the game a positive rating. I enjoyed myself even with the issues and don't feel I wasted my money or my time. Definitely one of the better games.",,
yes,,
Great game! They need to fix a lot of the bugs going on atm though... :\,,
you get to fight the angels from Evangelion as Sonic,,
"Sonic Frontiers let's us see Sega has learned from mistakes with past 3D Sonic games. It emphasizes Sonic's strengths, giving you a huge hub area as a playground, with tons of secrets to discover. Between these discoveries, you'll find thrones you need to activate to access more traditional Sonic levels. These levels are great so far, and they usually have a time to beat of around 1:30 minutes, which is very achievable and makes them a joy to retry to get better times. They have great music too! This game loop got me instantly hooked, and while I have only cleared the first island, I can say confidently that this is a right step forward for the franchise. It very obviously copied a lot of things from Breath of the Wild's world design, but I think Sonic fits perfectly, and being able to zoom across the map in seconds feels very rewarding.

The story tries to explore characters more in depth than other games in the past. It gives you several cut scenes of Sonic interacting with their friends and a lot of the story ones are animated really good, and are great for character development. I wouldn't call the story good, but it's serviceable.

Talking about bad points: The combat can feel very wonky, the dash can sometimes just send you flying off levels (as usual), and the camera can be sometimes atrocious. The pop in of objects in the map is insane, it can be very distracting at times. And while the voices are better than they were in the past, they can sometimes sound like a 4Kids 90's dub.

Having all these things considered, it's still a strong recommendation, and a great game so far. I can't wait to see how this new formula develops in the future.",,

"A sonic game with a little something for all fans

if you enjoy classic 2D side scrolling Sonic or the more open worldliness of modern games I believe that there is something that can catch any sonic fan's eyes in this entry. The progression system is interesting, the combat can be as complex as you want it to be, the open world and sub fights/levels within it are engaging and plentiful, new mechanics are fun, and overall can be tied together for an overall good Sonic game.

Most of all, there are some sick ass boss fights in the game, you are super sonic multiple times, and (while we miss crush 40) the soundtrack is great. (minus the fact that when you start boosting it can sound like a Microsoft Teams chat notification that will throw you off if you are supposed to be working while playing the game).

Detailed review and breakdown below:

---{ Graphics }---
☐ You forget what reality is
☐ Beautiful
☑ Good
☐ Decent
☐ Bad
☐ Don‘t look too long at it
☐ MS-DOS

Notes: The graphics look (in my opinion) great. As goofy as it started to feel after the first reveals that all of these rails and different platforms in the world didn't make sense, being in a ""cyber space"" theme it creates more possibility for creativity. It never really had that feeling of ""wow this world is created just for sonic"" because in this context, of course it has.

---{ Gameplay }---
☐ Very good
☑ Good
☐ It's just gameplay
☐ Mehh
☐ Watch paint dry instead
☐ Just don't

Notes: The game itself controls well and the way that it handles the open world platforming is very interesting as it locks you into certain camera angles once you do something to trigger it. Sometimes that ""something"" can be hitting a spring or a dash pad that throws you into a small platforming section of the world.

However, it can get annoying if you didn't intentionally do this and were trying to traverse somewhere else as you either have to find a way to break out of the camera lock to go lets say east/west when you are locked in directionally going north/south. It can also be frustrating in the non open more classic sonic levels where you are running because it can cause sonic to feel floaty and harder to control especially if you are in a section of the level where the camera angle changes or there are other moving parts. A lot of the time you can excuse this when playing because its easy to identify, but when you are tasked with collecting things within these levels it can make simple jump and collects pretty annoying.

---{ Audio }---
☑ Eargasm
☐ Very good
☐ Good
☐ Not too bad
☐ Bad
☐ I'm now deaf

Notes: The music is so sick. Metal Gear Rising levels of sick during boss fights.

---{ Audience }---
☑ Kids
☑ Teens
☑ Adults
☐ Grandma

Notes: Sonic fans of all ages can enjoy this title. I do think however that those who are into the sonic adventure 1/2 games will enjoy this especially. However, there are a decent amount of classic sonic side scrolling feeling levels to scratch that itch and can provide serious challenge when it comes to beating times.


---{ PC Requirements }---
☐ Check if you can run paint
☑ Potato
☐ Decent
☐ Fast
☐ Rich boi
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer

---{ Difficulty }---
☐ Just press 'W'
☑ Easy
☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Significant brain usage
☐ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls


There was never a time in the game where I found myself having to really ""grind out"" different levels of collectables. The general pace goes like this:

Open world sonic spawns> collect the characters memory tokens via open world platforming and white glowing signs> fight open world mini boss monsters for cogs> use cogs to unlock levels> levels (depending on what challenges you complete) award keys> keys unlock chaos emeralds.

During this time you will do most of your hunting for the memory tokens. I never found any real issues fighting mini bosses or gaining keys from the levels. I do wish however that it was easier to find the classic sonic levels in the open world as there were some that I did miss meaning that you don't have to complete all of the sonic levels to complete the game. This to me kind of was lackluster as there were a few different really cool levels I missed out on during my first playthrough that I didn't know about.

---{ Grind }---
☐ Nothing to grind
☑ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☐ Isn't necessary to progress
☐ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You'll need a second life for grinding

Notes: as noted before the only real ""grind"" you will be doing is for those memory tokens. Unlocking abilities on the tree is very easy and there are multiple ways to do it and I never had issues being locked out of other content in the game.

---{ Story }---
☐ No Story
☐ Some lore
☑ Average
☐ Good
☐ Lovely
☐ It'll replace your life

Notes: Its your average sonic game story. There is a little heart string tug in there but either you care about it or you don't. I dont think anyone is going into a sonic game thinking its going to win an emmy or anything, but there is enough there to keep you interested but not important enough that if you just want to skip some of it that you wont miss much.

I will say though the new voice actors definitely take getting used to. I liked the SA/SA2 voice acting much better.

---{ Game Time }---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☑ Short
☐ Average
☐ Long
☐ To infinity and beyond

---{ Price }---
☐ It's free!
☐ Worth the price
☑ If it's on sale
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money

Sonic games always drop pretty heavy in price (this in some cases has already been found around 40 bucks). Definitely worth it around 30-40 in my opinion but if there are other games out right now you would rather prioritize, I dont think it will take long for you to get a good deal on this.

---{ Bugs }---
☐ Never heard of
☑ Minor bugs
☐ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

Its sonic

"Dear gaming media and youtube clout chasers.
Yet again you were wrong.

Despite all the attempts to sink this game before it even launched its turned out to be one of the best Sonic games ever. Playing it has brought back the sense of joy and excitement i used to feel as a kid when kneeling on the floor next to my friends gensis.

The visuals and environment is so great. I love the weather and lighting changes that tie in with the incredible score. The sounds of the game are great. The voice acting is great. I just love it all.

And then the actual sonic levels in the portals are all really well realised and offer lots of different variations on the classic and more modern Sonic formula.

For me this is one of the most enjoyable games i have played in quite a long while. Its the first time in a long time i'm already planning a second play-through on the harder difficulty once i finish this first run.",,
"Tails: Rent's due, loser. Let's go. Pay up.

Sonic: Ugh, I'm a little short this month. You know I'm good for it, though, right?

Sonic: ♥♥♥♥ off, I love this poster.

[Sonic looks at his poster.]

Tails: Hey, don't get all pissy with me, cause I'm the one who saved my money, and didn't blow it on coke and Dreamcast stock.

Sonic: You're the one who gave me that stock!

Tails: Th—that's it. Let's not get into all the details about who purposely screwed who out of all their money. The good news is I might be able to hook you up with a couple of jobs to help you get by.

Sonic: [jumps off the couch] Cool! So what do we got? New Sonic game? Sonic cartoon? Sonic Death Metal album? I don't give a ♥♥♥♥. I'll do whatever.

Tails: Well, it's not quite those things...but it's good to know you'll do anything.

"The only way I can recommend this game is if you skip the New Horizons update. The characters do not control well at all in the DLC. They added tight platforming bits, which I normally would love. The controls are so bad that it is a constant struggle against the non-forgivable platforming. I got to the first tower as Sonic, and had to set all of my speed to zero to be able to get through some of the parts of the platforming. This is a Sonic game. We shouldn't have to set the speed to 0 to be able to complete platforming sections because you cannot control the characters properly. Do not recommend.

The base game I had a blast in. I took my time playing through the areas and unlocking everything before proceeding to the next island.",,

"Pros:
*Amazing soundtrack
*Amazing boss fights
*You really can approach this game in multiple ways to finish it, for example I really didn't like the Cyberspace levels, but I was able to complete the game without having to do more than a couple of them in each area. Alternatively someone can go all-in on the cyberspace levels without needing to interact much with fishing if they absolutely cannot stand fishing.
*Character development is surprisingly better than normal, there's hardly anything here that comes off as super cheesy or off-base like in most games.
*The way Sonic grows stronger as you play longer, level up more, and learn new fighting skills ends up being really satisifying.
*I personally loved being able to traverse the land better as I got more familiar with the controls and did some things I thought were cool that may not necessarily have been intentional.

Cons:
*Difficulty imbalance: 1-2 is notoriously ridiculous as a Cyberspace level to get S rank time on for example, but then you'll do 1-3 and it's piss easy maybe even on the first try. Then once in a while you'll have mandatory mini game bits that completely halt the game(and required to progress) and can either be super irritating or legit challenging.
*A lot of exploration bits to open up the map are so mind-numbingly easy that they sometimes fall into ""Hold boost and just wait"" or ""baby's first Simon Says"". There's a ton of them and it's way padded out to what feels like inflate game time.
*There are some issues I would consider in need of QoL polish. Every single time you finish one of these exploration bits, every time you come back from a portal level, you either skip 2-3 cutscenes or have to sit and wait for 20 seconds to be able to move again after a simple moment. Whoever designed it so you can only upgrade rings and speed 1 at a time vs ATK and DEF all at once, PLZ
*Pop in is obviously a bit strange, I am not sure if they did that due to hardware limitations or so that one would need to more thoroughly explore every nook and cranny of a map. It will take some time to learn the layout of a land on the first go.
*To fully understand the final boss, you have to know what the game director said in a game interview regarding the final boss.

This game kind of reminds me of a ""SEGA HIRE THIS MAN"" type of fan project which is kind of weird given this is a real Sonic Team game. The idea crossed my mind while playing on occasion, but I don't think this is a completely bad thing because for how many times I've seen people say they wanted something like that kind of game, this is kind of it. I'm sure people would expect a higher standard than ""fan project"", but this is the first time they've done anything this radically different. It isn't perfect because of some of the unnecessary feeling of padding but to me personally the good was enough to outweigh the annoying parts.


09/01/2023 Edit: Now that the game has been updated with the Final Horizons update, I would still recommend this game on any kind of sale. This game definitely isn't going to be for everyone, but I still had fun with it. It's a bit rough around the edges at full price, so I would advise waiting for a small discount.",,
"Sonic has not been this good in years. The trailer gave me low hopes for the game, but the game itself was actually amazing. The boss fights are the greatest highlight, being incredibly fun, visually stunning, and having amazing music. The open world works very well with sonic, but there are still the run through levels like the normal sonic games that are fun in their own regard. Solid 9.5/10.",,
"I didn't like Nintendo's Mario Odyssey much after beating the game it was very bland and made no point to keep playing> Well imagine my surprise playing this game that it's a lot like Mario Odyssey but better! The story gives you a reason to collect the main collectable plus some, the story is very interesting bringing you back to Sonic Adventures feels. I have yet to beat the game as of writing however I am extremely close to completing it. The only negative I have is that there is a lot of pop-in by a crazy amount however it doesn't take away from much of my enjoyment of the game! 9/10",,
"7/10

If you enjoyed Adventure games and the overall atmosphere and gameplay of the 2000s games, you are likely to have good time. The platforming and speed are fun, there is a lot to explore and to do. Some of the scenes in the game, especially during major boss battles, are few of the most favorite moment for me in the franchise.

HOWEVER,
- 2D platforming in open zone is AWFUL. The constant switching of camera from 3D to 2D is horrible and it was even nausea inducing to me
- Combat needs work. Some of the movements are basically ""press X to win""
- The plot feels to me like different drafts were combined into something that is not very coherent. The ending was major disappointment
- Cyberspace levels are copies of levels from previous games, but also they all have the same four themes
Many of the ideas on paper are GREAT, however, the execution is mediocre. This game definitely needed more time in the oven. Still, I think that the idea of open zone/world is great and I hope that Sonic Team will continue with this concept, because it is lots of fun.",,
Easily the best 3D sonic game. That isn't saying much of anything but this game goes hard. Exploring can get repetitive and being thrown on a rail or boost pad you didn't see gets frustrating but the game never gets boring and the boss fights with their metal music and really fun super sonic gameplay make it worth it.,,

This game is a feast for long time Sonic fans.

Was worth getting all the achievements for.",,
"Product received for free

this is definitely one of the games made of all time
8.7/10
nominated for steam goty!!",,
"One of the best Sonic games made. Wish movements were as fluid as the Sonic Adventure games though. Also, still needs Chao garden",,
THIS GAME IS AWESOME,,
uhh rather fun video game,,
i love when the blue man goes fast,,
"7.5/10. Some parts of it were the best sonic game play I've experienced, and other parts were the worst. I want Sonic Team to continue and refine this style.

The Good:
The OST.
The first 80% of the Story.
The Boss fights.
The first 2 islands and the last one.
When ever Sonic controls well.

The Bad.
The last 20% of the story.
Most of the Cyberspace stages.
The Final Boss.
CHAOS ISLAND
Elder Coco's Upgrades (There are 196 of them and they must be done one at a time.)
Whenever Sonic Just... Breaks.",,
"There is something strange about this game. I bought it, played for a little over an hour and enjoyed myself. I refunded it because I didn't feel like I'd play it much right now and I wanted to dive into the new God Of War. I have NOT been able to stop thinking about this game since I uninstalled it and so I just repurchased it. It is not a perfect game, but there is something about it that makes you want to keep playing and ultimately I think that speaks for itself.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is the next level of Sonics adventure. Its a must have for everyone´s fan of the blue hedgehog. If you are a fan of Jump´n runs, you should consider picking this one up. I have played games of the Sonic franchise since my childhood (23 years ago I played the first Sonic game) and this is the best one Sega has delivered so far.

The pro´s:
- The gameplay is on point. If you are used to Sonics gameplay you will feel comfortable within 30 minutes. Everyone else might need some time to know how to handle him because the game does not explain that much.
- The controls are responsive.
- The graphics are beautiful
- The story, for a Sonic game, is very interesting
- The sense of Speed is incredible. Fast enough to get the Sonic feeling. Slow enough to handle him.
- The mini bosses and the end-bosses are very interesting, unique and everyone has his own style on how to fight them.
- 5 worlds to enjoy and each has its special features.
- The open zones are interesting to discover and the little riddles add up very good to the usual gameplay to settle things down.
- The soundtrack (especially the end-bosses) is amazing

The con´s:
- As beautiful as the graphics are and as much as I praise the art-style. The constant Pop-in´s are annoying. You get the feeling that the streaming engine cannot load fast enough further details because Sonic is to fast. It gets a little bit frustrating if you speed through the open zones and 5 metres before you a jump pad, railway or something else pop´s in that you needed to reach in order to get to another point of the map. It´s sounds worse than it actually is, but you will recognize it. Maybe Sega can patch it later.
- The game should explain more at the beginning. Especially with the controls and moveset of Sonic.
- The menus, they're structure and controlls are not intuitive.
- 60 fps limit
- 16:9 only. You need a little workaround to get 21:9 or greater aspect ratio to work.

I would rate it a solid 8/10.

For the workaround to get greater aspect ratios than 16:9 to work:
- Open the games executable with a Hex-editor. HxD is a good tool for that.
- Search for the Hex value: 39 8E E3 3F
- This value occurs 13 times within the executable.
- In order to get 21:9 resolutions to work without borders you need to replace each 39 8E E3 3F with 26 B4 17 40
- For 32:9 you do the same but replace 39 8E E3 3F with 39 8E 63 40 instead

Keep in mind. Save the original executable in case something goes wrong. In case the game gets a patch, you might need to do the same stuff again. Maybe Sega fixes it later. But who knows they never did it for any other Sonic game.",,

Why does Sonic not simply eat the titans,,
"NO MORE COMPROMISE
THIS IS DO OR DIE
AND NOW YOU CROSSED THE LINE",,
"Only in this game, Sonic can draw amogus",,
"It is a fine game, but man does it need work. The pop-in is rather significant, the combat is fairly lacking for the most part, the Cyberspace stages are just not much fun, and the game progression can be grindy and unbalanced at times, especially in islands 3 & 5. Overall, while an improvement, Sonic has issues with his controls such as losing a lot of momentum if you jump, the boost literally just being a glorified run button, and as previously stated a lackluster combat system that is all style no substance. It is a step in the right direction, with the improvements in story, gameplay, and especially the bosses in comparison to Forces, but I cannot recommend spending $60 on it in its current state.

I suppose a significant part of my gripes is the lack of traditional Sonic design with its emphasis on open world. If you prefer a more stage-by-stage system, get Sonic Generations, which I highly recommend.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is a right step in the direction of where Sonic games need to go. Open-world style just feels right for the blue hedgehog, since now he can run around wherever, being unrestricted by linear level design. The game has a great control scheme, pretty graphics, runs very smooth, and the boost formula has been fixed, for the most part. The game has an unbelievably amazing soundtrack, which is normal for Sonic games. The Cyber-Space levels are little levels that you can enter to collect items crucial for game progression, and they contain throwbacks to prior Sonic games, with amazing music, platforming, and a good challenge. Some issues i have with the game are that the world design isn't perfect, so the world gets repetitive sometimes, and the terrain can sometimes cause Sonic to clip into objects and glitch the world around him. Some Cyber-Space levels are too difficult for their placement in the games' progression stages, and cut-scene facial muscle animation is lagged and difficult to follow. Some text UI is low-poly. These errors are few and far between, though. And with expansion coming in 2023, like new game modes, challenges, features, and a new story, the blue hedgehog isn't done yet. Great job, Sonic Team! Sonic is making a comeback :)",,
"So you don't need to read more, the game is both good and fun in my opinion.From Launch////I liked it, I liked it a lot. It really felt like a new take from sonic that feels more like a proof of concept rather than truly being full, but none the less is a great game to just enjoy my time and run around in on multiple playthroughs and makes for some intriguing challenge runs. Some minor complaints I have are how certain upgrades don't feel too worth like upgrading speed doesn't feel like it boosts me at all in any way, and how no matter how many rings I have, if I don't upgrade my defense I'm gonna drop em all. The overworld is chalk full of room for you to explore what you can do in the space you're given and how you can get collectibles while getting another. At a point it does feel a little tedious getting a bunch of memory tokens when you can just fish them up, but I do hate seeing something on my map I can get rid of by collecting it. The idea of it being sectioned off in a chapter style was odd getting used to, but it's okay, it would be nice to have a post game super sonic to go around the place with being completely OP(reason why it'd be post game). Story was enjoyable, nice to see that they're taking it a bit more serious and making the world more like the people have lived it than just what's happening now, they're characters with memories. Eggman isn't cookie and has a more calming tone, it felt kinda jarring at first, I think they should take more inspiration from the intro of unleashed, but give him more of that menacing flair that the adventure games had, he's the eggman with the master plan, he's got tools that he will use even if he's killing his dignity because his plan has to pull through. The rest are a little mellowed out and just feel more like people. Tails giving a better context for some of the games was cool, knuckles just wanting to be free of his responsibility(he can though, he can shrink the emerald, can't he like back in SA2?) Meta verse is bare bones, but when they either pull a weird level like 3-6, or make something new like 4-4 or 4-8. I will of course talk about the inconsistency that the levels have and how you're faster is some and slower in others, and how sometimes depth perception isn't that great in some. Music slaps like always, another era of sonic music and gameplay it seems to me. They went for a more techno style for the meta verse and they split the rock in the bosses and orchestra in the overworld besides the main song ""I'm Here."" The new beat em up style is cool and I will love to see it refined in future titles. ////The 1st Update////Now to the nitty gritty. The bad stuff in the game post first content update, they haven't fixed the pop in issue that every negative review on this game will not let down. That's the main negative that I see, but I don't have an ultrawide monitor because I think it's pointless, and there isn't an fps cap above 60 which doesn't matter much either.I hate just talking about the bad in a game I enjoy, so let's go over the good stuff. The recent update added two challenge modes for after your first playthrough. Both are rush modes for different things. One is for all of the enemies and bosses and the other is for all of the meta verse levels. Each have you go through each island in their own rush then the final challenge is doing every single one back to back which adds up quickly. In the battle rush it went to ~28 minutes and the meta verse rush going to almost 40 minutes, so it is a huge test of memory about the stages, so take advantage of the ones you're good at to make some good time saves. One REALLY cool thing is that when you do the big challenges you get two things, one is a medal on the menu screen ""similar to stars in FNAF,"" and depending on which one you unlock something extra. The battle rush unlocks extreme mode, an incredibly needed actual hard mode where your rings don't matter and you die in a single hit, in my playthrough so far I haven't gotten to a boss yet, but if it affects there then this will be interesting. As for the meta verse challenge you get to have the power boost that you get in the overworld when you have ring cap, so people that are challenged by 1-2 you have a better chance. Photo mode is what it is, but I don't see myself using it. The jukebox is surprisingly nice and the song choices are pretty good (except that sonic boom isn't on it so it's an L). Jokes aside I love it greatly, but it does give off some GTA 5 phone vibes where you're doing whatever then run into something or off a cliff. Unlocking songs along the way is nice and knowing that they are the same every time is neat, so you can look forward to knowing certain songs are where. Navigating through the songs is weird and would be nicer to do in the pause menu and have the ability to do it in-game could be nice so you don't have to spam the left or up and down to get to a particular song. Edit: So the bosses are effected in the extreme difficulty, so good luck with Giganto and his laser show second phase, just don't do a parry attack and you should be fine. One new thing I noticed was that some meta verse stages are harder to S rank, for example 2-2 used to be 1 minute for an S rank, and now it's 34 seconds, so that small complaint that some had saying it was kinda easy to do now is gone for some of the stages. ////Road map thoughts////I suspect that the next update will be in June. As for the content I would guess there will be time trials to go through areas that feel like stages in each island, a lot on Rhea I would think. The Koco thing I would think is a slight change in that they will have more than just one design on each island. The birthday bash, no idea at all. I will day that end of year on with a new story and *gasp* playable characters. Plural? And how it shows images of the characters in the game, been a while, like a few years? I'm guessing it'll be sequel bait and just show the cast doing what they said they wanted to do, or it will be what they saw before sonic saved them from the meta verse.",,
"Latest update literally ruined the game. They added platforming with 0 leeway to it, made the bosses require perfect timing to beat, take away all of your upgrades, and force you to watch cutscenes you'll have to see hundreds of times before you actually get to the ""final"" boss.

Get your act together SEGA. You're better than this.

If you don't plan to get the Ending for the ""Another Story"" DLC, the game is recommended. If you plan to go all the way for the bonus ending, Youtube it instead.",,
"It's a good sonic game for the first hour or 2, after that it gets very repetitive and boring. It's a great kids game with no challenge but if you're an adult I would say only get this when it's on sale.",,

It has a few issues like the camera and movement
But it was a lot of fun. I like the running, I liked the music, I liked the bosses, I like the speed levels. I liked a lot of it",,
Gameplay might be strange and storytelling is quite confused but the soundtrack is MVP of this game it create such great vibes and atmosphere for these world settings,,
you can fish and grill this is so peak,,
Game is 5/10 at best. Needs major polishing. Button mashing gets infuriating at times. Wait for the sequel…,,
"This game combines two things I like: Open World and Sonic. It's surprisingly satisfying for me to run around and do all the things on the map.
And as always: The music in Sonic games is the absolute best part about it - but this time combined with an overall actual good game. Not all songs can be bangers but the range of ups and downs in the whole OST is astonishing - especially the boss fights.
It has its flaws but like with many games: Nothing a good mod can't fix.",,
"I'll start by saying it's a bit janky, and collection can be tedious, making your hours on this game go very long, but otherwise, very solid game and fun experience, especially with mods enabled. The OST also hits hard with this game.",,
"This is the most 7/10 game I've ever played

Pros

*Fun open world
*An actually non cringy sonic story
*10/10 Voice acting
*10/10 Bosses and music

Cons

*Cyberspace is unnecessary
*Big the cat fishing is too broken (not in a buggy way)
*Boring at points

This game is good and this formula can work for a sonic game but more needs to be added instead of running around in a space",,
The Sonic I know and love is finally back.,,

Good Game. enjoyed it. cant wait till all the free DLC comes out for the 2023 roadmap!,,
Feels great for new and old sonic players alike. but I suggest playing SA1 and 2 first.,,
Amy is still from hot chick heaven. Even though she hasn't aged. Seggggggsssssssss,,
"I really don't have anything to say that hasn't been said already. The game is good. Sonic feels great and while the classic sonic jank is still present, I never felt it took away from my experience. The story is fascinating and I love the direction the writers took each character. The game is full of references to previous titles in a way that for the first time made these games feel connected. Combat has a nice feeling of simplistic but with a large ceiling that allows the player to perform some disgusting DMCesc combos. The boss fights are something else and if you're even contemplating getting this game do not spoil yourself on the boss fights.

SEGA, if there's even a chance you read these. This is good. This is the most fun I've had since adventure 2. Keep working with this.",,
"This is one of the better Sonic games in the past 15 years.

This game is not perfect however, pop-in is horrendous and controls can be very stiff in cyberspace and when you are airborne. The puzzles are pretty lackluster and easy with too much time on the timer so those could be improved. The gameplay loop is repetitive but it never bothered me that much so it didnt impact my play-through. Sadly all the cutscenes are locked to 30fps which makes them jarring to watch and way less smooth and would benefit from 60fps.

Overall this game makes a good attempt at ""open-zone"" there's lots of space to run around, enemies to fight and a solid amount of stuff to do so you wont have a bunch of down time. Running around at high speeds is super fun and finally gives Sonic a bunch of room to stretch his legs and you can drop dash if you inclined which lets you roll around. The enemies can be easy but have certain gimmicks to keep them fresh and varied not allowing you to completely steam roll them.

Soundtrack is great as always and this game is keeping that tradition alive, there are plenty of bops even though most of your time is in the open areas where music is more quiet. The bosses are fun and unique allowing different gimmicks and gameplay styles to shine, paired with amazing music can be a spectacle.

The combat was weird at first but when I got used to it, it was fun chaining attacks together for high damage. Combat is what you make it so if you want to spam one move you can, but I find chains to be more fun and satisfying to pull of than just spamming one move over and over. During big encounters parrying is REQUIRED in select fights so brush up on your timing so you aren't in a loop.

Overall this is a great game and I highly recommend it obviously. It can be rough around the edges but if you can see past some of the flaws there is a great experience here and with some ironing out there is a lot of potential. I look forward to improvements to this formula in the future and I can finally say I have some confidence in Sonic again. 8/10",,
"Now THIS is how you come back to a failing series. Amazing entry in the Sonic franchise, in my opinion up there with the likes of the Sonic Adventure titles for my favorites in the series. Can't recommend more if you love the lil blue guy as much as I do!",,
Very nostalgic and amazing boss battles. I love every second of the game.,,
"As a fan of the boost style sonic games and a fan of general open world platformers, Sonic Frontiers is an easy recommend. The writing for the characters is the best seen in years, and the duology of the platforming sections abd open world roaming creates a fun experience. It has some moments of jank, but when even the jank is fun, it's hard to say there is a bad time to be had. To get the fullest experience, play on hard.",,
Its the most enjoyable sonic experience in a hot minute,,
went to go play again after shower when i got an error message on start up saying denuvo couldn't re-validate game and to try again in 24 hrs,,
Unpolished but they actually made a good sonic game so that is cool,,
"I'm genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed this.

It's very janky, and definitely a bit messy, but still pretty fun. Not a big fan of the cyberspace levels, especially since the remakes of old levels just feel lazy, but a few of them are fine. The islands are fun to explore, aside from island 3 which relies way too heavily on 2D segments that you all too often end up getting stuck in by accident. There are also some genre switch-ups that can be a bit of a pain, but didn't detract too much from the game for me. The fishing minigame is the highlight and oddly enough the most efficient way to level up your speed, power, defense, and rings. Apparently Big the Cat is hiding his power level and his fishing coins are the most valuable currency in the Sonic universe.

Combat is pretty brain dead, but still enjoyable. Both the major bosses and the overworld bosses are a mixed bag. Some are good, some are painfully unfun. Luckily, other than the titan fights, you can easily ignore them if you want.

This also has the best characterization of the Sonic cast for well over a decade. Baldy McNosehair writing is no more, and characters can finally have some development again and interact with each other like actual characters instead of stereotypes.

It's not a great game, in fact I'd say it's just barely above average, but a welcome step in the right direction for the franchise. I just hope they can keep it up and Sega gives Sonic Team more of a budget to work with.",,
"Product received for free

It's aight",,
pls sega let sonic team do more of this,,
We finally got a good one lads,,
trghftrtrgy,,
its good,,
"the most fun i've had with a sonic game in years. it's not perfect-- hell, it's far from, but i can look past all of its shortcomings to see the passion that went into making this game what it is. absolutely worth the money and time if you've missed what sonic used to be from a writing and spectacle standpoint like i have.",,
"Very flawed, but still the best 3D Sonic game in a decade.
Best of all? It provides an experience you can't get from any other Sonic game.
So yeah, I'd say it's worth it.",,
Game is ♥♥♥♥ but I had fun playing around with it,,
This game has the perfect amount of jank to be an amazing Sonic game,,
Big the cat is peak.,,
"If you want to get back into sonic game, perfect time for sure.",,
the game tried way to hard for the dramatic that it failed to capitalize on gameplay opportunities like multiplayer COME ON OPEN WORLD SONIC AND THEY DON'T CAPITALIZE ON IT?! ONCE AGAIN LEAVE IT TO THE FANS TO FIX THE ♥♥♥♥ UPS SEGA MAKES.....,,
"I'd love to see this more fleshed out, side quests/possibly more playable characters, my biggest gripe is I feel like a game like this needs a NG+ to make getting the rest of the achievements easier to get, combo cracherjack is impossible with max stats unless you farm the final boss like I did. Either way i'm very 50/50 on if this game was worth the $60 title. as a sonic fan I can justify 60, but if the open zone is more fleshed out in a frontiers 2 or other title I would probably buy it.

♥♥♥♥ you valve adding this for my tasks for steam awards

TL;DR sonic team dub for long time fans, would hope they keep momentum with next title, need more content if I can 100% in 30 hours.",,
"Overall Its got the right Idea but there's some really flawed ideas.

Bad points:
- Puzzles feel boring/ tedious
- Sections of the game you have to collect things which isn't bad but if you don't open the map gg's finding all the little hearts for Amy.
- Controls can feel really janky sometimes when you're running up walls you can hit the edges real easy and just go barreling back down to start again.
- Graphics sometimes took a solid poop rain looks like crap...Like REALLY bad.

Good points:
-Watching sonic run and being able to pan the camera around him freely feels really nice its cool seeing him from all angles
-While the controls ARE clunky running in open fields feels very satisfying
- The boss fights for as far as I got in the game were really interesting some of them had that same clunky mechanic though.
-Its a sonic game thats pushing a new narrative

Overall:
If you're looking for a sonic game that contains silver or shadow or any of the other characters this is not it, you can only play as sonic. The game is fine and I dont know how to describe it other than ""Its not a $60 game"" its more like a $40. I hope they improve upon this though in the future it just feels very rushed and poor",,
"In my opinion, this is the best sonic game. Controversial, sure but seeing how SEGA has just the worst rep when it comes to their OWN franchise, this is leagues better than what they've made in recent years.
Its got those classic SEGA bugs, sure but man. The open world, the cyberspace levels, it's all amazing. I'd def give this to any sonic fan.",,
"Wanted to leave a review for the final DLC since I think this is something that people will be a bit polarized on.

The biggest issue with the DLC is that it tells you literally nothing about how to progress in it, and Knuckles has somewhat finicky controls while gliding. Amy, Knuckles and Tails start off super weak and have to level up and get skills again. You can get skill points by talking to color coded coco which can let you quickly get abiltiies -- you'll want to prioritize their new quick cyloop equivalents as these are needed for certain sections with purple chest signposts. Amy has a triple jump and a glide, Tails has a triple jump into vertical ascent and can then hover at whatever level he wants but can't ascend again until he resets his counter by landing or with certain obstacles, iirc. Both of these characters take some getting used to but are quite fun to control and feel suitable for their challenges. Knuckles needed to be a bit easier with his glide. As it is you triple jump to glide, but the glide is very fast and controls with tank controls. It's the sort of thing you'll want to line up your glide shot perfectly and then execute -- there are some spots where the game asks you to do bendy glide paths and this is pretty difficult.

The Sonic sections are where the bulk of the difficulty is. You'll have to climb 5 trial towers, like in the base game, except now they're absolutely cracked, punishing and will 100% filter you at least once or twice. That said, the towers are not quite as hard as they appear. You can use sonic's infinite midair parry to save yourself from a fall, and can l and r dash through the air and hold parry to get a breather, line up your camera to a homing target, etc, to avoid having to repeat the whole tower if you fail. Most of the towers, if you take things slow and stead and plan out your approach are not excessively difficult, but each tower has a couple of ""hard spots"" where it just asks for precise skill and doesn't really reward taking it slow and steady as much. Don't be afraid to try Easy, which adds additional homing targets that can make most of the very difficult sections a breeze though. I would recommend putting physics controls back to their defaults too (in fact, iirc the non-sonic characters control very badly with stuff that isn't defaults). Imo these towers are pretty great, but would have benefited a ton from having, say, 2 or 3 checkpoints along the way, even if only on lower difficulties.

At the top of each tower you have to do a combat challenge and these are probably the most frustrating parts of the DLC. There are youtube video guides for each of them, and I recommend just looking them up.

The difficulty level of the DLC on Normal and Hard is far above anything in the base game. It demands precision platforming and automates far, far less of the platforming for the player. Sonic hasn't really experimented with genuinely difficult content since perhaps the Sonic Unleashed DLC, and a lot of this design, especially the cyberspace levels, feels reminiscent of that. There will be some growing pains and I think it was a mistake to not have a normal difficulty that isn't as automated as easy but moreso than hard, and especially to make this part of the critical path for the new ending versus extra bonus stuff (though there is new cyberspace too, and these levels are both fantastic and extremely difficult).

I get why people are a bit sour on the return of Sonic's friends as they're handled here, but I think there's a lot of good ideas that I hope Sonic Team capitalizes on in the future on their next game. It's been a fun ride, watching the iteration on a kinda weird and proof-of-concept-ish base game into something where you can really start to see the potential the the future of the series start to come through.",,
SONIC PEAKTIERS,,
The best 3D Sonic - ever,,
Best straight 24 hours of my life.,,
"Play it for the Boss fights alone

the rest of the game is good but THE BOSS FIGHTS MAN",,
"This game genuinely feels like Sonic Team did their best to make something worth your time. It's far from perfect, but if you're able to look past some of the jank there's an absolute gem to be found here.",,

"Lots of fun so far, just great to move around in. Challenging but fair bosses and the cyberspace sections are chefs kiss. A great step forward for the franchise. Some people are apparently having technical issues but I can't speak to that since I haven't encountered any.

Edit: Upon finishing the game my overall opinion is about the same. It stays pretty consistently fun and varied throughout. I was surprised by how much I ended up enjoying the combat, which is pretty much always just a chore in sonic games. The bosses genuinely just get better and better and there were far more types then I expected. There are definitely 2 low points in the game, the final boss(the hard mode only one) and traversal in the 3rd Zone but it's not all bad even at those points.",,
"So I think the game is a lot fun and gets various things that previous 3D Sonic games didn't do right or just missed the mark. However Sonic Team seem to still be riding the high of Sonic Generations by adding old levels, except all the levels that you recognize either from Sonic Generation or Sonic Adventure 1 and 2 now just look really bad because they either use Green Hill, Chemical Plant, or Sky sanctuary. Which makes me wish they actually redid the textures for the old games and actually made the levels look how they were supposed to rather how they're supposed to play. Even then the stages themselves play really stiff and slow and feel like there's too long of a delay before you can actually do another button press. This is especially prevalent in 2D sections where I don't why they can't recreate how 2D sections are supposed to feel, but they just can't and they always feel slow and clunky now.
However the main strength and the place where you will spending a majority of your time is in the over world and that plays and feels really good. It reminds of BOTW if you were fast. However it does make a lot collectibles on these floating platforms that sometimes I have no idea how to get up to them. So I either run around until I find something that looks like is the way up or I just hope I can ramp off of something and boost up to the platform.",,
"Sonic Fishing Simulator 2022. Is the best sonic fishing simulator I have ever played. I like the fact that Sonic can fish, and catch a variety of fish, by grabbing on to Big the Cats Rod. The rest of the game is pretty cool too!",,
"Honestly, what a nothing burger kind of game. The story was overall pretty meh and disappointing. But the gameplay was fun and entertaining, so It's worth a play just for that.
Just personally the story left so much to be desired and seemed to be written in a rush or just poorly.
Give it a try and form your own opinion. If nothing else you'll have fun running around.",,
"is there jank in this game? yes, quite a lot.
could things have been done better? certainly.
but this is easily one of the BEST 3d sonic games;
it captures elements and feelings that haven't really been present since Sonic Adventure one, the gameplay is fun and fluid (especially if you unlock the spin dash from the 2nd update)
and for the first time in almost 20 years the characters feel like characters instead of caricatures.
i'm immensely looking forward to update 3 and any future ""open zone"" style sonic games and anyone with even a passing fondness for the blue blur stands to gain for picking this up.",,
"I don't even know how to start this review since I have so many mixed feelings about this game, so I'm gonna start with a TL;DR

Sonic Frontiers is a fun game that I can't recommend

The game has a lot of design decisions that I don't gel with: the Open Zones quickly become annoying and tedious, the cyberspace levels are mid at best with awful controls, I got a lot of weird bugs and glitches, the combat was ok at best, getting the S ranks was a joke, the game feels like it has almost no replay value due to its structure, and some of the enemies got on my nerves due to the game focusing on them despite you wanting nothing to to with them at the time.

And yet moving aroud with Sonic in the environment has never been so much fun, the bossfights got me giggling in excitement like a 10 year old child, the music is great, chaining the mini challenges for the memory tokens was fun, and the fact that Sonic Team is this close to finding a really good Sonic formula is commendable in of itself.

It lacks a lot of polish and I have some hope that the next game will be good since they actually said they want this to be the blueprint for future games, but since this is Sonic Team we're talking about there is always the chance of them dropping the ball, alas.

In the meantime if you REALLY want to play it honestly wait for a discount and get a physics mod.",,
One of the best Sonic games ever made. It has made a million strides for the future of the Sonic franchise. Simply an epic game. Also it has one of my favorite fishing minigames ever.,,
ill do a more detailed review when i completed it but initial impressions are this is a very good sonic game with amazing music,,
Best sonic game,,
"This game is filled with horrible design flaws, especially in the DLC.

The DLC made me go from ""this game is mid"" to ""this game is just bad""

It's such a waste of time I don't even care about the super sonic thing at the end, which is supposed to be the coolest thing in these games.",,
"After the abysmal era of comedy garbage and out of character nonsense, Sonic finally feels like he's Sonic again. Everyone feels like themselves again. This doesn't feel like a 2000s game entirely; more like the 2000s and Unleashed had a baby. Best Sonic game since the 2000s. Hopefully they continue like this, keep using Flynn, and ignore the garbage of the 2010s.",,
"-Story 10/10
-Music 10/10
-Graphics 8/10
(Would say 10, but felt like it could enhanced just a tad more)
-Controls 6/10
-Level Designs 9/10

One of my favorite Sonic games I've played as of recent. Originally bought this on the switch and boy howdy are the graphics terrible on that compared to the pc version here. 100% recommend playing the pc or playstation version as graphics matter for this game if you want a quality experience.
The game play and controls feel fresh for the series with the breath of the wild open world aspect and never felt repetitive or boring at any point. Reminded me a lot of Sonic Adventure playing this tbh.
Brilliant story! Was not expecting this game to be so real and packed with emotion for how short the game felt.
Control wise for how Sonic moves was pretty frustrating though at least for me. Less the controls and more of the horrid random locking camera angles that would make you fly the opposite direction from your intended route. Unfortunately had a lot of moments where I'd have to go at a snails pace for obstacles so I wouldn't randomly fly off. Other than those moments, zooming around at full speed and flying off objects with such force is such a joy in this game!
Enemies felt new and challenging enough fighting which was great Bosses felt well balanced and more difficult as you progress the story.

Overall statement - Play the game. Is good",,
"Annoying camera, annoying controls, tedious gameplay loop.
Also, just SO many terrible quality of life things; Like upgrading your speed one bit at a time with a long annoying cutscene.
On that note: if you like annoying cutscenes, you'll love this game.

10/10 better than Forces

Seriously tho, I refunded. I'll wait until it's on sale or modded.
Recommended when on sale.",,
"It honestly feels like in each and every game Sonic controls worse. The Cyberspace stages and islands control differently from one another, but in both Sonic feels more rigid in movement than any platformer I have played in years. Homing attacks, light speed dashes, and even boosting in air causes you to lose all your previous momentum. I shouldn't need a bunch of different sliders in the menu to make my character control slightly okay.

That said it's a step up from Forces. The writing takes itself more seriously in a good way but it still doesn't hit the correct tone from the adventure era.",,
I'm Sonic.,,
"Easily the best 3D Sonic game since Generations. There is some jank, but Sonic Team has a really solid foundation with this game. If the kinks are to be ironed out, we could have something very special in the future.",,
i love sonic,,
"Not a phenomenal game by any means, but a great next step in a series that's felt directionless the past several years.",,
bad,,
The best Sonic game by far and The Final Horizon update is the icing on the cake. Hopefully Sega recognises this success and will make future Sonic games at least as good as Frontiers.,,
"I absolutely love this game so far, and now definitely up there with one of my favorite Sonic games.. I haven’t played sonic since Sonic Generations! So I’m really happy that I picked this up.

It definitely hits the hardcore fans who played the other games and hell they even threw In references to the adventure games! This game is well worth your time, there’s a lot to do and things to discover!

Go pick this up!",,
"Product received for free

I got this game for free through a Qooapp giveaway! Lucky me!
However, I have not played it much yet and I am not a huge fan of Sonic games, but still, this game is really good; I love how it can bring back some of my childhood memories with Sonic animation series, games like Sonic Werehog, Sonic Boom, and so on.",,
"Game was so good that I actually wanted to 100% it. My only complaints are that momentum is just non-existent and sonic handles like ♥♥♥♥ in cyberspace missions HOWEVER, both of these things can be fixed with one mod. The soundtrack is an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ banger. overall 10/10",,
"Gameplay is basically what people have wanted from Sonic for years. Story is a breath of fresh air. The biggest mark against it is it's clear the budget was tight, but there's genuine gold in here.
Sonic Team have picked themselves up and dusted themselves off, and released a good game for a change. The singular glaring issue with the game is severe amounts of pop-in in the open zones which is something you'll be seeing a lot as you race across them; but that's about it. Praying we don't need to wait another decade for the next good game.
Also, Eggman is a good father.",,
"Overall it's fun game, however I wouldn't say it was a solid experience. First the graphics are alright, not mind blowing but serviceable enough. The story of the game is pretty, good, not super convoluted, but allows for some nice and more organic interactions between the characters, along with some pretty nice character development for Eggman, fleshing his character out a bit more, to the point I actually sympathized with him towards the end a bit.

The gameplay is where things get dicey. On one hand Sonic in the overworld feels great, never had too much problem with him once I tweaked the settings in the menu. Yes, you can tweak Sonic's gameplay, such as top speed, turning speed and starting speed, in the menu which I highly recommend to customize it to your playstyle.

That said, it's the cyberspace missions that caused me the most issues. Biggest complaint is the automatic camera which snaps to the direction the developers felt was the optimal view based on where you are in the level, however it throws Sonic's orientation off when the camera snaps to a different angle which caused me to fall off platforms several times and worse it disable all manual camera control. Luckily cyberspace missions are optional and you can pick and choose which cyberspace missions you are willing to complete. By the end, I avoided most of them and just grabbed items I needed from the overworld and through fishing. Also, 2D sections return which also frustrated me a bit, they just felt so shoehorned, like Sega was just crossing off a checkmark, not only that but they are implemented into the overworld as well which caused Sonic to lock at points to a 2D plane. I am stilling trying to figure out why they keep putting 2D sections in, since game is clearly no designed for the ground up for them, nor does it add anything of real value.

Despite having to put up with some of Sonic Team's BS, it's the first Sonic game I have finished in awhile, and it kept me invested throughout even with the glaring problems.",,
"Could be better, could be worse. There's more good than bad, though.",,
"Very much do not understand the hype of this at all. It's a bunch of micro-games held together with the gimmick of a fairly empty open world level, and the occasional mini-level dotted around in there.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is a plainly good game in my opinion. Balanced out by great things and bad things.

The greatest aspect about it is the new format that breaks the mold of the old level format. Sonic can now freely move around huge worlds at his own pace. The movement in these open zones are awesome, responsive, and expressive. You can utilize Sonic's speed with his surroundings, rails, and bumpers to go to places with skill. Though sometimes as you run along the ground, the littlest piece of a rock or a steep ramp can send you flying, or straight down towards it like a magnet. This is sometimes annoying when you trying to cy-loop something at fast speeds.

The structure of the game's open zones starts at a high point in terms of quality. Exploring Kronos island (The first one) is a blast as you are brand new into the swing of things. Fighting the big guardians, collecting the memory tokens, puzzles to open up the map piece by piece, and entering cyberspace is a blast. When you arrive to the second island, it expands with WAY more scope, bigger guardians, and many ruins to dive into it. But by the the third island, the structure becomes stale and feels like a chore doing the same thing. The island themes don't help with this as they are based on realistic environments that sometimes blend together. I liked the fact that the 4th island is kinda of a different beast all together with it's story focus, but it's short lived. And by the 5th island, you doing the same things over again. You stop caring about fighting every guardian or collecting every token. I just wish they was more meaningful things to do on the island. It feels bare bones, the more you do it. This is by far the biggest issue for me with this game.

With that said, I do like the fact that they try to spice things up consistently trough out with small changes to puzzles, enemy variety, and some of the big platforming structures among the sky.

Combat is okay at best. The highlight of combat is by far, fighting the guardians and titans. Each one have some unique little challenge to overcome. Though not all of the guardians are created equal, some of them are pretty lazy with QTEs and blandness just on par with a normal foe. The titans fights though is where it really shines. Each one has amazing high spirit pumping music, HUGE scale fights with a titans 100X bigger then you. It feels great overcoming these big foes. Though these fights are held down by the fact combat is pretty bland and easy to do. I played on the hard difficulty and dealing damage to these guys was pretty easy. Doesn't help that the parry does not require skill of timing at all and can be held down for a long time before you let go. Making the fights even more easy.

Some of the unique abilities you acquire are fun to use against them. The highlight being the new cy-loop ability. By running around them and trapping them in you're trail, you can stun foes for combo starters. This move is also used for some puzzles which is alright. After fighting some of them you can also gain XP to unlock some more moves to help deal more damage in a combo which is alright. The skill tree is not big so you will get every move before the game ends.

Also scattered throughout the journey is some items that you can use to upgrade Sonic's damage, defense, ring count, and speed. Which is really nice, expect the fact that if you want to upgrade sonic's speed and ring count, you have to upgrade them one level at a time. It takes forever to upgrade these, compare to the damage and defense ones which takes all of the items at once and upgrades multiple levels at a time. Straight up took me an half in hour to upgrade my speed from lvl 53 to max. So annoying.

Cyberspace plays like more of a traditional sonic level. Point A to B, multiple pathways and such. The worst thing about them is that Sonic controls terribly in cyberspace, compared to the open zone. Turning around curvy turns is slow and wonky, you will bump into the wall or fall off. Also the fact that a majority of them use level designs from past game could be a great disappointment to those who would prefer something completely original. It also doesn't help that cyberspace has only four themes, which in turn makes them less memorable or something to not look forward to. With that said though, the best thing about cyberspace is the replayability. Exploring every unique route and finding the best ones to save time is a blast and is my personal highlight of the game. Racing for faster times is a joy (If you get use to the bad control of it like I did) It helps that the music in these cyberspace levels are great and have plenty variety to the sounds.

The story and characters are fine. The best thing about it is that it finally brings up the lore from past games and brings it up to speed with this one. No longer are modern sonic games feel like one shot stories, but instead, a mainline series. Character interactions between each other feels like real character that are true to the ones from 10-15 years ago. I really liked unlocking some of the side cut scenes to see how they played out. Though I do kinda wish Sage character was handled better. Her arc in this game is really slow, and you're conversations with her are always kinda the same. But she abruptly changes for the better around island three and doesn't feel earned at all. Though I do like the dynamic between her and Egg man in some cut scenes and the audio logs you can find by fishing. It really shows the bright side in egg man's character and the way in which he sees Sage is pretty cute.

One last thing I want to point out is that Big the Cat is back for this game. He brings a pretty chill, simple fishing mini game with him and is another personal highlight of mine. You can catch plenty of detailed fish and collect currency to buy in his shop. You can get pretty OP pretty easily thanks to big's shop. The music, the vibes, the simplicity is quite great with him. Please bring Big the Cat in more games please.

Overall Sonic Frontiers shows a lot of promise for the future of the series. With a pretty fine addition of the open zones, mixed in with traditional levels, and lore from past games is great. I do hope they learn from the mistakes of this game to make the open zones a little more engaging and meaningful throughout. As well tightening up the challenge of the combat and adding originality to linear levels. Sonic has pretty solid foundation in the modern gaming space to succeed. Was this game a success? I want to say yes, but it's held down by ideas that could be better for a first attempt at this type of style. The passion of the developers does shine trough for me in some areas to make it worth it for me. If you are looking for an interesting and unique experience with Sonic, this is it. If you are on the fence on getting this game, it would be wise to wait for a sale if you are not feeling to sure.

I'm gonna be blunt. Update 3 has officially made me not like Sonic anymore. This game's controls and physics seemed fine early on but become insufferable in the late game. Climbing the 10 different towers this game demands of you between the base game and Update 3 is soul crushingly frustrating.",,
"Unironically the best Sonic game in at least a decade. The story is great, the stages are fun, the bosses are sick as hell. Combat is a nice change of pace and still feels appropriately fast.

9.5/10",,
"I have no idea who is writing these positive reviews.

The game's hardware performance is atrocious. It struggles to hit 40-50 FPS and the weird high-poly photorealism is jarring in contrast with Sonic as the main character. Even for a game that's been in development hell since 2017 (Sonic Team admits this) the texture quality and render distance are really lacking. The camera work is blatantly unfinished, causing gameplay issues with locking on to enemies and epilepsy warnings every time a collectible spawns. Unsurprisingly, it's visually similar to Breath of the Wild, a 6-year-old game for a very underpowered console, but that level of fidelity doesn't make the grade on PC or PS5 in 2023.

The voice-acting and """"""""""plot"""""""""" are the worst. If you're buying this game for Sonic characters, don't. They managed to make Mike Pollock's Eggman sound dull and lifeless which is a once-in-a-lifetime achievement. I don't know what happened to Cindy Robinson's Amy but I do know that she said she was retiring from the project and her quick return is very obvious from Amy's voice lines, words slurred together in a pitch that's too low for the character. The intro cutscene is ninety seconds long so the game can hit you with 30 minutes of tutorial text boxes (unanimated, unvoiced, flat, lifeless text boxes! As a tutorial for your 2022 PLATFORMER!) that contain *grammar and syntax errors*. Even the name ""Cyber Space"" feels like a syntax error every time I look at it. Is that really the best worldbuilding they could have come up with? ""Cyber Space""? The world of Sonic Frontiers feels like a shoddy rip-off of Code Lyoko and that's an insult to Code Lyoko.

Every single non-Sonic thing in this game feels like a straight asset rip from a canceled open-world game that Sega just happened to have rotting in a storeroom hard drive. Nothing about the game feels like Sonic except for a couple of cheesy Green Hill textures for fanservice. Even the Saturday-Morning-Cartoon-y voice acting and animation, basically the only reason people continue to put up with this franchise, is missing. The generic 'creepy robot' enemies, a mishmash of tropes from the last few 3D Zelda games, fit exceptionally poorly into the world of Sonic. Hilariously, though, they look very similar to the robot enemies in Sonic '06. I don't know how Sonic Team remains this blissfully unaware of how inconsistent their own product is. They keep putting out half-baked ideas on half-baked code and expecting a full paycheck.

Maybe Sonic should've stayed in the 90s 'til Sega were ready to put him in something finished and polished. At least Crash Bandicoot still has his dignity.",,
"Needed more time in the oven, looks like an xbox 360 game that wasn't finished.

It is addictive and can be plenty of fun but it is not worth the buckaroos. If its supposed to be a good foundation for the following games then I would rather wait for the sequels to come out if they will ever exist. This game however, nah. You can just run in circles to get infinite coins and XP, which it pretty much encouraged during boss fights if you run out of rings to just run in a quick little circle and get health back.

The pop in is some of the worst ive ever seen in a game, I keep seeing levitating assets in the air and not knowing how to reach them, until i walk 3 paces forward and the rest of it loads. Enemies are extremely janky to fight, you can just hold parry in midair until you are blue in the face and you will both not get punished for it and also just levitate forever its actually hilarious.

The best part about this game is when you get max rings and your movement is increased in the open world, you get this cool blue trail and you go insanely fast like how you see in the cartoons, its awesome. Until you realize it isn't really practical, you cant do it during the minute long stages, doing it during boss fights feels awkward, or impossible for some reason...like they disable your movement speed boost sometimes, its just...a cool thing to do. I maxed all the speed bars (They made speed bars to adjust your movement spoeed I guess for accessibility...? I cant tell you the reason honestly its weird) which made movement really neat when running, you can basically rotate the left stick as fast as you want and sonic will turn perfectly (makes the running in circles for infinite money +XP + upgrades really easy)

For some odd reason your boost buttons movement speed is pathetic at certain times like in the stage segments. It also doesn't activate all the time, or sometimes it'll cut off during a straight away despite me having meter. It just is not satisfying at all compared to sonic generations where boosting makes you freaking ZOOM. Plus doing homing dashes and most actions have insane end-lag, making doing the speed challenges frustrating. For example beginning of stages doesn't properly tell you when you have control, so it can be difficult to get a good start unless you spam the boost button (cause holding it down wont work until AFTER you have control). Hitting enemies, ziplines, rails, the...zoom red ring things, these all take away control or even freeze you in place for a second or two. Doing speed challenges with this handicap is silly and its faster to just awkwardly skip things, despite it being lined up perfectly for you, its just faster to skip to avoid constant micro-animation hell.

The combat upgrades are...neat...I guess. though they aren't super impressive its easiest to just run in circles for an hour, obtain all of your upgrades, and just play the game like that. There is no reason to hold the upgradeable moves behind an XP progression its just nonsense they don't impact anything and aren't that interesting, and again...run in circles while using the trail move. Not sure why they would let you do that, but i'm grateful because it gets passed their silly XP and HP system. Its like drinking an estus in dark souls. But uh...with drawing a circle instead. :p

The most fun thing this game has is exploring, they set up many little jungle jims which require some pretty precise inputs to get through, which is the most fun I have out of this. Seriously they are everywhere. the boss fights are pretty cool aside from being mechanically janky, they have some big chunky robots in this that look pretty neat.

Man...don't know what the game design goals were for this game, its crazy, they had something going but it just feels incredibly unfinished, it had me hooked for a few minutes until I realized that what i've played so far was the ""meat"" of the game, and it wouldn't change much from there.

The story is rushed, barely explained, tries to be mysterious with lack of context for everything, your plane crashes with tails and amy then suddenly they are...captured...off screen? Magic voice tells you you're the chosen one and you gotta do X and sonic just goes ""uhh k i guess"". Mysterious chibi chick watches you for a while in cut scenes which I think is a kink for Japanese companies to do, and when you meet her shes a ♥♥♥♥ to you even though you are just tryin to save your homies. Idk man...who cares. Sonic adventure stories were the best sonic has.
Sonic barely shows personality, and I think his voice actor was sick or something, he has this deep voice which I just cant connect to speedy hedgehog big sneaker man.

Id probly buy this again for $15 if it ever goes on sale for that much. Hopefully a sequel or two will feel more fleshed out. You might enjoy this game, if you love sonic you wont care for the quirks this game has. Its just too expensive for me to justify a purchase. Just play sonic generations it even looks prettier.",,

"A good game, but may be tough to warrant the price point.
--

TL;DR: The game is amazing in its own right, but the lack of replay value and short playthrough makes it tough to recommend anyone who is not already a Sonic fan OR you are looking for exactly a short and sweet game to play through.

Sonic Frontiers is really great and an absolute blast while I played!
The gameplay itself feels very experimental but you can see that it takes most of the cues from other games that have been out in recent days.
The skill tree system is highly simplistic to the point that you may question why it's even a thing,
The environments and the atmosphere of the music gives a feeling very reminiscent of Legend of Zelda's Breath of the Wild.
Especially the music, it is very dynamic and it can elevate the gameplay to motivate and empower you during tense story moments, but the ""Cyberspace"" sections of the game give you loud bangers to jam off to.

The people would have you believe that it's ""open-world"" up until the game's release but rather you are given a few isolated playgrounds to explore yourself and make use of Sonic's new controls compared to earlier games.
In these playgrounds are also small time attack levels that you can go to where it can reference levels from previous Sonic games, just with different assets. For example, they throw you into the very first ""Cyberspace"" level which is immediately after you press New Game, the level is inspired by 1-1 of Windmill Isle from Sonic Unleashed.

They've tried their best to implement a good chunk of his moveset across past games and since you have to go off of these previous games, they can feel incredibly nerfed or clunky.
For example, the Drop Dash. It gives you a huge boost of speed as you touch ground, BUT -- you end up fixed in rolling in a straight line with very little control over tilting until you jump (which kills your momentum). Compare that to Sonic Lost World where you had much more control over where it goes and can even chain multiple Drop Dashes seamlessly!

In older games, Sonic was practically friction-less and his moves were... snappy. To some extent you would perform a move and still keep moving making him actually hard to control if you want to keep him in one spot.

In here, they finally toned down Sonic so that he can actually stay still, not to mention you have a bit more time to consider his moves. As a result though he can appear a bit slower. However, when you get good with momentum then he can appear relatively fast to your eyes.
However, in ""Cyberspace"" levels he can feel even slower than when in the aforementioned open playgrounds of the main game. It takes awhile to get used to these two different forms of Sonic, but it can feel very rewarding to get the hang of both.


Aside from Sonic himself, I consider the game to be a great and big experience going through the Story as well as the game with these new physics.
However, it is hard to really recommend it to someone at full price. There's one reason for this.
My review time should say 16.2 hours of play. In that time span, I have 100% the game (not including achievements).
100%ing the game is VERY easy and not hard. Hard Mode is not hard.

The game does not have any replay value or any mechanics to help with this either.
You can only hope there may be additional DLC to the game but for $60, you get this 16 hour experience, maybe even less if you don't 100% it.
◽ There is no New Game+ -- once you finish the game, the only thing you can do with your save file is start a new game.
◽ There is no Boss Rush, so you can't tackle the bosses in one go.
◽ There is no harder difficulty past Hard Mode, even after game completion.

This makes it VERY difficult to recommend the game if you're on a tight budget and only I can if you are a big fan of the Blue Hedgehog himself.
As someone who really only played his games, and honestly not too many as of late (I only played a little bit of Lost World, didn't touch Forces, Played Colors but not the Ultimate version) and have not seen his comic iterations, the story will take a turn that is VERY different but very welcome change to his usual care-free, borderline invulnerable self.

If there's one thing that this game does, is it allows people to not only enjoy this game, but be also hopeful that they take the formula here and build upon and improve it for the next game.",,
"WOW! It's good, sort of has an Elden Ring / BOTW type vibe in terms of design but no full on and everything just works and I feel like it is going to end up being a gem. If you ever remembered playing Sonic Adventure on the Dreamcast for the 1st time... well this captures that magic and shock value of something fresh and new for the Sonic IP and will basically have you saying ""feels good man"" and have the Antonio Banderas Assassins laptop scene on repeat.

Seriously if you at all love 3D platformers and Sonic this is a must buy and play this year and so far it is pretty amazing! I must play more, also set the difficulty to MAX and turn off all the aids to give more of that Elden Ring type vibe once you get the hang of all the mechanics cause there is a lot of them(run the tutorial a few times, just check out the shrine at the start)!

Damn.... this is something else and it even looks really nice on the PC, MAX'ed out @ 4K and 60FPS! Also the controls are insanely tight, smooth and responsive and you always get top do what you want and things don't bug out. The music score is even really good and there are a truck load of options for you to mess around with so check that out as well. I am really blown away at how well Sonic controls and feels it's easily the best feeling 3D Sonic to date and the world feels really nice and is well designed.

Update: more cool things to note, there is a day and night cycle which has dynamic lighting and a weather system. The combat and skills are really nice and feel really good in the open world part of the game. There are also normal 3D Sonic Generation type levels that have to do with unlocking stuff it's a cool touch and those levels look and play really well. Keep playing till it tells you you can now free roam, at that point you should be fully impressed and go damn this is sick. Love it, the hype is real.",,
"This is the best Sonic game i have ever played.
Its easy to pick up,fast and relaxed ,yes!!! i say relaxed as there are tranquil moments with piano music (crazy for a sonic game,right!!!)
Dont listen to the paid you tubers saying negative stuff about this game ,check it out and have fun.....as it really is that!!",,
"The first good Sonic since SA2? Worth getting.

UPDATE:
Originally played on a Win11 machine, which is where the problems below were found. Ryzen 5, 8gb ddr5, 3060 laptop GPU.

I've now played the game on my Win10 machine, i7, 16gb ddr4, 1080 8gb desktop GPU. Game launches in fullscreen by default and is extremely well optimized. Crashing issue also did not occur on this machine.

Don't know wtf the issue is between the devices, but the criticisms below are for my laptop with the specs listed above. On the desktop listed above, zero issues and the game is incredible for Sonic fans.

OG Post:
Though PC port seems kinda ♥♥♥♥. Entering the graphics settings crashes the game and I can't find a way to set it in fullscreen, even with Alt+Enter. Some weird framerate stuff during a short cutscene once. They'll patch it out..... I hope.",,

Other than that, it's the best Sonic game since Generations",,
"Product received for free

Ever since the 3rd update rolled. Frontiers hasn't been able to run on my Laptop AMD radeon, because its ""weak"". Still though, the 3rd update KICKED ASS, its probably buggy, but scenic and hard, also please. fix that, or delete the check. if a switch can run it, my laptop can.",,
"There's also massive glitches that are not just due to Denuvo but seemingly from a rushed game, graphical glitches and gameplay bugs as well as massive framerate dips (mostly due to alt-tabbing, most likely my fault)

There is also some stutters which i assume is due to Denuvo. This is disappointing as i've wanted to like this game but all of these make the experience completely unplayable and unfun.

(and yes my PC does meet the specs)",,
"This game right here, is the best Sonic game to date. It blows Generations and Adventure 2 out of the water, the controls are smooth as butter, the visuals are top notch, the story is the best it's ever been, and the music, it's just beautiful.

Good game. Fun but not sure if its worth the price. Only thing I hate is leveling up speed and coins because it takes too long.,,
Recommended to those who are truly sonic fans <3,,
its fun,,
Very fun! This feels like the Sonic game they've been trying to make for 20 years now.,,
"Very fun, open-world yet fast-paced",,
"They didn't do the game justice when they revealed gameplay as it lacked the enemies. Finished the game, last fight felt pretty lacking specially compared to the rest of the Titans. Bosses are pretty good, final boss of each of the first maps are good, but the final is quite lacking. Didn't quite think they would end the game the said fight as it is. Played it on Hard mode. Just checked a review and apparently Hard mode adds an extra fight at the end... Would recommend the game overall.",,
"Before this game came out, a lot of people were speculating it was to be like BOTW but with Sonic factors seasoned in there. I am not even halfway in the game but I absolutely love it and wanted to write a review before I get lazy. I actually enjoy this game a lot more than BOTW for many reasons.

- Sonic is fast, meaning no matter how vast the maps are, you can literally zip from place to place with ease.

- Due to how lightweight and nimble Sonic is, he can literally scale gaps, big or small, on the highest cliffs in about two jumps and sometimes a little boost midair if needed.


- I can just about get to any hard to reach places, whether very narrow or very high due to how high Sonic can jump and once again, how light he is. It's incredibly fun trying to get up high areas with him, and highly satisfying when you do reach it.

- The game's graphics are incredible. The views on the maps I've explored so far are breathtaking. The water is soo beautiful and I love that the music grows muffled when you go underwater, a great attention to detail.

- Sonic can fall from the highest places and be perfectly fine. Don't get me wrong, I can understand Link from BOTW not being able to handle such a fall, he's only human, but seeing Sonic be completely fine after a ridiculously high fall makes me realize he's built quite different.

- The update that included collectible soundtracks from previous games that you can play anytime and as many times as you want is such a blessing, I love playing Sand Oasis from Sonic and the Secret Rings over and over as I speed throughout the map getting tasks done.

- Story wise I can't offer much as I'm not even really halfway through and I'm still trying to comprehend what they're aiming for, but all I can say is Sonic seems to be able to traverse Cyberspace without a scratch and so he's using that ability to free his friends who are trapped. Also he's the key.

- I wish they would've done something with Chaos and Chao Garden like SA and SA2, but we got Koko instead. Sorry if I spelled it wrong, they're not that memorable for me at least. Not a jab or anything but simply how I feel. Also trying to collect all Koko on all maps 100% is a bit of a chore. Especially since they can literally be hidden ANYWHERE on each map. I have them set up as the Springtime Koko which turns them into bright and colorful easter eggs because the default ones are tricky to spot sometimes even in plain sight. Don't think I'll be putting that back anytime soon lol.

- I haven't encountered any bugs so far since the updates it's had so that's good.

- The levels are neat too but not my favorite part of the game. The controls handle well unlike Sonic Forces and everything is clean. I really enjoyed the levels that included the soundtracks ""Flowing"" and ""Record and Control.""

- The boss fights so far are so cool and cinematic. It's fun unleashing all the combos I know onto those beasts.

All in all I really enjoy the game. Not really like BOTW to me but I can see why people compare the two. This game is very unique and a gift compared to what we got previously (Sonic Forces). I know my review isn't the most effective but I've not finished the game anyway and don't wish to spoil anything for anyone anyway so I am kinda keeping it brief. I can't wait to hop onto the new DLC as well. In my opinion this game was worth the money, the wait, and my time. I definitely recommend it to anyone who is passionate about the Sonic franchise and the games. This one surely won't disappoint! I think future Sonic games should have open world maps like this, it's really refreshing and enjoyable.",,
"Ageless masterpiece. I think in 10 years people will rediscover this game for it's full glory. It mixes so many wild elements from different genres into the most cohesive formula, or truly a work of art. There's something to be had here for most types of PC players. It has open world elements that feel like The Talos Principle on steroids, ultimate pinball experience, of course, mixed with over the top ray traced, beautiful original Sonic environments. New enemies straight out of the best JRPGS like the Nier series. Pokemon style object collecting, Zelda type mapping, & that's just the beginning 5 hours. In theory, all together it should be some mush. But instead they turned it into a classic for endless generations to enjoy. I'd say this game is close to three and a half A. True AAAA is almost here & Sega proves a strong contender.",,
LOVE IT!!!,,
This game has brought me the most joy of any game in a long long time. It's best played with a friend. The music is incredible.,,
"Sega, please, give everyone at Sonic Team a raise for this. Don't go letting other studios poach them like last time, they've struck gold and I don't want this to stop.",,
Sonic is back!,,
peak fiction!!1!,,
This game blew me away. I've been an avid Sonic fan for years. I usually don't like the 3D versions. Controls are always funky. Frontiers is slightly less funky. Game play can be relaxing. The soundtrack is amazing. I'm nominating this for Game of the Year.,,
"Easily one of the best games in the series. A very fun experience that flashes you back to the days of adventure with it's story. The gameplay is actually fun both in open zone and cyberspace, though it can take some getting used to even for those familiar with the series. The boy is home..",,
"The levels of this game are a hit or miss, some flow really smoothly while others feel absolutely terrible to play in. Homing attacks being delayed when you hit an enemy is absolutely the worst part of playing them, it is a feeling that you have to get used too, the speed they react when you hit balloons should be that the entire way through.

The best part about this game is the open world experience 100%. You would not think that an open world Sonic experience wouldn't work but the game flows much better playing through it. Every single mini boss and boss fight I've played through so far has been actually really great, which is not typical for a sonic game. At least for me, boss fighting isn't normally what I play a sonic game for, but they've managed to in this game make it extremely enjoyable to play. Some greps that I do have with the open world have been some of the puzzles are extremely subtle to the point where ♥♥♥♥ will blend in with the background. There is a puzzle for example on the first island where you're supposed to cut the red flowers that are near the sign. I guarantee you most people are going to miss that one, because it's a puzzle that isn't great in my opinion. Theirs also several where you are supposed to walk on the wheel that's in front of the puzzle, but how to get it to start working is not obvious. In my opinion, they should've made an indicator on the bottom of the wheel to indicate to the player that its where they need to go

Despite that, for the open world so far, I highly recommend this game. That alone is it's own experience.",,
"A good game from Sonic Team after over 10 years? Breath of the Hedgehog is a swell time, it really is open-world Sonic. And the story so far doesn't make me hate my life. Not to mention a great soundtrack. I give it a yes/10.",,
its pretty solid especially the open world but I feel like the game could have better instructions or help with what to do. so far this game has me confused and im somewhat not sure what the story is at this point because im not even sure what it is im supposed to be doing. I'm going to say that this game is recommend but wont lie a little far to understand.,,

fire,,
game is finished now top 3 sonic game play it,,
The game starts off really well but takes a nosedive in quality after you leave the first island and never recovers. I would only say to play this if you are a HUGE Sonic fan and want to experience all the games. Its definitely better than 06...there's that at least...,,
"Sonic Frontiers is an interesting new entry in the Sonic Franchise.

Now before anyone ask, its not completely open world but more open areas. Their are 5 islands to explore, these act as you hub world. In these hubs, you will want to complete various challenges to obtain items or to explore segments of the map. Once the whole map is explored, you will unlock some fast travel points. The items you collect are tokens, keys, gears, and stat items. Tokens will be used to advance the story and show more interaction between Sonic and other characters. Keys are used to unlock chaos emeralds. Gears open up cyber space levels (these are your traditional 3D/2D Sonic levels). Stats Items are used to upgrade Sonic stats (Attack, Defense, Speed, and Ring Capacity).

The game formula is: Go to an island, explore to collect gears to open up levels. Complete level with an S Rank to earn enough keys to unlock the Chaos Emerald. Once emeralds are found, fight the giant boss (called a Titan) as Super Sonic. Then go to the next island, the Chaos Emeralds scatter, rinse and repeat. While this sound repetitive, I must say I'm impress in the variety they threw in this game. There are numerous minigames in the hub world for unlocking items. Everything from grinding, fishing, platforming, fighting enemies, time trials, pinball, etc. Anytime I felt like I didn't want to do a particular minigame to get something, I could just run over to another and do something I prefer and hope the RNG gods grant me a drop in that item. Also I got to say, I did like the combat. I know a lot of people just say they button mash, but I feel if you actually do perform combos, you get some really decent fights. Also fight the bosses as super sonic, are just fun. I wish there was more super sonics fights in the game.

Now there are some wonky stuff in the game, such as Sonic momentum can be fickle during some tight platforming sections. The cyber space stages are reused assets from previous game (nothing new or original). Really the cyber stages was my lowest part of the game. I got tired of them real fast and honestly can't remember anything about them other than they reuse the level designs from past games.

Finally the story was really good. They reference previous Sonic titles (Lost world, resistance, etc) as well as some good side character progression for Amy, Tails, Knuckles, and Eggman. I was surprise, the story felt like I was reading the current IDW run. I really did like they trying to build a more coherent story rather than every game being episodic.

In all Sonic Frontier is a solid entry to the Sonic Franchise. While the full price tag is a little much for anyone who isn't a Sonic fan, grabbing this for a discounted price is a solid buy.",,
The boss fights alone make this game worth buying,,
"SONIC IS BACK BABY!!

it good,,
it gud,,

this game ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sucks,,
"Sonic Frontiers is an inconsistent incredible game. While there are many aspects of the game that could've been more fleshed out, the highs of this games make it the best Sonic experience since Adventure 2",,
Pretty good,,
"If your new to the sonic fandom and want to play a game then I suggest this masterpiece. The combat was spot on, story on another level and the puzzles never got too boring. The only real problem I had with the game was the pop-ins sonic's speed and the sometimes the game got a bit laggy, but if you look past these things then you'll be met with an amazing experience.",,
"Kinda meh. Story feels very disjointed. World feels empty even though there's a bunch to do. Lack of good background music makes it feel blah.

The classic Sonic sequences are ok but lack precision.",,
"Only have like 6 hours in the game so far, and it is still 6 times better than Breath of the Wild. Yeah; I went there.",,
"this is a good game, not just a good sonic game (real)",,
Rare Sonic W - 7/10,,
What is happening...,,
its cool,,
Make a good Sonic game challenge (IMPOSSIBLE!!): success,,
"A good 3D Sonic game for the first time in a long time. Or maybe ever? Nostalgia's hard to judge objectively. The character writing in particular is fantastic, but the combat and platforming is a lot of fun. An open world game where the open world is actually like, interesting to explore. Which is honestly a rarity in the genre.

Looking forward to seeing future Sonic games that have this much care, or even more, put into them.",,
"It's a Sonic game of high highs and low lows but in the end i can't recommend it. Especially after finishing it. Let's just say that was a SUPREME-ly disappointing boss fight + ending. Basically felt unfinished, kind of mirroring the overall game.

On the positive side, the overworld controls feel excellent. Fun Sonic platforming, varied and fun enemy fights, and cool combat moves. Cyberspace is basically challenge runs of iterations of levels in previous sonic games. Good mix of gameplay. Also, the instrumental soundtrack is absolutely beautiful. Really stays with you.

Now for everything else, and there is a lot of it. First of all, the lack of post launch support by this team is shameful. Really just a big middle finger to the customers, so they should not be rewarded with any full price purchasing of this game. The amount of object pop-in is absurd, especially for a game that features cartoony low-poly graphics. Then there are the balancing issues. All of the ""puzzles"" in this game can be done by a 5 year old and 98% of the platforming challenges are for some reason given timers that are four or five times longer than the time required to complete them. One might argue that this was done to give children the ability to enjoy the game. Except that the cyberspace levels can be tricky, and the other 2% of the challenges/boss fight sequences u have to nail perfectly or u start all over again. So the gameplay overall is pleasing but sandwiched in between many elements that are either boring or frustrating. The pinball minigame is just absurd. That's all I will say there. And the progression is completely broken. I acquired all the skills by the second island. And most of the seeds by the third island. What is the point in continuing to collect skill points, seeds and Koco when I'm maxed out already? This makes you OP for the boss fights and basically breaks what little challenge remained. Again, it did not need to be this way if the fishing rewards were more balanced, but this is just emblematic of the lack of attention to detail in this game. Speaking of the Koco, was it really necessary to make the level-up mechanic so slow and tedious? As a minor aside, the lag between being presented with an in-game menu option and actually being able to select it is just such bad UI design I cannot fathom how it got through QA. But it makes levelling with the Koco that much more frustrating. And in a complete contradiction to the wonderful instrumental soundtrack the boss fight music featured eardrum-piericingly bad emo rock. Just an awful choice there. And no widescreen support.

For PC gamers some these problems can be circumvented with mods. Widescreen support is there during gameplay, but broken during cutscenes. The Koco levelling mod mitigates the issue, but doesn't totally eliminate it. The pinball minigame can be skipped with a mod. But the horrible progression system and unbalanced challenges remain. And if you're stuck playing this mess on a console, I feel for you. The worst part is that this could ALL be easily addressed with a patch or two. Fix the pop-in. Adjust the timers. Rebalance the progression. Fix the UI lag. Fix the Koco levelling. Add widescreen support. Make the boss music optional. These are not unreasonable expectations in an industry that almost unanimously provides this kind of customer support. These days, every game gets released in a unpolished state and then is quickly patched up with QoL improvements as well as major and minor fixes. It has been almost three months since release and we've had one patch that fixed crashing, which shouldn't happen at all. It's a clear dereliction of duty by SEGA to have a simple platformer on the market in such an unfinished state, with such a lack of customer support. For this reason I do not recommend this game. If these complaints don't fully register with you, TL;DR It's a moderately enjoyable Sonic platformer but it's only a bargain bin game, you'll be disappointed if you pay full price.",,
"You just run around until you hit a spring that puts you on a rail. The story is ass, the cinematics are lifeless, characters are unexpressive. First titan was exciting tho.
At least with the latest patch i can play the game again so thanks for that",,
"Like other reviews have said, this is a weird game. Not in a 'lol so wacky' way, but in a ""how was a AAA-ish game made this way?"". The details of the story are a bit unclear, Eggman's behavior in the beginning isn't well motivated, some things 'just happen', there is occasional technical jank etc.

But there's a weird melancholy tone that underlies the entire game: The main characters you meet all seem dissatisfied with the state of their lives and want to change. . . Somehow though, it never goes too far for a game about a blue blur and it worked for me. But it really is a strange tone for a game like this imo, and I could see it turning some people off.

Regarding the open world, there are effectively hundreds of 'level fragments', like a small slice from a normal Sonic stage, and completing the fragment rewards you with a memory token you use to advance the plot. These are pretty varied and can be pretty tricky. Overall, I enjoyed them, though they did drag a bit near the end of the final island. There is occasional janky-ness but honestly it wasn't too often and generally was caused by entering a 'level fragment' from an unintended angle.

One of my favorite things about this game was the speed. You can level up Sonic's speed through collecting spirits, or you can max out your ring capacity. Once you're holding your capacity of rings, sonic becomes extremely fast. It's so fast that I think this is the only game that has given me motion sickness a couple of times.

The main bosses were honestly a little awkward for me, but they have good music and feel like you're fighting something huge. The mini-bosses sprinkled in the environment were more satisfying to me, maybe because they use traditional Sonic controls, unlike the major bosses.

Technically, the game was a little weird on Ubuntu 22.04 with a 5600XT, but after updating Mesa it seemed to work much better. There's no built-in ultrawide support, so I played with letterboxes. There aren't many graphic settings, though draw distance would have been really nice to have due to some pretty noticable pop-in.",,
sonic go burrrrrrrr,,
they put sonic in the game,,

this game is such a great game (plz remove denuvo),,
"Great game. As ""un-sonicy"" as it looks, it actually is a lot of fun. The whole sandbox, open world, idea for this game works very well.",,

"One of the best 3d sonic games, it might be the best actually, some things need to be fixed but overall it is good.",,
Best 3D Sonic since Generations.,,
"Arguably the best Sonic has ever played in 3D, with a pretty good story, great characterization of the cast, a very fun segmented open world to explore, great boss battles, some pretty nice post-launch content, albeit there are also some pretty mediocre linear levels you sorta have to play to progress (although not all of them), that last part is far from a deal breaker though, and I think this game lays an excellent foundation for the future of the franchise!",,
I'M HERE REACHING FAR ACROSS THESE NEW FRONTIERS,,
Sonic :),,
"Extremely recommended.
the storyline is interesting and amazing, the gameplay is fun and the new combos are also insane.",,
"An audacious new direction for the mainline Sonic games. I was quite worried but it ended up being a good surprise.
The vast islands feel like giant gyms, in a good sense.
Simple but satisfying combat and awesome new songs (I'm not a big fan of the Minecraft style piano tracks, though, but you can unlock music from past Sonic games to replace this).
The cyberspace levels are cool too.

Good job Sonic Team!",,
"This is a weird janky mess with clearly a lot of heart behind it. The story and tone, the enemy design, the characterization is pretty much all I want in future Sonic titles, they nail all of that. The gameplay and level design can get repetitive, frustrating, kinda dull sometimes, but Sonic Team is also a team with not much money and not that big of a crew and they're clearly pushing their limits with big spectacles like the bosses (which are all awesome). Despite everything, I still really enjoy running around these islands and exploring and collecting and doing little platforming chances. There's so, so much potential here and I know I should want more than just ""potential"" from Sonic at this point, but if they can just stick with this formula and improve from here I think the series could have a truly bright future ahead of it. I don't know if anyone who isn't a Sonic fan would get much enjoyment out of this, but… I am a fan. So, ya know.",,
"Amazing game, it manages to induce a great sense of freedom and exploration, while also still feeling very much like a Sonic game (in a good/fast way, not a bad/buggy way).

Probably the most I've enjoyed a 3D Sonic game since Generations, maybe even the original Sonic Adventure on the Dreamcast. I keep coming back to Frontiers as exploring the islands, doing mini-events, is actually quite relaxing, especially with the great background music.

Boss fights are absolutely epic and nail the sense of their scale and Sonic's power perfectly.

The game's not perfect - the cyberspace missions are somewhere around ""okay"" - but everything else is so great it more than makes up for the few weaker points.",,
"This is a great sonic game! There's so much freedom on the islands, it almost makes it feel like an old school Tony Hawk game (with all the grind rails and tricks and such). The boss fights are suitably epic (some of the best I can remember), and the story is pretty good for a game about an anthropomorphic cartoon hedgehog and his animal friends!

I'd still probably put this below the Sonic Adventure series as far as replayability goes, but it's a very good game.

I have three potential complaints:
1) It's a little slow to get started. You've got to give it maybe 2-3 hours to get into it, get used to the controls, and get a bearing on what you're supposed to be doing.
2) The cyberspace levels are not great. They're not very memorable and seem like a grind. I'd much rather the team had put their time into something else. Or maybe like 10 epic cyberspace levels as opposed to 28 meh ones.
3) I'm probably going to 100% this in about 30 hours of gameplay. Seems kinda short compared to the Sonic Adventure series? Wish there was some more to do.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is a good step in the correct direction for future 3D Sonic games. Only complains I have about the game is Sonic’s movement after jumping is non-existent, the pinball game in the 3rd world, and the cyberspace levels as a whole. Otherwise, absolutely loved my 26.8 hours of playtime on this game.",,
This game could be the beginning of something great. Not holding my breath on the next game being a masterpiece since Sega has a record of fumbling the ball when they've got something good going but for the first time in a while I've actually got a little hope for the future of 3D Sonic games.,,
"I was NOT pumped for this game at all. I've never been more proud to be proven wrong Sega. First 3D Sonic game I've loved since Sonic Adventure 2. It's not perfect, but it's a love letter to the fans and not just a step- but a full sprint in the right direction.",,
"I was skeptical about this Sonic game actually being good let alone decent, but after that first boss fight and getting a rush of badass vibes that I only felt back when the Adventure series came out, I can confidently say this truly is the best Sonic game we've had in a while. There are some pretty bad performance issues here and there, but the game runs really well for the most part and surprisingly smooth during parts where enemies go absolutely nuts.

If this is the start of 3D sonic games returning to their former glory then I'm glad I strapped back into this crazy ride. Also I'm seeing a lot of negative views on the game from people who copy and paste certain youtuber's opinions instead of actually forming their own and all I have to say to that is, I hope you enjoy taking the backseat while the real sonic fans have a blast. This is genuinely the most fun I've had with a sonic game in years and although Sega's mishandled some sonic game's prior- this however isn't one of them and won't be despite how desperate some people are trying to sell you on their own biases. I think it's safe to say they never wanted Sonic to succeed in the 3D game series again and.

I've fully completed the game and got every single achievement and at this point I still hold true to what I said prior to when I originally made this review. If I had to compare this game to anything, I'd simply call it the Shadow of Colossus of Sonic games mixed with the feel of the Sonic Adventure series and a bit of Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

Each major boss fight truly makes you feel like a badass in every way from the music to the combat, it's absolutely thrilling. My only complaint about them is that there's currently no way to re-experience them again once you're done. It'd be really nice to have a boss rush mode or means of respawning said major bosses because they were all fantastic in their own ways. One thing I haven't been able to say about a Sonic game in years is that earning my way to challenge each of the major bosses felt so rewarding that I was left feeling bitter sweet when it was over thus my want for a boss rush mode.

All in all, Sonic Frontiers is a must-play for those who enjoyed any or all of the 3D games on the gamecube. From the Sonic Adventures series to heroes, this is one you simply can't miss out as you'd be doing yourself a major injustice much like the people who're failing at dragging this game through the mud.

Just an fyi, I purchased the deluxe edition so if I really felt like I wasted my time and money- believe me this review would be one of the my most negative ones. I hate wasting money so I'm thankful this wasn't a waste at all even though the soundtrack was almost worth it on it's own.",,
"Sonic game of the decade man, hopefully the next game is even better 9/10",,
"The best 3D Sonic game I have ever played, I really like the open zone gameplay.",,
"sonic cool :)) (spoilers)

I finished the game earlier and, reflecting on the experience, i'd say the game is pretty good, even with the issues it has. I enjoyed the story as it provides some new lore on the origin of the chao and chaos emeralds which i found to be very interesting. Gameplay wise, i found the game to be very fast paced most of the time, though it did slow down on later islands while trying to locate ways to get to the objective markers. The combat was really fun after i got the hang of it. I found myself trying to take down enemies as stylishly as possible many times with the unlockable abilities from the skill tree. But the combat is definitely at it's best while fighting the minibosses and titans. Speaking of the titans, the themes during their bossfights are absolutely AMAZING, as is the ost in general. despite all this however, the game is definitely not 100% great. the pop in is absolutely dreadful and in desperate need of improvement and the camera and lock on systems are WAY too indecisive leading to you attacking something you dont intend to, or the camera trying to see 2 things at once. The final boss and ending seemed lackluster to me, and i was left sort of unsatisfied. I feel like ""the end"" was a huge missed opprotunity for an absolutely extreme, off the walls, space battle with a big scary nightmare creature, but instead its just some big rock and the fight is literally a glorified version of a minigame you have to play to OPEN DOORS, not even anything like a titan fight!",,

Sonic is back being cool, exploring open areas at top speed while solving mini rides, puzzles, tiny classic levels and battles against mobs and bosses. Also, you get to discover an engaging story while saving your friends and getting drops of insight from the villains to end turning super saiyan and fight giant titans with metal music in the background.

You can say it´s not perfect, but it´s a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun game.",,

"This is essentially just a clone of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild but with Sonic the Hedgehog. As someone who likes both of those things, I had a great time and will definitely be revisiting this game in the future like I still do with the Sonic Adventure games.

Speaking of, the ""Open Zone"" islands in this game remind me a lot of the Adventure Fields in Sonic Adventure but greatly expanded upon. They're a lot of fun to run around, explore, and generally goof off in. I was actually really surprised at just how technical some of the movement in this game gets. If you really know what you're doing, you can basically fly from one end of the map to the other.

I've seen some criticism thrown towards the Cyber Space stages, but I honestly found them to be a lot of fun. They're shorter, streamlined ""Boost""-style stages that take design elements from previous Sonic games. They stylistically clash with the rest of the game but are otherwise solid and enjoyable. They remind me a bit of the better stages from .

Oh yeah, and for all the real ones out there: You can go fishing with Big the Cat and it's way more enjoyable than it reasonably should be.",,
"Sega. Sega. Sega. Such a beautiful game! With some of the best gameplay Sonic has ever had in 3D.

However for those that do not know Denuovo forces you to have an internet connection just to launch Frontiers on steam. Without it you get locked out from playing a game you purchased. It also slows down the framerate which to some people who just want to be getting the full experience for a game they purchased, they cant.

Denuovo anti cheat is trash. Remove and then will consider picking up the game. Otherwise I riot until people can actually have a game they can play on the go especially for devices like the Steamdeck or Rog Ally without anti tampers ruining everything.",,

"I'm fiddling around with the final boss of the third island, but I think I reached the stage where I just can't be bothered to finish this game - and most likely won't be buying a future mainline Sonic title anymore either.

Art direction appears to be non-existent. The so-called open zones look drab and samey, have no personality and just aren't fun to explore as a result of it. The cyberzone appears to be made up of existing assets from previous games and frankly are the blandest set of stages in a Sonic game so far. Then there are choices in the gameplay design that are just baffling. Why would you even collect rings (or other items) anymore when you can endlessly farm them at any given point anyway? So why even engage with all those mini side tracks that are floating around in the air? Why do you have to collect XP all the way through the game for abilities that you will have unlocked before you even reached the second island? It all feels so pointless to do because there are just no stakes. What you get instead is an abundance of repetitive cutscenes, either related to achieving a goal or to a story bit (which are basically just two characters nailed to a position talking to each other). Also, yep, more than 20 years into its 3D era the series still hasn't resolved its long-running issues that are the camera or the game constantly misreading your controller input, and I'm just fed up with it at this point.

I there are some interesting ideas at the core, and the open world aspect probably a good direction for the series to take to, but I'm afraid expecting them to polish up the concept and improve on everything is just wishful thinking, because we all know that by the next game they will drop the approach entirely and do something else instead - and do it just as badly. Either way, I finally lost all hope and I'm just out at this point. Pity, but what can you do.",,
"Truly disappointing, across the whole board. It looks to have a lot of potential, but nothing in the game can really keep up with the player's movement, progression, or basic intellect.

The gameplay is the same as in almost every 3D Sonic game - press forward forever and occasionally mash buttons to attack enemies. It tries to make things more interesting with combos and special attacks, but their activation is always tied to other buttons which you would otherwise be using, leading to unwanted attacks where some other input was entered. There are a total of twelve (12) enemies in the entire game, which range from forgettable cannon fodder to irritating. Aside from the combat are various (about six) puzzles that would probably be very difficult for most inebriated players, such as ""walk in a straight line"" or ""press two buttons at the same time"".

The level designs themselves are terrible - every single island is a barren wasteland, with large stretches of absolutely nothing. Play areas are surrounded by cliff faces that send you to your death or a vast array of invisible walls that trap you in a never-ending, never-changing landscape of nothingness. But don't worry, every thirty seconds you'll inadvertently lock onto a spring, a rail, or maybe some area the game just decided is a path, and you'll be locked in to a designated sequence. Most of them can't be exited out of, as you watch Sonic careening across the stage in a series of poorly disguised quicktime events that leave you somewhere else, with some plentiful item now in your possession (unless you already did this particular section, in which case you get nothing).

However, lack of control isn't relegated only to closed sections; throughout the entire game, Sonic controls like a marionette made of tortillas being flung around by a toddler - every single button press sends him shooting in a random direction, most likely off the edge of the stage and into the waters below. This is pared wonderfully with one of the worst cameras in a AAA third person adventure game, which moves around faster than Sonic does and drags him along. This is especially prevalent in precision platforming moments, where you're trying to get (to coin a phrase) to just jump from one platform to another without losing all of your progress while fighting against the camera, Sonic's controls, and the very whims of the game engine. Sonic is constantly being flung wildly across the screen, usually faster than the player can comprehend and almost always faster than the game can.

The graphics are pretty bad in their own right, with objects bliping in and out of existence as you pass by. I have a pretty strong computer, but most of the game just looks awful and runs worse. Models are uninteresting and repetitive, and mostly blend together to create a muddy, boring mess of a map. Lighting glitches, dipping framerates, and texture problems are pretty much the norm. Wherever Sonic runs, a fresh patch of grasses is there, spreading just a couple of feet in front of him in whichever direction he is facing.

Speaking of glitches - there are a lot of them. From random segments bugging out to clipping through objects on the map. There were quite a few crashes that straight up booted me out of the game.

The in-game progression is also handled terribly. Being ""open-world"" (other than the aforementioned quicktime segments that populate every square inch of the map), you're free to collect and upgrade Sonic as fast as you like. And like the other aspects of this game, it can't seem to keep up with it. There are clear points where you can find yourself to be too strong or fast or whatever for the current level of the game - upgrade too fast, and it'll be hard to enjoy what remains of the game. Once you've collected enough of (patent pending), it'll still show up everywhere on the map. You'll still be prompted to collect more of it (and have to for completion, which unsurprisingly yields lackluster rewards). Completion is also handled poorly - for instance, completing environmental puzzles across the map unlocks rails that connect between them, allowing for quick movement across the map. Once you collect them all you get... the ability to teleport across the map. making those rails seemingly pointless for moving from one end of the map to the other.

To make matters worse, the game constantly assaults you with a barrage of hints and tutorials. They're fine at first, but, no, I don't need to be reminded how to face every single enemy I ever face. I don't need a tutorial for every single aspect of the game during New Game+. After I already finished the game and was coming around for a few final achievements (so that I could claim I finished the game and never think about it again), I was suddenly, without prompt, brought to a standstill, Sonic literally standing in place, while a Voice-Of-God started slowly explaining the functions of all the game's NPCs. NPCs that I couldn't interact with at that point, since I had maxed out every single one of them. It felt like a slap to the face (no, it wasn't accompanied by any visuals and was unskipable, thanks for asking).

Probably the worst part of the game is the story - Sonic was never suited for any serious story (look at his dumb face), and any storyline above ""save the world because you're fast"" immediately falls flat. I know that the characters are supposed to build off of previous interactions in other games, and the player is supposed to feel ""nostalgic"" for these growing characters, but I honestly couldn't care. I don't care about the cocos. I don't care about the digital dimension. I really don't care about Amy's quest to ""spread love everywhere"" (??) or Tail's impostor syndrome and how Sonic is the world's best bro wow he's so cool he knows everything even robots are impressed. The ""heart-felt moments"" shoehorned into the cutscenes were probably even worse, since no emotional connection was made in the first place, and really, ( ). The only mildly interesting plot element was Eggman's audio files, which had no overall bearing to the plot and are completely optional. The best character in the game is Big the Cat, and that should probably speak for itself.

The music was great, other than the meaningless instrumental fluff that accompanies everything that isn't a boss battle, and the stupid stupid song that plays during the credits and one of the cutscenes.

Overall, this game was a mess. Most of it wasn't memorable, and what memories are ingrained in my mind are those of irritation, boredom, or bafflement. I just didn't really have any fun playing it, and didn't feel like I gained anything from the experience. It took what little fondness I had for the characters and faith I had in the series and shot them in a random direction, riding down an inescapable rail before clipping through an untextured platform and careening down a cliff, forcing me to watch until they hit the water.",,

"The only reason I am giving a negative review, is because of an inmersion breaking issue that needs to be brought to light more to developers of this: We are in the year 2022 a couple of decades of open world games, computers with enought processing power to render ray-tracing in real time... and you launch this game with god-awful draw distance that would be put to shame even by a nintendo 64. there was a few couple of times when I was with my character looking at the sky, to find what cute amy collectible pointed by the waypoint but which was invisible to the naked eye and there was nothing until I got close enought to make it appear but wait a second... how the ♥♥♥♥ did that platform get there? here comes the tricky part which is not mentioned not even in the quick tips: you have to run like a headless chicken in circles in the hopes of taking a glimpse of the newly rail that popped in but wait: how the hell do i get to that rail? answer is...: to be continued... 90% of the other amy stuff is easy to get just be ready to lose your sanity if you go for 100% of them.. still I think achievement hunters are safe since I got 100% on an island without getting them all and I see no mention of them on the list.

So yeah sonic team, I can look past the spaztic camera, i can look past the fps limit on my 120hz tv, i can look past a couple of collectibles being unfigurable by common logiic that not even the most experienced q.a tester could find, I could look past denuvo and all that, just because I was an awful person in the 1800 era during a past life... and playing your dear game is how i seek expiation for those sins and hoping to delete enought negative karma so in my next life I am not born into a pug also I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ love sonic...

"Sonic Frontiers is great 3d Sonic Game. Frontiers is a major improvement over Forces and Lost World, Sonic Team managed to create a really interesting concept that works pretty well. There are some issues with the game though. A major one is the pop-in. Seeing all the springs and rails appear out of nowhere, especially in a platformer like Sonic where you have to be quick and precise, is frustrating. In addition, I encountered a lot of issues while playing through the cyberspace levels. There were some Cyberspace levels that were very fun to play through, like the famous 1-2 level in Kronos Island, but there were other levels that were painful to play due to how awful sonic controls were. As a result of how bad Sonic controlled in Cyberspace, getting collectibles like red rings was very challenging. There was a lot of jank and it was very annoying.

Now to the positives of the game, Sonic feels fun to control in the open world parts of the game. I love Sonic's fast speed, and I also like his new moves and fighting techniques, they basically turned him into a dragon ball character, which is really cool. Especially the Super Sonic Bosses, they were by far the hypest parts of the game. Overall, Sonic frontiers is one of the best 3D Sonic games since Generations. Hopefully, Sonic team can use this game as a foundation for future games.",,
"First island, things are going well. Second island, the pop in gets several times worse and the design becomes a lot rougher. Third island is even worse. It's not open-world because your movement controls boil down to a doublejump and run faster button, with all of the platforming being more like getting on an amusement park ride, going through pre-determined routes bouncing from springs or riding on literal rails. Combat is flashy but has zero depth. Every enemy has one gimmick and you have to use it every single time. 90% of the resources you gain are earned through the boring fishing minigame.

One of those games that just gets drastically worse the more you play it.",,
"This is probably a really hot take, but this game is dull as hell. Normally I dig Sonic games, but this one wasn't very exciting. Also, the digital deluxe edition feels like a cheat. I didn't realize it upon buying it, but you're basically paying to bypass progression. I've since submitted a refund request to Steam Support.",,
"I'm a very nitpicky kind of guy. I have to be honest, I can only find two issues with this game; The running and jumping. Which are pretty important details. Sonic normally has no momentum. He goes from a dime to full sprint (which at the start of the game is very slow) the moment you press on the analog stick. He does have a walking animation if you slightly kiss the stick for fine-point creeping Sonic into position, which you'll need to for his jumps. Like with all of the Rush, Boost, and Sonic 4 titles, Sonic's jump is based around when he's moving at boost speed. Trying to jump normally, which you're expected to for a lot of the platforming segments, and Sonic becomes a complete brick.

But after some button remapping to your personal liking, I have nothing but praise for this game. It's like it took the best ideas and mechanics from all of the previous Sonic titles (besides momentum and proper jumping) and combined them into one effective, impressive title. Even subtle things that were pretty good mechanics in otherwise sour titles, like Shadow's multi-spam attack from Sonic 06, or the tornado wind speed characters had in Sonic Heroes, once you get the flow of the attacks going it's one of Sonic's most fluid titles yet.

This is the best 3D Sonic title since Sonic Generations, and it's considerably a better title than it too, even if all of the tradition stages are recycled content. It makes sense, considering the game's plot.

A genuine 9/10. I just love it when a game combines all of my favourite gameplay mechanics into one package, like NieR Automata did.",,

"Spilling my Blue Guts, a Severely Disorganized Review

Going forward, please note the following:
- I have been a Sonic fan since I was 6.
- I suck at video games and my review is based on my personal experiences.
- I am on the 3rd island as of now, and am playing on normal.
- There's no TL;DR, I was gonna make one but it ended up being too long.

My first impressions of this game is that Sonic Frontiers is a celebration of everything that makes Sonic games enjoyable but on an open-world scale. Each one of the islands is big enough to be considered its own open world, and traversal via rails, bumpers, boost rings, boost pads and zip-lines is so fun that I often find myself forgoing fast travel even when I have all of the fast travel points unlocked. Zipping around the islands at max boost speed is probably the most fun video game experience I've had in an open world yet, and my speed is only Lv 20.

options are plenty available, and right off the bat, the game suggests alternate settings if you find yourself getting sick from You can control all sorts of things like Sonic's movement in camera FoV and sensitivity; this game wants you to feel nice and comfy-cozy while playing it and I love it. That being said, I feel like Action mode should be an accessibility option and not make you choose between settings you might regret choosing, and the puzzles, challenges, and enemies on normal mode seem a bit too easy so far. Maybe the difficulty will ramp up?

is fairly simple and a little button-mashy, but given the variety of special combo moves combined with excellent sound design and camera shots still makes it fun and somewhat challenging. Some basic enemies have a weakness that you need to figure out and if you perform it quickly enough, it'll one-shot the enemy or make it a lot easier to kill. This makes even basic combat more engaging by giving the player more choices on how they want to approach combat. Mini-bosses are fin and exciting, and even if I get stuck on one and a little frustrated, I know that I can go and do something else and come back to try it again. When I come back and finally do take it down, it is SO satisfying! Boss battles are epic in the most literal sense possible and make you feel like you hold unfathomable power in your hands!

in this game feels great, and I do like how it doesn't just let you hold boost continuously after landing on the ground and jumping, etc, making platforming and traversal more engaging. Sonic's sticky feet make for some funny moments when he stands on uneven surfaces and uses trees as high-speed ramps, but I often finding myself trying and failing to run up something that I feel like I should be able to, and I can't stop wondering why Sonic Team used such uneven and organic landscapes. This results in unexpected and unwanted hiccups in traversal and fighting enemies. I hope the next game has smoother terrain that delivers a more consistent experience. sometimes if you don't check the map, you might hurl yourself into a pit or off a cliff overlooking the edge of the map.

levels are super fun, and some paths and levels are extremely difficult to optimize, but it's a welcome amount of challenge that many Sonic fans were afraid was permanently removed from the Sonic formula. The difficulty of the cyberspace levels do vary quite a bit and on more than a couple occasions, I completed all of the requirements for a level on the first try, which was surprising. It would be nice to see more classic Sonic levels making an appearance as cyber stages, but you don't exactly have time to marvel at the stage design when you're making split-second routing decisions with precise high-speed platforming and jamming to EDM.

are fun but are usually pretty simple and easy to figure out and perform. I appreciate the wide variety; even between islands. Some of the challenges and story elements are completes by playing mini-games that range from herding Koco to playing a space shoot-em-up or pinball. There are some enemies and traversal challenges can grab the camera away from you though, and some islands have an emphasis on a certain gimmick that might be used in a mini-boss or boss fight. Still, when I complete a challenge, puzzle, miniboss, or mini-game, I feel satisfied. Besides, I'll be distracted by something else almost immediately.

is spectacular in quality and the soundtrack in particular Has a wide variety of tones, tempos and genres. It would have been great to hear more remixes of older songs, but a good variety of classic sfx do show up, releasing that sweet pleasure juice into my brain. The boss songs were less butt-rock and more screamo metal, and I am all for that when I'm taking on monstrous mechs a thousand times my size with MY BARE FREAKING HANDS. I often found myself going into cyberspace levels and having Sonic stand there while I just chill out to the music. The voice acting is all really good and although they are some pretty different voices for the most part, they aren't too dissimilar from what we are used to. The characters seem to have matured since the last adventure, and there are a lot of references to their previous escapades.

are fantastic and the game runs great! The pop-in is only occasionally distracting or annoying and doesn't usually impact gameplay. On the other hand, I really hope that they can make a new engine to prevent that issue from happening again, at least on higher-end versions. Enemy, boss, and character design are great with some nice details and complexities. Sonic and friends (and enemies) look super simple and cartoony compared to everything else in the game which is only slightly off-putting. The story is a pretty standard sci-fi ancient tech mystery with some shonen anime boss fights that truly make you feel like a badass. I keep finding myself drawn back to the game to uncover the plot bits and pieces at a time. Kocos are adorable and I'd love to see an even bigger variety!

I didn't mention fishing at all, but know that that is a wonderful part of the game, and each island gives you more variety of things to catch. Sonic Frontiers runs pretty well on Steam Deck with the right settings and is just as enjoyable. In case you can't tell, I highly recommend this game for Sonic fans especially, but also to anyone who enjoys high-speed platforming.",,
"WE WON, BOYS! HE'S FINALLY HOME!

Needless to say that it's been a depressing ride as a Sonic fan for about a decade now. TL;DR: Somehow we're in the best possible timeline where Frontiers isn't just a good Sonic game, but a good game in general! We're in the redemption arc, both as a setting and as a video game series. It's not perfect, but is any game perfect?

Fair warning: I will save spoiler discussion for the comments section. Don't open that if you haven't finished this yet, unless you don't care.

OPEN ZONE

The ""Open Zone"" gameplay really does manage to set itself apart from other ""open worlds"" and not just because you're playing as Sonic in it. Comparisons to Breath of the Wild are superficial at best - this is way more like Mario Odyssey or Metro Exodus. The only real ""Ubisoft checklist"" things here are the Side Stories, the Cyberspace levels and the map markers - everything else you have multiple methods of acquiring, and you don't need to get them all - only as many as the different grind walls ask you to get. In general 100% completion is very forgiving here - you don't even need to get all S ranks for an achievement or anything.

The best part is that this is arguably the best Sonic has ever controlled in an official game, and you can TWEAK HIM! This is almost the perfect mix of Adventure and Boost style controls - it just needs some polish for the jank. Sonic can turn so smoothly - the tank controls are almost entirely gone. The boost is heavily nerfed, no longer being a win button but more of a ""sprint"" button. The standout problem however is that whatever speed you've built up will be lost when you jump. Certain terrain features and ramps will carry your momentum when you boost off them, so this seems to be either a strange design decision or bug with his jump in particular. It's a little frustrating, but it's not gamebreaking! I also think base Sonic should be a little faster than he is. We have analog sticks for a reason, Sonic Team!

The islands themselves and the strange ""random junk placed everywhere"" nature actually kind of works here. You can sequence break and approach these little obstacle courses from many angles, and while they're often quite automated, I found myself entering a sort of flow state where everything just clicked and I was having a ton of fun with them. I will say that the second island, Ares Island is probably the best one - Chaos Island (the third) is basically ""the 2D island"" and almost all of its obstacle courses are janky 2D sections that can be sequence broken and turned into 3D sections due to the triggers for the perspective shift sometimes being limited to a single spring. It wasn't horrible, but it definitely was the weakest one.


The Cyberspace levels actually ended up being a pleasant surprise. While the level themes are far too limited and the controls are a bit too different from the main game for my liking, I was still able to squeeze a lot of fun with some of the (limited) movement tech you can pull off to get through them as quickly as possible, and they were still better than...pretty much all of Forces' levels. A lot of them surprisingly had alternate paths, and some sections were less automated than I expected. They definitely could've been a lot better, but they weren't offensive nor were they the bulk of the game. The music in these is also incredible - being everything the Forces music should have been. I don't know what happened in the time between Forces and now, but Ohtani went ultra instinct for this entire game's soundtrack. Wait till you get to the damn Titan fights especially!


Combat was also a pleasant surprise - it's definitely the best version of combat Sonic has ever had for sure, as it's generally fast, responsive and flashy. I will say that it's also unfortunately a bit easy, at least to someone with experience in more difficult action games or action RPGs like I have - even on Hard the ring mechanic is overly forgiving especially when you can generate more at any time with the Cyloop (this seriously should have been a cooldown or something) and parrying is way too strong given you don't have to time it. I think there was one point where you had to time your parry given some of the puzzles relying on it get really fast and give you a generous timer to compensate, which would've been more difficult had you been required to time them. Some of your attacks take a bit too long to come out and cancelling them or speeding them up doesn't really...happen.

It also gets a little confusing having to remember which combination of buttons does what attack, especially when a lot of them don't actually do much different other than ""deal lots of damage."" I think Sonic Team should actually look at Kingdom Hearts to iterate on this system - in those games, all your melee attacks are handled by just one button (or occasionally a different one for a special move) but combo modifiers give you different, context sensitive moves that are determined by distance, elevation, whether enemies are surrounding you, etc. giving it a lot of hidden depth. The combat in those games also tends to have a lot of physicality and momentum to it, which is something Frontiers kind of has but would've done better having more of.


Now, if you're a lore and story nerd like I am that grew up on golden age Archie Sonic, the story and tone in this game is a dream come true! Ian Flynn has had nearly two decades of experience with this setting and these characters and oh my god does it show in this game's script! Characters are finally acting like characters and not caricatures, flanderization is completely gone, the writing finally knows when to take itself seriously and when to joke...it's like seeing the fantastic writing from the series's long comics history finally making it to the mainline games. Even better, this is expanding on plot threads and ideas that haven't been touched on since the ADVENTURE ERA! There are only two points where it disappointed in this aspect, which I'll get to in the comments, spoiler warning.


Finally, the fishing is there and it's cute and relaxing and simple - but I heavily recommend holding off on it until postgame after building up your purple coin stock, because its economy is absolutely busted. About 15-20 minutes of fishing is enough to max out your stats in the postgame if you had been upgrading them diligently throughout the game. I was about around Lv.30-35ish in ATK, DEF and SPD when I beat the final boss, and soared up to Lv.99 after doing this. I recommend playing on Hard, not heavily grinding your ATK and DEF and ignoring your Ring stat for the most consistent challenge. I also will say - switch the game to Normal once you're near the end of the final island, because Hard adds an extension to the final boss that is awful in practice and doesn't change the ending or give an achievement. The whole game took about 20ish hours to finish, making it easily the longest and most content packed Sonic game to date ignoring stuff like the hot-dog induced nightmare that is Unleashed.


So, in conclusion. Sonic Frontiers is it, chief! This is one of the best 3D Sonic games we've ever gotten, and might be the best written Sonic game story PERIOD as well. I originally played this through family sharing, but I was enjoying it so much that I just outright bought it so I wouldn't have to wait for my friend to quit his own library to keep playing. It has it's valleys, but this is absolutely a giant leap in the right direction and Sonic Team/SEGA need to just ITERATE on this rather than throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Key improvements right now need to be the team size (~60 people? I know ""too many cooks"" but that's sad for a triple A IP,) the jump physics, the combat and the Cyberspace side content, whatever form that takes in the next entry.",,

Being a Sonic fan since I can remember, after losing touch with the franchise after the disaster that Sonic Forces, and the later disappointment that the Sonic Colors ""Remaster"" were, I was willing to give Sonic Frontiers a chance as it released on Steam today, and after seeing the raving reviews all over, I rushed to the wallet and bought it.

After opening the menu imagine my disappointment when I was greeted by your standard mediocre console port with low quality textures, no ultrawide support, 60 fps cap, which might seem like a petty thing to complain about, but at the AAA price of 60€ for the standard edition, and 70€ for the Deluxe edition is definitely worth pointing out and a troubling first impression.

The game opens with a low resolution, in-engine cutscene with lighting and shading issues, and a really weird antialiasing effect during rain which makes the game look like something straight out of 2008, or some fanmade SFM low quality animation over on Youtube.

So I'm here in the first stage, running with no previous control tutorials or popup messages to get the hang of the game.
Off to the Settings to increase the camera sensitivity and still feeling the max setting not being enough for how slow Sonic handles.
You would think the game would play like previous Boost games à la Unleashed, Generations or Colors, but unlike in those games, Sonic feels slow even on the ""high-speed"" setting compared to previous games, and even other fanmade Sonic games. I know there is a speed stat which will probably be later upgradable to make this more bearable, but the base max speed feels terrible from the get-go and makes me wonder why there is a max speed setting available.

Sonic can fight in this game, with fists and kicks mostly, and a decent collection of combos and skills to make the combat feel deeper through a skill tree system. It is an expansion on the combat from previous 3d Sonic titles, which would stick to homing attacks and spin dashes in order to deal with enemies.

The story feels interesting and a continuation of the pre-release trailers but is immediately obliterated by the open-world gameplay with a disconnected, seemingly random amalgamation of springs, rails and platforms floating in the air with no attempts at suspension of disbelief, which would make you think there is some weird rendering issue with the game not loading the level to hold these elements, but is actually the intended effect.

Unlike the previous games, which would consist of various straight levels with additional shortcuts where you had to go as fast as you could to beat the clock, Sonic Frontiers is an open world game, and open means OPEN.
You are barely given the base moveset when the game decides to drop you in the middle of the map, with a vague indication to complete mini-games scattered all over, in order to get the keys required to unlock the straight high-speed sections.
These sections are really short, and they really feel more like mini-games than in earlier titles, which is kind of a disappointment, as day levels were the highlight for me in Sonic Unleashed or Generations.

The bosses are the main spotlight in this game for me, with the combat playing well with the movement mechanics, and ingenious weakspots and phases.

The music has always been great in Sonic games, and it's no exception in this one, where it ranges from soothing lo-fi themes to straight up bangers, killed by either the terrible boost echo filter, or the obnoxious sounds that range from earrape springs to loud rails to the pick-up sound of purple coins, pink hearts, red beans, blue beans, kocos, blue exper- WHY ARE THERE SO MANY CURRENCIES.

All of this combined makes the game feel more like a tech demo than a full-fledged, AAA release which baffles me when I see the other reviews screaming praise and making the game look like a return to shape for Sonic, when it comes across as exactly the opposite to me.

Far from sounding like a contrarian, this is NOT the Sonic I fell in love with.
The franchise has been heavily experimental for years, with Sonic Team always trying new concepts and gameplay designs.
I have played every Sonic game, and in every one of them (yes, even '06, incredible I know) I have found something endearing or created with the intention to have FUN, to try to make a game out of anything you can think of: DS platformers, racing hoverboards, RPGs, exploration...
But Frontiers feels like a desperate attempt at adapting to the new and trying to bring Sonic to an open world, and failing at it because floating rails and 10 different currencies to collect are not what Sonic has been about, and it feels wrong.

Probably buy during sales, or full price if you want to support the developers, but I don't feel like this is a Sonic game worth 60€.",,
"update: with updates i'd say if the game is on sale then go get it or just find a way to get it for cheap. i still wouldn't pay $60 for it but the updates make the game go from mediocre to barely good at the very least for me. i'm still giving this a thumbs down because of the fact that the new stuff should have been in the game from the get go and even then that stuff is still flawed because of some poor design choices both in the base game and the new updates.

starts off good then falls off hard during the end. mods make this game 10x better so finish the game vanilla if you really want to, then just get some movement and combat overhaul mods and change sonic to shadow for good measure and bam you get a better game

doesnt stop chaos island and onwards from being absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the final bosses from being the lamest things on the planet and the climax on rhea island from being more cliche than sonic heroes and denuvo still being in the game but it makes the gameplay better for the most part and shadow is cooler than sonic so a win is a win",,
"I preordered this game, and the only thing I regret is not getting the deluxe edition. I grew up with sonic, though I never really got to play Sonic games. Now that I'm older I played some of the games that I could, and playing this game felt amazing. I love this game's combat, how it feels like Devil May Cry with the combo expression. The open zone feels amazing to run through, and even blitz through with Power boost. The Super Sonic fights are peak Sonic, the music in the fights made me more hyped about the fights than anything else. The game felt so refreshing to play, though this starts to slow down in the last two Islands. The last two Islands felt rushed, and the hype and excitement I had for these two Islands didn't get lived up to entirely. Now with Update 1, this game is reinvigorated, The Boss rush is so fun with the difficulty it provides, the Jukebox makes running around the open zone even nicer, and the Cyberspace rush gives back the feel of the game being a boost style game.",,

"I have never really understood how a Super mega company like Sega still manages to dish out games that feel amateur. Sloppy cutscenes, questionable voice acting, their games often have an indie vibe to them.

And this game is fun. Very, very fun. Crazy action, a real sense of speed, paired with an amazing soundtrack and interesting world design, it is just a lethal combination.

9/10. Wish it wasn't as buggy or it would get even more. I just found it so much fun to play, I didn't care about it's imperfections.",,
"10/10
I was going into this after avoiding any spoilers or reviews and was expecting a broken, buggy game with a terrible story, ok music and a terrible camera. All these we have come to expect from Sega.

HOWEVER:
After playing through the camaign, I have become hopeful for the future of Sonic. If this is what Sonic games will be like in the future, COUNT ME IN.
THIS GAME IS FUN FUN FUN. The Story is better than most and has a great progression as you play. THE CAMERA IS ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD. IT WORKS, I MEAN REALLY. THIS IS GREAT. As for mechanics, the attacks are fun and are satisfying to perform. The Upgrade systems works well with the style of game although I wish there were more. The Enemies are varied enough and are like mini puzzles to solve in order to beat them. The Mini Mech Bosses can be just difficult enough to be fun and satifying to beat. AND FOR THE BIG BOSSES, think SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS accompanied by the most epic soundtrack in any sonic game (including the classic/I KNOW CONTROVERSIAL BUT MY OPINION). Accompanying the bosses, also you get to do some absurdly epic moves to obliterate the bosses.
THERE ARE 5 MAPS and are varied enough and have really cool tricks and platforming puzzles.

THE RUNNING STAGES ARE RIGHT BACK TO CLASSIC STAGES. They create an amazing sense of speed are incredibly FUN.



THE PROBLEMS:

POP IN IS BAD and will probably fixed/patched in the future. I found that I was able to ignore most until something popped in 5 ftt away in front of me(only happened 1x).

THE RUNNING STAGES
I found they seemed to stick mainly to the green hill zone theme and not a variety of themes. Also, some of the acheivments can be too easy like the red coins (which it would be nice to have scattered around the stage) while others like the time challenge can be a little too tight.",,

The main reason to buy this game is if you really want anything with the Sonic IP slapped on it. The execution of even basic 3D platformer concepts is lacking, making the entire open world just a glorified level-select screen till you can get to the real meat of the game inside the cyberspace levels.

Not worth the launch price in my opinion, I'd buy it again once it goes on a reasonable sale.",,

"PEAK FICTION

Edit for real review (THIS WILL HAVE SPOILERS):

Sonic Frontiers is a great game, it's now even my favorite Sonic game beating out Sonic Generations. With that said, the game does fall short in some areas and may or may not affect your enjoyment.

Let's start with the pros:
-Open World controls are GREAT, rarely did I feel like I couldn't do something or get somewhere because I was fighting with the controls.

-Combat, while not as flashy as Devil May Cry, or as complicated as some other Hack-n-Slash games, does feel good to use and game DOES give you decent progression with getting new attacks.

-Enemies are generally extremely fair to fight. I can't think of a single enemy type that felt like it had too much health or super obnoxious mechanics. Some enemies can be annoying but that mostly came down to me being dumb rather than the game itself.

-Cyloop is a great and interesting addition to the gameplay with the different applications it has. From providing a knockup on some enemies to being used in puzzles to even letting you get infinite boost for a period of time. I sincerely hope this gets used in future games (assuming they do an open world/semi open world format again)

-The vast majority of the boss fights are my favorites in the series, the combination of how the fights play out visually combined with the music of the fights made me giddy the entirety of the fights.

-The story is pretty good, not 10/10 masterpiece writing but actually has the characters show CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT and not be dumb downed stereotypes that they have been for the past 10 years. Thank you Ian Flynn.

-Visually, I think the game looks great. There is a caveat to this which will be in the cons but the game looks great.

-MOST minigames (and I do mean MOST) are fine breaks from the general gameplay and don't overstay their welcome. There is also a caveat to this that will be in cons.

Before the cons, I'm gonna do some indifferences I had with some things in the game.

-Cyberspace levels are in general hit or miss in my opinion. Both in terms of gameplay or music. Some levels are very fun, and some of the songs are great as well but some levels are outright not fun to play for 1 reason or another and some of the songs aren't bad but feel more like background noise than anything else. The themes of the levels are also largely strange as there's really only 4 level themes (Those being Green Hill, Chemical Plant, Sky Sanctuary, and a more city and military theme similar to City Escape or Speed Highway but unique in its own right) and don't really do much for the game itself.

-The game isn't hard even on the hardest difficulty, this doesn't really mean much at all in the grand scheme of things but do keep it in mind

-Some later enemies in the game are largely just reskins of previous enemies, but most if not all have more attacks so they don't just feel like ""the same enemy but he's red now and thus has more health""

Now for the cons:

-The first one you come across will be the Cyberspace controls. I praised the open world controls and feel bu Cyberspace feels off. I got used to it as time went on but Sonic just didn't feel exactly right. I get why it works different since open world gives you too much freedom in movement for confined levels and would work against you as well but it feels TOO stiff.

-The pop in. While this does not bother me largely at all, this WILL be a point of fault for many people. Many set pieces will just appear in the open world with no fade in whatsoever. As far as I could tell this only happened with the Sonicy level pieces and not enemies or the grass.

-The last island. Now don't get me wrong, the gameplay and everything is the same so it's not inherently the island itself but a combination of things. This will be HEAVY SPOILERS:

The final island wants you to do the same beats as the first 3, but the issue comes in with collecting the Sage hearts. For whatever reason you either need to collect EVERY heart on the island or at the very least the VAST majority to actually finish all the dialogue to progress to the final boss. This is where Big's fishing minigame came in, and why I haven't talked about it until now as it's both a pro and con. With the finishing, it allows you to purchase things like keys, gears, and that island's NPC token (hearts, medals, or wrenches) along with Lost Kocos and Attack/Defense seeds. You could very likely skip most of the open world grind by doing JUST the fishing, which is what I did for the final island with the hearts.

-The TRUE final boss. Hope you like the hacking bullet hell minigame. This is skippable by playing on Normal but is easily the worst final boss solely because it's not Sonic at all and this gameplay style only comes up in the later half of the game, and only about 3 times.


With all that said, I still firmly believe this is a solid 8.5/10, 9/10 if you don't count the optional true final boss.",,

The world is huge and full of things to explore, which adds to the storyline and background of Starfalls Island and the Sonic-lore in general.

Far as the game, yeah it's not perfect. Biggest issue as many have noted is that things tend to pop in, but it never really detracted from the game for me. Otherwise very few issues, most of which were minor and had resolved themselves in seconds. Overall I just spent some four days straight playing this friggin game and I enjoyed every second of it. If you like Sonic games, it's worth checking out.",,
"To be honest, I like most other longtime Sonic fans didn't have much faith in Sonic Frontiers. After the burn of mediocrity that was Sonic Forces, Sonic Team was no longer putting out the quality titles some of us grew up on. Even the lead up to this game didn't give out a positive input within the community, but through all the trials and tribulations, Iizuka stuck by this game and told us to give it a shot regardless of press...well, for once he was right.

Sonic Frontiers' open zone mentality is super fun, while the game is just a huge playground with things to do here or there, I haven't had this much fun with a Sonic Team game since Generations. They really wanted to create a future blueprint for the series so that they can continue making more Sonic games like this.

Sonic Frontiers really does try with its Story, since this time around long time Sonic the Hedgehog comic writer Ian Flynn headed the story for this one with a few others, that made me want to continue playing to see what happens next. While the story is not that strong, the characterization of Sonic and friends in this game is great and made me feel emotions I have never felt in a sonic game before. As for the gameplay loop, while I enjoyed myself throughout the game even beating it twice from start to finish, it still needs some improvement. Gathering memories for your friends is not a bad mechanic but after a while of going thorough obstacle courses again and again you want to get a move on, which is why I'm glad that Big the Cat's fishing mini game mitigates that tedious grind. The cyber space levels are okay, with them definitely being the weakest part of the experience, I don't think I'm tired of the boost formula but it feels like they are and honestly I would be okay if we never see them ever again. Soundtrack wise is mixed for me, while the open zone music is alright, the boss music and the cyberspace music can slap that's for sure. Boss battles are pretty fun even sometimes they can be a bit wonky sometimes, still overall really fun.

And honestly that's the best way I can describe my experience with Sonic Frontiers, really fun but overall can grow and improve with future entries. We didn't know what to think before this game came out, but I'm glad I had fun with this one rather it just being another dud in the Sonic plethora of Mediocre to bad games pile. Hear this now though Iizuka and Sonic Team, right now you have our trust and undivided attention again, don't go squandering that trust again.

Please.",,
"Amazing game overall. Story written well, they fixed Tails' personality and turned him back from a coward, really showed how kind Amy is instead of making her a fangirl of Sonic. Knuckles was also written well as he wasn't made stupid in this game, and showed his rivalry with Sonic very well. The new character Sage is serious and interesting in how she thinks of Eggman.

Another thing great about the game is the beautiful visuals, the landscape looks amazing, and the effects for things like boosting are incredible. The bosses are actually decently challenging, and there's TONS of things to do around the islands. There's one large issue that's clearly visible while playing the game though: the pop-ins are EVERYWHERE, and you can see things just pop into existence on screen all the time, though this couldn't hope to outweigh the amazing sights of the Starfall Islands.

Another great thing about this game is the gameplay, the combos are satisfying to pull off, and very rewarding to use. they may be difficult to learn and remember at first, but over time they become muscle memory with enough practice. the combos and techniques are similar to games like Metal Gear Rising or Devil May Cry.

The Cyberspace levels feel great and when you're able to fly through them it really gives the feeling that you're going really, really, REALLY fast, as Sonic games should be. while the levels are oftentimes based off of levels in the older games, it's nice seeing them remade in this new game, and they still feel as amazing as the original (especially the Radical Highway level).

The music in this game is just as good as you'd expect music to be in a Sonic game and more. The music is calming whilst running through the Starfall Islands, and when it comes time to fight the titans, the guitars kick in and the boss tracks are amazing and really help make the fight feel a lot more intense. Find Your Flame, I'm here, and Breaking through it all do a really great job at conveying the feel of the battle, and the syncing of the fight with the music reminds me of playing MGRR, when things like Metal Gear RAY's blade comes down and the lyrics yell ""RULES OF NATURE!"". If I had to pick what I liked the most about this game, I'd certainly say the music 100% of the time.

All these things together can make me confidently say that this is probably one of the best Sonic games ever made, standing above great games like Sonic 2, Sonic Unleashed, and Sonic Adventure.",,
I do not understand the reviews for this game. I am usually biased for every Sonic game and I feel this one is much worse than Forces. Everything seems pointless and boring. The open zone also feels empty and all the pop-ins make it worse. Story is not helping as it is almost non-existant.,,
"Absolutely horrfying for a 2022 game.
As November 2022, the game feels like a 2010 game:

-The game overall graphic feels like someone made a fanmade game that worked during his freetime.
-Animations completely unpolished
-There's 0 momentum of the character
-Graphics although set to max settings the view distance is extremely short
-Cutscene are stuck to 30FPS, and gameplay max to 60FPS
-menu and UI is totaly choppy and feels really slow.
-Perfomance is totaly awful.
-Sonic, in the past games, has a lot of character when talking or when having a interaction, but in this game only give face expressions that are priceless...
-The only good thing about this game is the new combat mechanic and it's soundtrack.

"Product received for free

the pros greatly outweigh the cons here. if you're on the fence, get it.

gonna start with the cons. the strict camera and pop are the core issues for me. the game will decide for you when you can't free cam and it can get a bit frustrating. you may not always get to plan your route when running because some rails etc dont appear until you're right next to them. some enemies are more fun to fight than others. the story is hit or miss. and the collecting aspect gets a bit tired by the 3rd island.

BUT. i still recommend because there is a lot to like. controlling sonic if F U N. i cannot overstate that. the game either fails or succeeds on how it feels to play as sonic and i really have to say i enjoyed him. i laughed off the odd obstacle and rail placement but in practice they work to give you satisfying momentum while traversing the map. i like the cyberspace levels myself but i can see why others don't. the OST is Great and i spent way too long fishing. the boss fights are also fun (esp the 2nd island)

im happy i can still have fun playing a sonic game.",,

"Sonic Frontiers follows Sega's traditional of pushing out woefully unfinished games in time for the holiday season. Make no mistake, this is a hot mess. It's also the best hot mess Sonic Team have made since 1999.

Turning Sonic in to a spectacle fighter lands shockingly well. Enemy encounters are kinetic and well designed. They've been a highlight thus far, which was a pleasant surprise. Unfortunately the platforming doesn't fare as well. There's serious issues with getting Sonic where you're trying to aim for, and trying to target loops in mid-air is needlessly imprecise and frustrating. The controls being designed for large environments makes them feel bad in the linear stages, and I'm not sure why the Sonic Generations component is even here. Frontiers could have easily gotten away with only being an open world game, and I think would have been better for it.

While the quality of the prerendered cutscenes is shamefully poor, in-engine gameplay looks phenomenal. Sonic feels right at home in the realistic environments in a way that Mario couldn't manage. It feels like this is what the team wanted Sonic Adventure to look like, and technology has finally caught up. Despite frustrating pop in issues and lack of extensive visual options, the presentation is very polished - and I've already said 'woah' out loud more than once.

There's some serious fanservice, and it feels like the game was designed with great care. Turning Sonic into an open world RPG is a big trick to pull off and I think they did a great job. The problems with Frontiers really come down to not being ready to ship. In principle, it's an incredibly cool new direction for the series - and I really hope we'll see a sequel that can expand on these ideas with less jank.

How much enjoyment you get out of Sonic Frontiers will largely depend on how big of a Sonic fan you are. If you're willing to meet the game half way, there's a lot to like here. It's not the best brawler, platformer, or open world game - but the way those elements combine is delightful. For the first time in years, Sonic feels imaginative and forward-thinking rather than a relic trying to catch up with modern times. It's not a perfect Sonic Adventure 3, but it's a better one than I was expecting - and I'm really looking forward to playing more.",,

A Step To The Right Direction For Future Sonic Titles.,,
"--- SPOILER-FREE REVIEW ---

Sonic Frontiers is without a doubt one of the best games in the franchise, in recent memory. The series has had its ups and (really low) downs but Frontiers proves that there is still hope for the blue hedgehog in the 3D platformer genre.

The main story is made up of five open areas to explore. Each island has a dozen of short but sweet boost-era stages, platforming sections with rewards for completing them, puzzles, collectibles and enemy encounters. One of the updates added a ton of new missions and stuff to do so it prolonged the game time quite a bit, without making it too tedious.

While the focus of the gameplay is on platforming, Sonic Frontiers also features a decent combat moveset to fight the enemies throughout the game. Most of these moves are executed by combining two buttons, making it quite accessible for everyone. The platforming is tight and fun, and incredibly customizable through the options menu. It is possible to tinker around the acceleration and decceleration values, for example, as well as the turning speed and much more. In one of the updates, the spindash ability was added and, while many say that it broke the game, I think it made the game even more enjoyable.

Even though I enjoyed the game quite a lot, I still think there are some big flaws in it. My biggest complaints are the boring environments, the unnaturally cheesy cutscenes and the lack of polish in some instances of the gameplay.

While the story is decent, the cutscenes are terrible in my opinion. From weird gesticulation to awkward pauses in the dialogues, these might be some of the worst cutscenes in the franchise (yes, even worse than SA1's!). About the environments, I suppose they opted for something more generic just to play safe, but coming from a series that is known for its vibrant and creative level environments, these stages are rather disappointing visually. The lack of polish is most apparent during the boss fights, where the camera moves awkwardly and there is a lack of weight in the animations of the enemies and a lackluster atmosphere during the fights.

Having just finished The Last Horizon update, I can say the Sonic Team made a really good job in maintaining the game for close to a year. This update is quite massive, featuring three new playable characters with unique movesets and challenges, new cyberspace levels and a reworked finale. I will point out that the difficulty spike in this campaign tremendous, and even on Easy mode some parts are downright unfair and frustrating. Despite that, the new ending is a huge improvement over the original one and I'm glad the developers listened to the community.

Overall, I can't recommend enough this game for 3D platformer lovers. Sonic Frontiers has good gameplay, a fine story, an amazing soundtrack and quite a bit of content to keep you entertained for hours.",,
This game is borderline unplayable.,,

But if you can, turn all the speed related settings in the gameplay menu to max, hold that boost button down, and (almost) never let go. Now you have become the speed. It's extremely fun to master.

Takes about 20 hours to get everything worth collecting, so I would recommend getting it on sale. Big shout out to Sonic Team for adding that one complex tombstone puzzle in a video game marketed towards children tho lol.",,
"Honestly, was really hesitant in getting this game as imo, as the quality of sonic games had declined heavily since Sonic Heroes (2003). However, this game came as an amazing surprise. We FINALLY have a good sonic game. A few of the key points where this game shines are as follows.

The cutscenes and open world environment are beautifully crafted.
There is genuine character development.
The combat feels organic and well designed.
Collecting items across the area for story progression felt mostly organic (which I find is hard to pull off).
Enemies felt well designed aesthetically and mechanically (mini-bosses are actually fun).
Ability tree

However, it would be unfair of me not to point out some of the flaws I came across whilst playing this game.







I do think this is an amazing sonic game. The best one since 2003. However, there is no such thing as a flawless game. This is definitely a good base, however a few things should be polished up with any following game. Without a doubt though. I would recommend this game.",,
"Before I start, I need to make this clear – Sonic Frontiers is not a bad game. If reception had been harsher, I might even have spun this review more positively. However, we’re somehow in the ludicrous position that Sonic Frontiers is considered an “Overwhelmingly Positive” game. This is absurd. Whatever scrappy fun that can be had with the game, there’s no denying it’s an incredibly inconsistent, buggy and often ugly experience that without the Sonic name attached would be lying forgotten in a ditch somewhere.

And it’s the inconsistency of experience that makes it difficult to review. As backhanded a compliment as it is, Sonic Frontiers is absolutely the best 3D Sonic game since Generations. I’d even argue that in retrospect it’s more enjoyable than Colours. The core idea of the game, when you think about it makes a lot of sense. Sonic’s whole deal is going fast so wide open spaces with lots of mini challenges to take on at your discretion sounds like it had a lot of potential.

And that’s what Sonic Frontiers is: Potential. As an execution of that gold plated idea it’s sloppy and uneven, and this starts right out of the gate with the frankly dreadful graphics. It looks just awful. A moody, desaturated look works for a game that holds atmosphere as a high priority. Breath of the Wild (let’s just rip off that plaster) went for the art direction it did to evoke a very particular mood. While Sonic Frontiers might be a more grounded, serious experience than Sonic Forces it’s still a game about primary coloured woodlife fighting a big fat mad scientist. It ends up looking like one of those “Sega hire this man” demos cobbled together from unity assets. Sonic already has a really strong visual identity, and it baffles me that the developers didn’t attempt to recreate this (well it doesn’t really – it was clearly a cost saving measure).

And that’s before we even get to the technical issues. The plus side – it basically runs absolutely perfectly, with no stutters, frame wobbles and as far as I can tell pretty much perfect frame pacing. It feels extremely smooth and responsive. The negative – it’s jank AF. The pop in is absolutely as bad as all the meme videos make it out to be, and it actually makes it very difficult to plan routes. Modern Sonic games having whacky physics is nothing new, and considering the scope I’m willing to give it some leeway, but the game still feels like it’s about to fly off the rails (sometimes literally) at any moment.

The actual structure of the game is interesting. Rather than going fully open world or fully level based, Sonic Frontiers tries to split the difference - and it mostly works. There isn’t a full fat open world – instead there are five “distinct” areas (more on that later). These “open zone” sections are full of mini challenges scattered across the landscape where you can pick up medals, which are used to advance the story, or gears, which are used to access more traditional boost style Sonic levels. Honestly, this seem like a great way to add some variety while keeping the traditional style of gameplay intact. It’s shame then that these cyberspace levels are mostly kind of rubbish – they all make use of reused assets from Sonic generations, and they’re mostly very short and lacking in alternate routes. The physics seem all kind of wonky in them too, and I felt no compunction to ever return once I’d got what I wanted from them – keys to open up chaos emeralds. Once you have enough emeralds and emblems, you can fight the boss of that particular area.

The rest of your time will be spent opening up the map through a series of mini challenges (I guess this game’s equivalent of the Ubisoft tower). It all comes together quite nicely, and the core loop does prove to be quite entertaining. Or at least it does until you get to Area 3. Area 3, for some reason locks you into awful 2D side scrolling sections constantly, and once you’re in there’s no way to get out except to complete the whole mini challenge. This is particularly infuriating when you’re just trying to get somewhere and the game yanks you out of the open world. It’s honestly so bad that I was tempted to drop it there and then, as it was already starting to wear out it’s welcome and the thought of two whole new areas was making me feel queasy.

I needn’t have worried, as Sonic Team had run out of money. Area 4 can be completed in about 20 minutes, and area 5 is just the other half of Area 1 they’d clearly just chopped in two. As area 1 was probably the best area in the game, this actually worked in the games favour as the level design was a lot less annoying, but it still feels very cheap.

A surprisingly strong point of the game is the story. Sonic has vacillated between embarrassingly edgy and just stupid, and never seems to really nail either a serious or comedic tone. Frontiers goes for a much more subdued, serious story with a small cast of characters and honestly it kind of works. There’s honest to god character development in there, and even though the references to past games can get a little fanservicey it’s nice that they acknowledge and learn from those stories. Now don’t get me wrong, it’s still Sonic the Hedgehog, but I thought it told a surprisingly well crafted story even if the voice direction is a little wobbly.

So overall, I actually quite enjoyed my time with Sonic Frontiers in spite of it’s many, many problems. But would I recommend it to any but the diehard fans? Probably not, as those people have probably played functional videogames in the past and might be rather less forgiving than me.",,
"Spoilers are in this review!

Sonic Frontiers doesn't do anything too outstanding, but it also doesn't need to. It's fun to play and is a good foundation for the future of the series, where they can take this formula and improve upon it.

The story itself is decent and fun to go through, but it shines the most with the character interactions. Though, I found there's a surprisingly small amount of Dr. Eggman, someone I was hoping to see more with this game taking him a bit more seriously, but, he seems setup to do more in a future title (or DLC?) that required the events of Sonic Frontiers to happen first.

Cyberspace isn't as bad as some people make it out to be, but it is certainly the weakest part of the game, Sonic Frontiers shines in the open zones. Boss fights as Super Sonic are very fun overall and I'd love for a way to refight them all, though the true final boss is also VERY disappointing in comparison to these fights.

Soundtrack is great and I can't wait for it to release on streaming platforms.

It is NOT perfect but it's solid and worth your money. Sets a solid foundation for the future of the series.",,
"Best Sonic game in a long while, amazing soundtrack as well.",,
This is the best Sonic has felt in years. Besides a view button issues within some minigames I think it to be a solid 8.5.,,

when is sonic forintiers 2 is coming out",,
actually good sonic game. also getting alot of free dlc in 2023!!!!,,
Although the game has a few bugs and some weird design decisions it screams Sonic in the best way possible. I love almost every aspect of the game except some of the janky mini games and the occasional passing through 2D walls. a solid 7/10,,
"After 100%ing the game, I must say this is definitely one of the best sonic games that have come out from the last decade! All of the worlds were a blast to explore and there were so many collectables to find, it was crazy! This is a massive step in the right direction for sonic and I look forward to future instalments.

The writing and art direction of the game was also insane, got massive goosebumps throughout it. And oh boy don't even get me started on the Titan Boss Fights! Such a great way to end an area. Although, I was really puzzled on the Final Boss once you beat it on hard-mode.

A couple problems I have had though, although this is my fault.. I was getting a lot of stuttering in the first area, but that was because I had my graphics too high and I noticed that my specs were not good enough to run at max graphics. The other problem I had was that there was advertised to be 5 islands, which is true. However, one of the islands is literally just climbing 6 towers and with nothing else to do in-between, no collectables. Which really bummed me out because I'm a sucker for collectathons and was hoping that each island would give me a lot of play time, granted each island took around 6 hours to properly explore and complete but this island only took about 20 minutes at most because of how bare-bones it was.

(this is my personal opinion) A MASSIVE issue I also had was the cyloop. I thought the move itself was amazing and really fresh and inventive however, there were times where you could perform a cyloop and get memory tokens or emerald keys.. which I think completely throws the exploration aspect out the window and could beat this game in probably 7-8 hours instead which sounds really disappointing. But, each to their own. Not everyone would want to explore each island head to toe as they would probably get bored, and admittedly I did get a bit bored on the final island picking up the scraps of the last memory fragments after doing it for so long.

Overall I would give this game a solid 8 out of 10! A breath of fresh air for us sonic fans :)",,
"1. Denuvo
2. 30/60 FPS locked #3 has fixed this one
3. No mods* to fix any of the problems. Hedgemodmanager works now
4. Stuttering, poor performance on a higher end PC.

Still has Denuvo, which is probably responsible for #4, but #3 has fixed #2 with mods removing the FPS lock. But I wouldn't recommend this until Denuvo is gone and you can catch it for under $40 in a sale.",,
"I actually got a refund for the game. I'm surprised this game reached an overwhelmingly positive status on Steam. The controls are janky. Some abilities bug out the camera angles. The story right off the bat comes off lazy and forced. It becomes immediately apparent that this isn't the Sonic Adventure 3 type game that so many of us keep hoping for. Sadly, I can't recommend this in it's current state. Although I'm sure there is plenty to like about it, I just can't get into it. This is coming from a guy who played Sonic Adventure 1 and 2 for hundreds if not thousands of hours. Honestly, this game could have won me over if it at least had Chao Garden but that's a personal gripe. Give me a new Chao Garden game and you'll be getting my cash.",,
"I see how it may be controversial but I really love the open world exploration aspect of this game. It also does have the more traditional sidescrolling and 3D ""arcade"" levels. All in all I like in which direction this is going and I am hoping for more of this in the future. Definitely recommending to give this a try!",,
"The best Sonic game in YEARS.
They made this with love.
This is honestly where the franchise should go from now on, i've had such a blast playing this.",,

Dont buy it ... its buggy as ♥♥♥♥..
fun little game but not worth $60 .. i got 1 hour in and said ♥♥♥♥ this
not worth it",,

The over world exploration is great but everything else is not the best. The boss fights are way to short (Hard Mode) with no option to change the music for them. and the final boss is a crappy gimmick fight. The game is not really worth $60. If you want to see the game just save your money and watch a video of it.,,
"This game is stupid fun, and the best sonic has felt in years. I really wanted this game to succeed, and i was really glad to get my hands on it when it first released. (I initially got the switch version, but since getting a steam deck i got the game on steam too and have been enjoying higher graphics and framerate). Sonic feels awesome, the characters havent felt this alive in a long time, and the overall direction of this game has me really excited.

Now, this game is not perfect. Far from it. The general consensus is that this game is a 7/10, and for sonic that is a miracle in the modern day. However this is the most ambitious, fun, and high-inducing 7/10 i've played.

The movemement in the open zone is really awesome, sonic turns very easily and while boosting you move at a fast pace. You can get a great flow going, moving from obstacle to obstacle. You can run past whatever you dont like, and engage in whatever you find fun.

However, the pop-in is really noticeable and sometimes ruins the flow of gameplay. There have been times where ive been stopped by an invisible wall from an obstacle that didnt load in yet and it is very frustrating. Additionally, the jump kills any sense of momentum you have. For control, this works great. but for speed, it feels pretty bad.

Kronos and Ares island were really fun, i loved the ambient music for both of them and i loved how the game let you freely traverse where you wanted to go. There are many mini obstacle courses throughout the islands and you can choose to go where you want, and if something isnt fun you can just leave it. But just moving around and getting collectibles was really fun. And traversing to any part of these 2 islands were very easy.

The same, however, cannot be said for Chaos island. Chaos island had a frustrating amount of forced 2d segments that you were sent into from any spring or dash pad. It was hard to see what was ahead because of the forced perspective, each section felt sluggish, and overall i found myself ignoring these obstacle courses because i was not having fun with them. Whats worse, is that in the previous 2 islands there would be these markers that you could cyloop to get a lot of memory tokens. Chaos island has these too, but instead of memory tokens they are just springs or dash pads that send you flying into these 2D sections uncontrollably.
Meanwhile, the map is segmented between a bunch of islands and it is really hard to find out how to get where you need to go.

Now most people were upset about Rhea not being a full blown island, but i really liked the break from formula on climbing the towers. The epic music and fun platforming while climbing comically tall towers, all while the dread of watching really grabbed back my attention and made me want to keep playing. And after the mess that was Chaos, when i started ouranos island i was just happy to experience the freedom of kronos island again. It was disappointing to see that it had the same aesthetics, but i still found the last island to be enjoyable.

The combat in this game is definitely new and fresh, but it needs balancing and more incentives. My enjoyment on combat was mixed, sometimes it was very fun and satisfying, sometimes it was a chore. Some of the guardians were really fun to fight! Some of them were just quick time events (looking at you shark) and were far from engaging.
Most combat moves learned from the skill tree were just different finishers used by different buttons, but were functionally the same. Or you get sonic boom, which is just ""hold down the trigger to win"". But then you get a really cool ability like quick cyloop, or tricks which are completely separate from combat! There is a lot of potential, but ultimately the skill tree just needs more unique abilities and not just finishers that look different.
The parry is also incredibly overpowered and abuseable, unlike in other games with parries you can just hold it forever with no sense of timing. You can even cheese the jump rope challenges by holding parry midair, you just float motionless in the air and it does not feel like something that should have made it into the final game.

But there is one thing that the skill tree really augments: the titans. The first 3 titans were some of the most fun and excited i have been playing sonic in such a long time. The music is awesome and pumps you up, the moves are flashy and cool, and everything is over the top in such a spectacular way. And unlike previous games where super sonic has a completely different moveset, your combat abilities now stay the same and instead are super flashy and deal massive damage. The first time i faced giganto i had goosebumps and was screaming out loud. It was so exciting.

On replay though, the epicness does kinda dwindle with the knowledge that you can just hold parry and win really easily. There is no downside to using it all the time, there is no timing to it. The wyvern fight was awesome the first time i played it because i had no idea you could parry the missiles, so i had to dodge left and right while constantly moving. Boosting felt like a risk because i could easily get hit. But on a replay i could just hold parry and skip the chase phase entirely once 1 missile gets reflected. Basically: the titan fights are really easy. Once you get over the awesome music and spectacle they really lack any form of challenge, and aren't as fun as when you first faced them. Its also criminal that there is currently no way to replay any of the titans unless you have a save file you save right before the fight. Though hopefully DLC will fix this.

Cyberspace is a mixed bag, sometimes the levels are really fun and other times they just dont fit sonic's movement well. For some baffling reason they decided to make sonic's turning while boosting in the 3d levels a lot stiffer in cyberspace, which makes playing as intended a lot less fun than it could be. The 2d stages meanwhile are slow and floaty, overall i didnt like them as much
However, with the unintended mechanic of homing attack cancelled boost, you can go zooming past the stages and it is actually a lot of fun. plus, its easy to pull off, all you need to do is press homing attack then hold the boost before you hit anything. Trying to break the intended path to get a very low time has been the most fun i've had with these stages. 1-2 especially, with the absurdly tight S rank time it was realy fun to optimize it. Its a shame no other level has such a tight time like 1-2 did.

The music? absolute god tier. every part of the soundtrack is genius, and ive been listening to the different songs all throughout the game on spotify ever since it released. Every cyberspace level has unique music with different styles, theres a freaking lofi track for fishing, the beautiful melancholic music of the open zone, or the adrenaline pumping metal that plays during the titan fights. There is something for everyone here, and as someone with very wide music tastes i appreciate all of it. (except for that one song that plays during that ONE sage cutscene in chaos island, the singing is off key and it sounds like nails on a chalk board to me. i hate it)
And the music that plays in the credits? The lyrics had me tearing up.

so overall? Sonic frontiers is a mix of a lot of things, many of which are fun but could be better. And yet it gives you so much freedom to do what you want, that you can just skip the parts you dislike. Everything about this game makes me really excited for the future of sonic as well as the DLC. Plus, hearing Kishimoto on twitter actively listen to feedback and talk about him wanting to fix problems with the game has me incredibly hopeful. The highs of this game are incredibly high, and while there are certainly an amount of lows in this game, you either forgive and forget, or you can just ignore them entirely and never have to encounter them. 7/10.",,
"If you're a sonic fan, it's a must have for sure, no question about it. It takes a welcome serious tone and that makes it really neat seeing Sonic interact with the others in ways you don't normally see outside the comics. I nerded out hearing, and seeing all the old material they reference back to for actual story/character growth purposes and not just for a joke.

As for the average person, It's still a rather fun game, but it's not a perfect game in the slightest. The physics are pretty crappy, especially in the ""main stages"". But in the world map, which you can easily spend hours on just going place to place collecting seeds and other goodies, it feels pretty great. It's just fun to run around and parkour everywhere and it honestly satisfies my collectathon / metroidvania itch.

Overall, despite a few gripes that I wish were polished or ironed out (perhaps future mods will fix?), very fun game, was very happy to play and had a good time. If you're still on the fence about it, and in no rush, then by all means wait for a sale. Sonic sales are pretty common. Either way I say it's certainly worth a play through.",,
Cool game. Not 60$ worth though not even close. This is at best worth 30 on a good day.,,
"Wait for a sale, but this is a very solid sonic game, probably my favorite, maybe number 2. It has its flaws, but nothing game breaking. 7.5/10",,
Why is the music so good!?,,
"This game is the 7/10 ever.

It's got a lot of passion and heart, but it's also got a lot of problems. I'm happy to have unironically enjoyed a new Sonic game but there was always, always something holding back any given experience, be it a questionable design decision or a technical issue.
Navigating the open world is more fun than expected, but there isn't enough to do that is challenging and fulfilling, most of it being toddler-level ""puzzles"" or segments that might as well be automated.
Boss fights are insane and full of hype, but the parry is grossly overpowered and trivializes them.
Some Cyberspace levels are good, but whenever I encountered one I recognized, like an SA2 stage, it just made me wish I was playing SA2 instead. 1-2 set a high standard of mastery and got me excited but then the rest were bizarrely generous on S-Ranks.
The story tried harder than almost any other Sonic game, particularly when it came to humanizing Sonic and Eggman, but the plot construction was wonky and the ending felt like to me it was missing a scene or two. I got surprisingly invested, but at the credits I was primarily left with the wistful feeling that it should have been pushed just a little more into something genuinely good and not just good for a Sonic game.

I think that if you love Sonic, or if you used to love Sonic, or if you wish you were able to love Sonic, you should give this game a go. It's worth experiencing. There are mistakes, but there is also passion shining through. You need to go in with tempered expectations, but this is Sonic, so most adults will be used to that already.",,
"It is like Horizon but with Sonic and his level layouts.
You collect stuff to free Sonic's friends. You can also play as them now.
It is fun and it is fast pace.
The down side is you need a rig to play this one on pc. And it is still somewhat buggy.",,
feels like sa2 great game buggy ass gameplay at least the game was good,,
"Fun gameplay in both the open world and linear stages. The stages are very reminiscent of Sonic Generations gameplay and feature remixes of classic Sonic stage bgm.

Over the top boss battles that feature that classic 3D Sonic butt-rock music.

Story is mid, but not bad enough to ruin the whole experience. The typical side-characters all feel and sound very bland.


I'd give this one a solid 7/10",,
"It's a fun Sonic game. It's fun running around, platforming in the open world, taking down mini bosses and enemies with the skills you gain from the skill tree. If you're a more casual fan of Sonic you'll also like the cyberspace stages, though I believe more hardcore Sonic fans won't care for them too much. In my opinion it's the worst part of the game and I avoided it, which is a choice you have which is nice. Definitely the best 3D Sonic game in the last decade.",,
I've only played for 4 hours and it's leagues above forces and most recent sonic games. It really feels like they didn't waste the 5 years they spent working on it and made every second count. This could be a great starting point for sonic games of the future,,
"I can confidently say this, after about 4 hours of gameplay (finishing Kronos Island and Starting Ares Island), Sonic is back! Sonic is Back BABY!

Now I'm not saying this game is 100% the best. It does have it's problems, like the stiffness in Cyberspace Stages, the repetitve fights with same enemies, and a few others here. But those did not take away my enjoyment with the game!

Sonic in the open world controls great, has alot of cool combat moves, and exploring what's around the enviornment is fanatastic. There are tons of improvements to address for the future, but I think what Sonic Team has done with this is a great step in the right direction for the series!

Welcome back, Sonic! I've missed you <3",,

"The game may not be perfect but I love it so much. There are still things left to be fixed like more unique Cyberspace Levels or adjusting physics but overall this game is just awesome. The quality is coming back and the story isn't a huge joke anymore like in past titles in the 2010' era. Music incredible as usual, made me even love the metal songs even though I don't like that genre at all lol. Running around the islands and getting a lot to collect made me not wanting to stop playing for hours on end.

Anyway, get that game and play it. It's just awesome!",,
"Love this game best pre order I have ever done I need more though I really hop dlc is added with more islands and what not this formula is perfect for 3d sonic it took decades BUT THEY FINALLY FOUND IT. The music is hands down the best its been in years metal and punk rock elements blended perfectly with ""sonic rock"" and makes the boss fights 1000% cooler. The only downside I can safely say is chaos island all the other islands are fine with having mini paths to collect but chaos island feels really small with hazards and mini paths almost blocking you from going where you wanna go and then your stuck in 2D its weird because the other islands dont nearly do this as much but chaos island just does. The cyber space stages are great a lil break from the open world for about a min and then you want more and follows the forces of boosting which is ok kinda indifferent about cyberspace stage but hopefully its less or revamped in the next game. This game biggest flaw is there isnt more I am currently starving for more ideas and maps for this game and with the free monster hunter dlc with new mini game best believe I will 100% that as well I currently collected every memory token/max skill/ 100% mapped/ 100% fishing segments/ all S's on cyber space and waiting for the soap shoes to have equipped and currently doing a 0 upgrade challenge I adore this game and is the best 3d sonic game way to go sega this was perfect",,

I really do love this game but It's insanely unpolished and buggy. Wouldn't recommend to a non Sonic fan. Wait for the DLC,,
"SONIC FRONTIERS IS A CERTIFIED GOO!D GAME!

Perfect? No.
Basically perfect? Yep.

Honestly, I have not felt this level of respect emanate from Sonic Team in over a decade.
The open zone game play is solid, the cyber space levels are fun and contain some peak nostalgia.

The CONTROLS are great and the fact that you can customize and tweak Sonic's movement with a variety of options like turning speed, acceleration, bounce height and more really makes this a great game for players of all skill levels as at full tilt I could definitely see Sonic being a handful for players not used to this level rapid movement.

SOUNDTRACK is my GOTY winner hands down, the only game that got me more hyped up to kick ass recently was Devil May Cry V, this soundtrack slaps hard, way above it's weight class.

Cyberspace music is an awesome Drum & Bass, Dubstep, Electro-House buffet that really gets you motivated to haul ass.

The open zones are this chill vibe, melodic, piano tune, similar to what we got with Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Not a direct copy of that game but it is fsimilar enough that the inspiration is clear but it does really work here.

Lastly, those damn boss fights... Yes, oh God yes! I have NEVER seen Sonic Team give Super Sonic this much love and I am here for it.",,
"I kinda like it since I don't know, it's open world adventure ish kind of game, and it's Sonic :) But the subtitles, I don't know who wrote them but I think he wrote them on April fool's :)",,
actual really good sonic game lets gooooooo,,
"promising, up until the last few hours of it, at which point it completely falls apart, dropping it from an 8/10, to a 5, MAYBE 6, if we're being generous.",,
"Product refunded

Currently completely unplayable for me. My pc is more than capable of handling this game, but after I spent way too much time fixing the graphics options crashes so I could even get into the game, I spent 3 hours trying -everything- I could in game and on my pc, it just wouldn't play above like 5fps. Really poor performance seems to be a common issue for a lot of NVIDIA geforce users.

I can't say what I do and don't like about the gameplay itself, since I literally can't play it, but the UI is clunky (I didn't care too much tbh), consistent, repeatable crashes that happen -every- time I navigated through graphics options or whenever I pause the game (the fix I found for the graphics options crashes was from a sonic origins game fix... so they literally haven't even fixed previous well known issues), uses Denuvo, so internet will affect the game and performance and the game will one day be unusable unless they remove that, and performance overall is so poor to a point that the game is -literally- unplayable. All things that would be expected or acceptable out of an early access game, not as much with a full release AAA title at full price that had been delayed significantly to -fix- issues and performance. There are a significant amount of pc users with the same exact problems, and I find it hard to believe the devs didn't notice the game literally not working. It looks like even the switch version runs better.

TLDR, this game does seem to be the best game they have done in decades with some solid music and story, but for me that doesn't mean much since I can't even get past the opening tutorial. After all the delays, they still released a dumpster of a game for the pc version. Them releasing it in such a state has been a refreshing reminder to myself to just forget that I used to love sonic. My bar was really low for this game to begin with. I didn't think I was expecting a miracle, I just wanted to try the new sonic game, but I guess a ""working"" game was too much to ask for.",,
"I have a lot of thoughts about this game and most of them are positive! For your average player, this game is pretty good! It has it's issues: pop-in, cutscene jank, and a little bit too heavy on the item collection, but for most Sonic fans this is the resurgence that we needed:

- The speeds you can reach make this game so satisfying and I really enjoyed flying through the air when I jumped off a rail or flew off the terrain at the right angle. There's a real sense of freedom here.
- The music is phenomenal and is one of my favourite Sonic OSTs to date - I even got goosebumps listening to some of these tracks for the first time.
- The bossfights and even the minibosses/guardians are so much fun to play - some of which I'd consider the best we've ever had in the series.
- It seems like they finally care about series continuity and character development again (please Ian Flynn stick around for future projects!).
- Fishing minigame with lo-fi, need I say more?

Most of all, they're willing to mix up the formula to give the Sonic fans a fresh experience. I can't stress enough that I want to see them continue forward in this direction, maybe making stages more like the open-zone levels and finally figuring out a way to drop the necessity for 2D sections in a 3D game.

With that being said, . They've created a formula that works, now they need to refine it.

For Sonic fans, buy this and I'm sure you won't regret it, especially if you enjoy the storytelling of the Adventure era to Unleashed. Anyone else scrolling by who's interested, maybe pick it up on sale or when there's a price drop if you're feeling a little hesitant? I strongly recommend this regardless, great work overall Sonic Team!",,
good not great.,,
sonic should take his stinky shoes off,,
The Sonic Cycle begins anew.,,
game is so good i bought this specifically for mods,,
"mad fun, best 3d sonic game we got in awhile",,
This game is so awesome i can't express how good it is.,,
"This is easily one of the best sonic games in the entire franchise and can't recommend it enough, can't wait to see what's next!",,
"Like a yacht, its real fun in the beginning. So beautiful, so different, so quick to and fun to drive. But at the end, you are looking for anyway to get rid of it, and get your insurance payout.

in the beginning, the collectathon premise and random rails are quite new and fun! But after 20 hours, you realize that this is the only thing they focused on. Story is cute and all (like a soap opera anime) but it won't carry the average, reasonable person to complete it.

Wait, For. Sale. 30 bucks max. (USD)

Also, why does Sonic's eyelids have less polygons than a ps1 game model?",,
"It was ok, 7/10 at max.
Model popping is awful, cyberspace are just ripped from generations and are extremely repetetive just like the gameplay overall, but the music is good and the story is something new to the series",,

a fresh of breath air for all sonic fans a game we needed years ago but got it now combat is amazing and theres so much to explore highly recommend anyone to play this,,
Easily the best sonic game if not one of. The open world feels refreshing and the cyber space levels feel short enough that they do not overstay their welcome. The soundtrack is absolute perfection and the boss fights as well are easily some of the best in the series. Although lacking in it's supporting cast by numbers each member feels like they have grown exponentially from Sonic Forces. Overall everything in this game is very good and I am very satisfied and glad that SEGA took there time making this game and it was worth waiting for every second of it. 9/10,,
This will not be a game I think everyone will enjoy. It reminds me of the older tony hawk games easy to play but hard to master sort of game play. But as a sonic fan since 1991 this game has brought back my love for this series that was lost for awhile.,,
"The open world is terrible. The camera movement in this game is BAD lmaoo, Sonic fans are gullible and will try to defend this boring game. The game is not worth full price, Get it on sale for like $20. i'll give Sonic Frontiers a solid 6/10 the music and boss fights are the highlighting moments the game offers you.

It's a good direction for the franchise but frontiers with the random rails in the sky plus the boring open world is not it, Sega really looked at ""BOTW"" (Zelda) and copied it's whole flow, In ""BOTW"" the open world always had something going on and in frontiers it's a damn running simulator with nothing worth exploring. if anyone tell's me they had fun exploring in frontiers get Sega's meat out of your mouth.",,
"alight final review of sonic frontiers:

pros:
- good music
- alot to do
- story seems alr
- some animations are nice
- can make u feel pro at times
- feels like im looking out at the countryside (it looks good)

cons:
- clearly unfinnished
- oh my god the hitboxes are dreadfull the ♥♥♥♥ did i get hit by
- locking system is ♥♥♥♥
- things such as rails are just put there floating in midair and it looks ♥♥♥♥ when they could easily be something like train tracks or wires if u really want to go with the cyber feel
- price

final verdict:
wait for it to go on sale, by then the bugs will be patched and it will be cheaper",,
"Probably the only game on my account I won't recommend. It was definitely a step in the right direction, but they still really botched it in multiple ways and I just couldn't bring myself to enjoy it. Here's to hoping the next Sonic game is amazing, as Ian Flynn writes up a storm and the devs WONT BE RUSHED FOR A CHRISTMAS RELEASE PLEASE SEGA",,
sonic,,
"one of the most legit 3D non-throwback games since the adventure series, pretty damn good",,
"The game itself is fine, the songs/music is top notch. For me the Story is okay, the Boss fights are 10/10, and some zones like 3-2, 2-2, 4-6 and 1-6 are the best zones in my opinion because of the music that's in. I liked the game but I had some difficulties on parkouring to get items and some boss fights.
I would give this game 7/10 because It's a good game, but there are some moments where it's hard to do something or beat bosses.

I know there are people who say that:""This game doesn't feel like Sonic and it's weird."" and so on. I know, I also felt that but I was happy for what I had not what people told for the game. This might *not look* a Sonic game anymore like in the 90s, but just be Happy that this game might have something that you like, for me it was everything.

And yeah people have said that ""Why does Sega bring always the same zones like Green hill zone, Sky Sanctuary zone, Chemical plant zone and other zones in almost every Sonic game?"" It's like Green Hill has been brought in many game's, Green Hill should have a rest for a while,
I will totally agree on that, Sega should take old zones that haven't been in a Sonic game for a long time. I will give an example: Emerald Hill zone, Water Palace, Huge Crisis or Aquatic Ruin zone and so much more.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is probably one of the best Sonic games in recent memories. It is so addicting and very fun to explore all the islands and collect everything. I actually 100 percent all the islands and loved every minute of it. The story is actually well written for a Sonic game, and the voice acting is some of the best in the series. My two problems are the pop in that happens with the environment, it was actually hard to see where to go if your objective is on an far away island and you cannot see the rail to it since it has not spawned in. The other disappointing thing was the final boss, but the other bosses are just simply fun and amazing (they remind of Metal Gear Rising: Revengence and that is a good thing.) I highly recommend you pick this game up, whether you are a Sonic fan or newcomer, it simply great.",,
"Finally a Sonic with great game-play mechanics, nice story and tons of content. Overall this is a great game. I will remember it as a great masterpiece.",,
The final boss was touhou for no reason. the lead dev got bullied on twitter into actually fixing his mistakes. new ending makes this game barely over the threshold for good. here is your barely earned positive review,,
"It's not a bad game by any means! Is it a good game though? Honestly, yeah! The islands are beautiful to explore and sort of match the character they are associated with. The story was really fun to go through as well, although, some plot points are a little off. A lot of Cyberspace was fun to go through, and the 2D platformers in the world were entertaining little spectacles to speed through. The fighting system however, was what I'd say was the clunkiest mechanic in the game. It's not AWFUL, but it really could use some polish. But all the new moves were really cool, and while fighting is clunky, it is still super fun.
I'll be honest though, mods can make this game significantly better such as better shading for the sweet eye candy, or animations that have more personality and polish. It makes me wonder why the devs didn't think of things that modders have, but the fact they have decided to outright say they think of modders as ""rivals"" is really cool and shows that they really want to put everyone they got into satisfying us with the blue blur we all love.

The recent ""Final Horizon"" update really changed things up and was a lot of fun to go through. I won't lie, it was INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT. But I'm glad that the devs gave us a challenge after everyone called the game way too easy. It was deserved on our part. Aside from gameplay though, it expands a lot on some questions we had after playing the initial game. Things are answered, and I really appreciate that. I think Sonic Frontiers is an excellent foundation to pave the way for Sonic to rid himself of the clown title he gained from Sonic Forces. If there's one thing I could change about this game? Better graphics, or better mystery within the story.

Oh, and the best thing about this game is its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ MUSIC. They ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ COOKED. I love you Kellin Quinn. Oh, and you too I guess Roger. (I really prefer Jason Griffith but I believe Roger made significant improvements with this game. His performance does not go unnoticed. Wonderful work.)",,
"TLDR: Buy the Game if it is on Sale. It Needs A lot More Content to be Worth Your Money.
To start off on a good note, I think this has to be the best Sonic 3D game in the last decade.

Sadly, the bar for Sonic games has reached a big low to the point where this is actually amazing compared to the few Sonic games that came out before this one. Frankly this game is too expensive for the lack of content in game. I hope that SEGA takes what they have here but add a lot more story and gameplay elements to this, as this isn't complete ♥♥♥♥ like the other games.

I think, personally that I would of liked this game a lot more if there was any endgame elements to the game. Take for example the Chao Garden, time attack, or literally anything. As soon as you finish the game that's it, nothing else really takes place. They give you no incentives to 100% the game, they have added some cosmetics to change Sonic's appearance like the soap shoes but they don't implement cosmetics in the game to earn at all, they don't even add the option to turn into SUPER SONIC. Which has been a major crutch to this franchise and this story, but they don't do anything else afterwards the story.

Yes, there's many other things that need fixing like the world popping in but if the game was bugless it would be at most a 20-30$ game. I hope they can make a fusion of Sonic Adventure 2 and the open world of this game, that would leave something remarkable.",,
"Finally a 3D Sonic game the public loves, deserved more recognition in TGA. (Especially since it lost to a 2020 game that cheated)",,
"Amazing Sonic game in a long while. Small Enemies and Bosses are way more creative than just the usual dash n' kill stuff that we all know from Sonic games, the music is amazing (as always) and the free roaming is just such a fun experience again which we all hoped for! Combining different rails and bouncepads and just parkouring around just feels great and satisfying. Of course the game is not perfect as there are some visual glitches like when you go fishing or the camera issues sometimes (which to be fair have been in pretty much every sonic game so far, as it is very difficult to get right). And as a fast paced gamer, I do notice the input issues sometimes like some random cooldowns inbetween some inputs and some weird preventing of input combinations like not being able to home-dash randomly after jumping on a bounce pad... Sometimes they are frustrating, but you can work around them.
Overall, a must have game for all sonic fans and a very nice change to the recent sonic game ~fails~.
Game time ~17 hours if you do a bunch of challenges and exploring etc. instead of just rushing through.
(Please make Sage canon for the Sonic franchise. It's a great character! Thank you! <3)

Review Update for the latest Final Horizon Update:
Another 5-6 hours playtime, makes the final boss 100000% better and the ending way more amazing! Definitely recommend doing the new update storyline! <3",,

Awesome but the final boss is disappointing and needs a boss select mode but you can use mods for that.,,
As Sonic fan am happy. is good. please play.,,
"Not perfect by any means - but a pretty damn good time, especially by Sonic's recent standards. Tons of jank and the pop-in is pretty notable but honestly it rarely actually affects the gameplay.",,
better call saul kart better tho,,
An open world game for people who hate open world games (me). Also sonic is there,,
"The base was fine and update 1 and 2 made the game much better, but update 3 messed everything up with performance issues and the towers. The difficulty spike of the new towers is unacceptable, the boss rush is basally impossible with out cheats or being a god, and the final boss is repetitive and overly buggy. the only part I like about this 3rd update is the new characters which are all more fun than sonic. I recommend you just look up the ending as the state of the game is awful.",,
"I'll keep that relatively short because I think everything has already been said in the other reviews. This game is the best 3D Sonic game in the last decade, which isn't really saying much. The gameplay is really fun on the Open Zone. The music is terrific. And the story, my god, the story. It's surprising how well a story can be told when the writer not only has a passion for the franchise, but also knows what the fans really want.
Points of criticism for me are on the one hand the cyber level (I mean especially you 1-2), the repetitiveness especially if you want to do 100% and the cumbersome leveling up (I'll talk to you Elder Koco).

All in all a great game for Sonic veterans and those stepping into the franchise for the first time",,
h-hell yeah!,,
"This game is quite amazing but it really did get snubbed at the 2022 Game Awards.

Oh, well. At least Bill Clinton got nominated....",,
gave me a mad adrenaline rush. i love how it feels like the old and the new coming together. a hand for SA3 !,,
"Let me preface this with: I like Sonic. I've played Sonic games for many years. And I wanted this game to be good and something I could enjoy. And to be fair, it was for the first couple islands.

But this game has very, VERY glaring issues, both by design and not, and with the way it has been made I simply cannot recommend that anyone pay asking price for this installment.

Many aspects of the game share a similar aspect: good at the start, worsening as it goes on, and straight up bad towards the end. The world design? Pretty good initially! The first two sections of the game had good open world design and involved the player in good exploration. The portal levels you have to play for keys? Decent at the start, as they mostly allowed for 3D motion and while only from Green Hill, Chemical Plant or Sky Sanctuary (with one exception), all refreshing at the start of the game. The story? Engaging to begin with, encapsulating the player in mystery and wonder.

But that's the thing. At the start. Initially. To begin with. As the game goes on, all of these aspects of the game worsen. The gate levels in the 'cyber space' are almost exclusively two-dimensional, both in complexity and literally - they only allow movement left or right. This is an issue that 3D Sonic games have had for a long, LONG time - having a full extra dimension to play with, but willingly not using it to make simpler, cheaper, less engaging levels presumably due to lack of time or laziness. On top of that, they continue to only be in the theme of 3 areas, which made them stale very, VERY quickly. However, this is made even more inexcusable when it bleeds into the OPEN WORLD, THREE-DIMENSIONAL EXPLORATION!

I was shocked when the third island's exploration was almost exclusively two-dimensional. Most of the transportation, rail grinding, collectible-collecting was in 2D. Hell, even one of the preliminary boss fights when you first meet the Titan of the area, was two-dimensional. The game after that got blander and blander, to the point where I was constantly complaining in my mind about the absurd decisions made in the development of a 3D open world game.

Even the story made less and less sense as it went on. I won't spoil anything here (though I don't think many would care), but I can put it simply with the statement that stuff that isn't explained initially and is brought to more pondering later, ends up not really ever being explained by the time the end of the game comes. Some cutscenes that are critical to the game's lore and story just end up making more questions for the player that aren't even encased in wonder; they're born out of confusion and exasperation at the pitiful job done by Sega and Sonic Team this time around.

As much hype as there was with this game and the whole debate about Genshin Impact and Sonic Frontiers at the Game Awards, I cannot give this game anything more than a 5/10. I still have trouble pushing myself to finish the game because I can't see myself suffering through more of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ slog. Adding in the constant confusion and frustration this game gave me as a result of its poor decisions and world exploration past the second of five islands, and this is a fat 'Do Not Buy' for me.",,
"It may give off BotW vibes, but overall, I think this a good step back into the 3D Sonic games that we used to love.",,
"no 6 hour s*x scene with robot twins.

Great game!,,
"PEAK FICTION PEAK FICTION PEAK FICITION


Jokes aside I want this formula to flourish in the next games, as many things held it back from being a really great game. They got many things right, the story written by Ian Flynn feels right it's been Black Knight since we have depth with the characters and the gameplay was mixed, cyberspace was really heavy, pop-ins and graphical issues were present, but the open zone could even be a great formula for a Sonic Adventure remake or a successor. This should be a foundation for future sonic games and it is special.",,
"This game is incredible! Greatest Sonic game in years, and plays incredibly. I can't suggest buying this game enough, especially since the boss fights those were just incredible. If you're on the fence, don't be. BUY THIS GAME.",,
"yes there are nitpicks I could make about this game, there are very easy changes that could be made to some elements of this game that could make it just a little better but I can easy overlook those since this one of the best sonic games to come out in years. clear and easy to follow story and there weren't any moments I felt that could've been cut.",,

"The sonic team redemption ark. An open level game with fighting, move set's, and ability's that isn't just boosting, double boosting, and triple boosting. Overall great game, also glad to see the sonic team getting their game on.

PS: The boss fight's and music in this game are the best thing's. (everything in the game is good tho.)",,
"Sonic Frontiers is a rough game but a step in the right direction for the Blue Blur, (if they don't abandon the concept that is). The game is plagued by nasty pop-in, random junk placed haphazardly all over the place, bland Ubisoft-style open-world design, and a whole slew of nitpicks. But despite all that, I had a really good time. I think the concept of Sonic finally being able to stretch his legs in big open spaces is what distracted me from the issues that plague this game. I hope Sonic Team sticks with the concept and greatly expand upon it to get a truly great 3D Sonic game. I hesitantly recommend this if you think you think the open-zone design will be enough to keep you entertained.

Check out my Curator Page!",,
"Honestly a great game. It has pretty big flaws: sometimes the delivery in lines is awkward, a character or two have voices that don't really fit their character, the challenges and mini bosses interrupt your gameplay often, the animators still have no idea eyelids are not eyebrows and do not bend and curve to show emotion, and there are a lot of unnecessarily long pauses when traversing U.I. But when this game does something right, it does it REALLY right! The music is absolutely beautiful, Sonic's tight controls are so comfortable, so many customization options in the menu, the story is absolutely brilliant (I cried in the credits, I hardly ever cry during a game), combat is very fun with all the different ways you can beat the crap out of enemies, and the characterization in the game's writing is PERFECT!

I very well might play the whole game a second time. Get this game. Support it. Make sure Sonic Team knows THIS is how you make a Sonic game.
Sonic is back, baby.",,

sonic game,,
"Best 3D Sonic game I've played in 11 years. This game was very personal to me, just learning Ian Flynn was going to be the lead writer got me excited for the story, but I did have my concerns for gameplay.
Speaking of gameplay, OH MY GOD I LOVE THE OPEN ZONE AREAS! There is so much to do and so much to see, this game is almost perfect in my eyes. Of course there's a few issues but they rarely show up and when they do it's pretty funny.

One thing I think ruins a lot of the game are the cyberstages, first of all it's just re-using the same themes over and over. I really hate how SONIC TEAM keeps re-using green hill and Chemical plant and I hope this is the last time.
But in terms of gameplay the cyberstages aren't really that fun... There are a few I personally enjoyed which were the ones that had the same level design from SA2. But everything else was just not fun, and you feel so slow compared to the open world areas which is the best part of the game.
There's a few more things but nothing to really note on. ALSO! The story is so good! We haven't had a Sonic game with a good story since Unleashed and that was 14 years ago!

I hope SEGA and SONIC TEAM learn from this and improve on this new style. With the right Ideas we could have a new adventure game, maybe not 3 but something that would be a lot like adventure but maybe a lot better. I am a lot more hopeful for this franchise going forward. And I hope SEGA and SONIC TEAM do not go take a step backwards again.",,

everyone mad with the third update has a skill issue,,
"Good comeback for Sonic, open-world is perfect for this playstyle. The Cyberspace levels should use the open-world movement, would be more fluid. The last 2 islands are very obviously rushed, but nothing too distracting from the whole package. A solid 8/10, with a play-style that should be used and improved in the future. Can't wait for the rest of the DLCs!",,
"Very cool, want to see more open zone Sonic
Fun challenges and combat
Cyberspace is nice but the stages are short
I wish it had more to do in the open zones after finishing the story
Story is very good, much character development, mid ending
A great sonic game",,
"Sonic has had a damn good year, hasn't he? A fantastic movie, a flawed but decent collection of Classic Sonic games, a new Netflix show, and even a new main series installment that didn't end up sucking! Good for him!

I'll try not to spoil anything major when writing this, but Sonic Frontiers is a pretty good game. I'll say right off the bat though, this is not like other Sonic games. It clearly takes a Breath of the Wild approach where you can freely explore and do the challenges in the order you wish to proceed in the story. Overall, I'd say it worked enough, but there are plenty of things this game could vastly improve on.

The game is kinda jank, not a lot of extremely problematic bugs, (only encountered one that softlocked me) but occasionally this does lead to very annoying moments such as with boss fights. The combat is very cool-looking until you realize that it is one-note. The puzzles are easy and require little to no effort the majority of the time, among other minor things too.
Also, spoiler complaint incoming:

With all that, you'd assume that this is just another crappy Sonic game...to which I thankfully disagree this time. A definite improvement over Sonic Forces in terms of gameplay, that's for sure. All that stuff above might kinda suck, but at least you've still got that thrilling high-speed gameplay we've come to love 3D Sonic for. (Or, at least the 3D Sonic games) In both the Cyberspace levels and overworlds, Sonic controls mostly great and is extremely fun to get around with his moveset.

As far as presentation goes, it's interesting for sure. While I found the voice direction weird, I think the story was entertaining enough. The gloomy tone gives this game more of an identity, and the music is great as always!

All in all, I think this is still a good game. It has many problems, but also potential. If Sega ever attempts a Sonic game like this in the future, I hope they improve upon all of these. Things like the jank, the combat, the puzzles, yeah it just ain't it chief. Thankfully, the Sonic gameplay is enough to save it for me. Here's to another good Sonic game!",,
i love you sonic the hedgehog <3,,
Hot take: I think this is a better BOTW than BOTW,,
"The game is playable and it is not buggy but there are so many things to fault with the overworld, narrative, presentation, looks, ui and more. It would be frustrating to list them all so lets just say this is not a good game but it is a playable one.

Edit: I am currently playing world 3 i have discovered several more issues i have with the game by now so my initial assessment that it is a playable game i laugh at. Yes you can play the game but not in a pleasant way and world 3 itself? Pure and utter garbage. Only reason i am still playing is that i paid money for this and the achievements doesn't look troublesome to finish. When i got them all i am erasing this game from my memory and never gonna revisit it.",,
Didn't expect to love a Sonic Game ever again. Love the game so far.,,

Im pissing on the moon,,
"Alright, after finishing the game (dw no spoilers, just a rating) this game is a 7/10.
But with a couple of mods this game goes up to a 8.5/10, because physics mods made this game so much better.

Regardless I 100% recommend this game, huge step up from forces.",,
"2 hours in Frontiers: 1 Chaos Emerald found, just barely started exploring and unraveling the story. Challenging boss fights that teach you new skills and mechanics with incremental difficulty.

2 hours in Forces: the game is over.

Lots of improvements and tweaks for Sonic's movement in this game to get it the way you want. Good for newcomers or veterans. Lots of fun , lots of replay value and lots of content.",,
"Watching the first trailers, made me mixed with the game, but, after the last few, I was hyped. I preordered this bad boy, and after giving it a whirl, I'm surprised. This game is more or less Marvel's Spiderman, combined with Mario Odyssey, but with beatiful sonic. Movement is the best we have seen since the adventure games and even being a game just without the sonic branding, its honestly a solid 8/10. Highly recommend you give this a go.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is a fantastic first step into a new, bright and uplifting future for an IP that has been dealt a kind hand this year. While not perfect, it's the right remedy for a series that has lost the solid foundation needed to keep consistent quality games up.

Frontiers' main selling point is it's 5 Open Zones. Kronos, Ares, Chaos, Rhea and Ouranos. Each island, whenever having their own identity or follow trends of a previous island, all look fantastic. You'll find Puzzles that unlock your map. While not difficult, i appreciated the change in functionality. From solving a tile path puzzle, playing hoops with your Homing Attack or running to set locations, there is variety. You'll also come across platforming challenges, with either 3D or 2D perspectives. Some can be integrated into the environment while majority float in the sky. I really enjoyed them, but due to Pop-In issues and lack of environmental attachment for most platforming challenges, breaks some immusion.

You'll also come across Cyber Space Levels, that feature you in 3D/2D levels set in digital reconstructions of past environments. Sonic 1's Green Hill, Sonic 2's Chemical Plant and Sonic 3's Sky Sanctuary all appear, with a Highway level similar to City Escape from Sonic Adventure 2. You'll also find Level Design from games like Sonic Unleashed, Generations and even Adventure 2. While controls took time to get used too, i did really enjoy my time with these stages.

You can also fight enemies. From small soldiers to large towering guardians, Combat was always fun for me, and the Titian fights were incredibly memorable.

The Soundtrack, a staple for any Sonic game, shows more range than ever. From Beautiful and somber orchestral pieces for the Islands, calming and ancient sounding chants for the Elder and Hermit Koco's. Energetic and rhythmic EDM Cyber Space Music, to 2000's Metal music for the Titan Boss Fights, the OST presents a large catalogue that is a true accomplishment. With 6 Composers, this OST can be seen as one of, if not the best of the Sonic series. Well worthy of an award.

The Story is one of the series' best. Fleshing out and developing these characters we've come to know and love. Sage, the new character for the game, is one of my new favourites. I won't say anything more, but if you're someone that has kept in close ties to the series' legacy, even outside of the games, you'll find callbacks that hit home for you.

Sonic Frontiers is something special, and, while with it's own set of issues, it's best elements fly any negativity to the side to have one of the most enjoyable and magical experiences. Giving a fair rating, it's a strong 8/10, but as a fan, it edges out to a soft 9. It's defiantly worth a pick up, and i highly recommend it.",,

"Fantastic return to form for Sonic, It's clear that Sonic Team made a game they wanted to make and it shows. truly a passion project and love letter to lifelong fans of the Blue Blur!",,
"This game seems just as vital and groundbreaking for Sonic as Mario 64 was for Mario. It's been a long time since I've been this floored and impressed by a game.

10/10 for Story, Sound, Music, Mechanics, Variety, Graphics, Length, and most importantly Fun. I can't remember the last time I had this much fun playing a video game. I love Elden Ring, but fun isn't necessarily a word I would use to describe that experience.

My easy and obvious pick for GOTY

This is the exact video game I would wish for to exist throughout my 25 years of being a gamer. No notes.",,
"The story goes nowhere. *Spoilers* The most interesting part of the story is watching sonic save his friends and slowly become more and more corrupted until he's full corrupted and can no longer move and is stuck in limbo between dimensions for ALL OF 10 SECONDS before Amy, Tails and Knuckles do absolutely F******* nothing and just basically tell him to snap out of it and he magically fine. Lazy writing.",,
"Just finished the game and honestly didn't feel it was worth it even though I got it on sale. Sonic Generations to me is still the last best Sonic game besides Mania. Gens is way more enticing to go back and play again than Frontiers.

Frontiers cyber-space levels are too short, too easy, no real challenge or great visuals that make me wanna play them again, and I'm not really bothered for any I missed either. The music doesn't feel like it belongs in a Sonic game. There's a few times where it does sound kinda cool, but most of it feels uninspired techno music and doesn't make me feel a sense of speed or wanting to go fast. If you're going to reuse Green Hill, maybe remixing the music or reusing motifs in different ways for each level would be nice. Just something with more energy! Also the level that makes Sonic drift with the special boost pads controls so poorly, I don't understand why it was implemented. I just jump over them so I don't driftly wildly. Trying to make Sonic move along the path when it turns feels stiff and awkward, being able to drift like in Gens in these parts would've been an improvement.

The open world feels half baked. It was fun to run around and do all the little platform challenges at first, but between that and the short cyber-space levels, it's unsatisfying for a full game play experience. The puzzles are barely worth mentioning, I don't think running in a hamster wheel can count as a puzzle. The only ones I truly liked are racing to press the triangle buttons. More puzzles that actually utilized Sonic's speed and platforming would've been more enjoyable. By the last island, I just did the fishing minigame to get the collectibles and finish the game, avoiding enemies whenever I could. I even downloaded some mods to fix minor issues like the slow leveling up with the Elder Koco. I still played a few of the cyber-space levels but still nothing worth of note.

This game overall feels all over the place and unfocused. Generations had better challenges and platforming. Bayonetta's and DMC's combat have much more depth. Sonic Speed Simulator on ROBLOX has way better sense of speed, better controls, and a better world to just run around in even without any objectives. It fully gives the player control that you have to align yourself to run the loops or you may go flying compared to Frontier's platforming being half automated. Maybe if the cyber levels were condensed to a fewer but longer levels, then I'd have more reason to go back to this game. But overall, this game feels sorely lacking.

----3/7/23
Updating my review because I felt pretty let down after the final boss being a galaga shooter minigame. Listening to the cyberspace ost on youtube, I actually like these songs turns out. I think the gameplay itself is just lacking speed, Sonic feeling sluggish and stiff turning.

Something more they could've done with the islands is form the terrain itself as platforms for Sonic to run through instead of heavily relying on floating platforms and rails. Didn't like it when I'm running around and I get stuck in another 2D section even though I already completed it. It's very ironic when I could just run straight to the location I want and I can see it in the background, but instead I'm stuck in moving only in 2D in an Open Zone game.",,

"So from what I have played (On PS4 & Steam) I will say this, and keep it straightforward.


Gameplay wise, The OPEN WORLD experience absolutely obliterated my expectations. I love how this game plays, honestly. Making an open world Sonic game was a genius move by Sega. Sonic's movements are fleshed out so well because of the amount of space you have to run around with, something that other sonic games struggle with often. The cyber space levels do however struggle with unoriginality and bad level design quite often though. Do avoid some of these levels if possible. (Big's Fishing Game)

I also love the graphical style of this game. It feels very real and authentic. This game takes a very serious and realistic tone with its story, AND its environments. This shows in pretty much every Island you explore in. I will say, character animations are pretty stiff and lackluster at times. This could be improved upon for future games.

The story is the best in a Sonic game... Easily. This is the only actually GOOD Sonic story out of any of the games. I'm sorry to say but all the other ones suck story wise. And the fact that this game managed to shift the tone of the entire sonic franchise single-handedly is VERY Impressive. You just have to experience it for yourself honestly.

Sonic Frontiers is my new favorite 3D Sonic game. It surely could be improved upon in MANY, MANY areas, but for what this beautiful game offers, It gains my respect.",,
"- Sonic Frontiers is the first time in a long time I can confidentially say Sonic is going in the right direction. I genuinely enjoyed my experience with it. It's a huge step up from the last modern Sonic title, in every way possible. Despite it still running on the Hedgehog Engine, it feels almost completely different from previous outings on the same engine. Different in a good way. From the first moment I was able to take control, I was excited with the changes. While it's a departure from the momentum focused mechanics that I most praised in Sonic Adventure, it still feels excellent for a boost style game.

A lot of people will compare this to a certain other open world game, but my first impression with it left me thinking it was more inspired by SEGA's own Phantasy Star Online 2: New Genesis. In particular, the closed off zone style maps, and the enemy design. While I wish it took more inspiration from Sonic's own history, I still like it. That said, it certainly pays homage to Sonic's history by way of dialogue between characters. It's loaded with mentions of happenings from past games, although it plays into it too much at times. To the point that they're talking about it just for the sake of bringing it up. The dialog itself is phenomenal, some of the most natural writing the series has seen. I hope to see more like it in the future.

The story is okay. I enjoyed it enough. The theme feels a little more serious and a little less whimsical from previous entries. And the stellar soundtrack matches that. It was cool seeing an origin story for the chaos emeralds. I'm typically bullish on new characters, but in this instance, I like Sage, Eggman's ""daughter."" She works, and works well. I'd like to believe she was inspired by the popular fan character Omelette. Please confirm, SEGA?

As a whole, I'm impressed with Sonic Frontiers. They went the extra mile with this one, and it shows. Highly recommended to any Sonic fan. This is my first impression with this game, and as such, I might update this review in time.

This title runs perfectly on Linux, and requires a tad bit of tinkering to optimize it for Steam Deck.",,
"This game is a true celebration of the Sonic franchise. It ties together gameplay and narrative elements from the entire mainline series, retroactively makes the previous games better, and has highly rhythmic movement and combat mechanics. Strongly recommended, provided you can deal with the usual jank that comes with high-speed platforming.",,
"I could recommend this to die-hard sonic fans, but I'm hesitant to do even that. The shining point of this game is that Sonic is headed in a better direction, and you can see the potential. Something about the game was legitimately empty in a lonely, depressing kind of way that brings me back to Shadow of the Colossus, but in a way that feels incredibly un-sonic like.

For me, the game needed brighter music inspired from older games. The gameplay isn't bad, but again the world is empty and at 4 hours in, so is the story. I just couldn't get into it. I see a lot of reviews that praise the characters for being better than the past games, and I have to say... why are we using that as the bar? The creative leads behind this game did a good job bringing sonic into a free roaming open world... but unfortunately they did it without any of the open world goodness (towns, quests, npc's, a living, breathing world). It's not impossible to imagine this. Use inspiration from the comics or something. Sonic Team needs to consider how to make a game engaging, immersive, fun. For me, this was not it.

It's possible that bringing warmer colors and sunshine into this game would have improved it slightly, perhaps there's a reshade option somewhere, lol. I could find and play some Sonic inspired music online or with Spotify... maybe I'll try that out and see if it helps. It probably won't make this feel like any less of a tech demo, though.",,

"There were some attempts in the past to transfer Sonic into an open world amongst the fans. But those trials were mostly blueprints or just big sandboxes with nothing much to do in it, like Sonic Utopia for example. With Sonic Frontiers (SF), it's the first time we have a really true official open world Sonic game.

Firstly, before everything else, we have to talk about the design of SF. Sonic games are known for their vibrant colors, their energetic music, their unique art styles inspired by the 80's and their overall dynamism. There's (almost) none of that here, although the boss fights are really shounen-like. But, overall, SF is quite bland. Artistically, I would compare it to Shadow of the Colossus, but there was a true beauty in the desolation there, not so much here.

The best way to describe SF is as a collectathon. You do short platforming sections and simple puzzles to collect memory tokens to progress the story, you fight normal enemies and titans to collect gears to unlock cyberspace stages, you do short cyberspace stages to collect vault keys to unlock the 7 chaos emeralds, and finally you use the emeralds to fight the boss of the island to unlock the next island. And once you reach the next island, you lose all the emeralds and begin anew. As you can see, SF is quite formulaic and it becomes more boring the more you progress. But, even as formulaic as it is, its best strength is that it's a true open world Sonic game.

The classical platforming Sonic is known for is now accompanied by the free roaming the open world allows and a new combat system introduced here. With the openness comes a character action kind of gameplay, although it's quite simple here. You can do combos, dodge, parry and use some special skills to defeat your opponents. But like I said, it's simple. There's only one combo, the window for the parry is extremely generous, and most of the skills are superfluous, except for Sonic Boom that allows you to shoot infinite projectiles. Most enemies are easy but some are a pain to deal with, not because they are difficult but because of the gimmick used to defeat them.

It's sad to admit it but the roaming is underwhelming. Although it's exhilarating to finally be able to control Sonic in an open area, SF mostly misses the mark. Most of the traversal, except when you run, are done by using rails; and it is also the same for the platforming sections. If you're not familiar with Sonic's gameplay, that means: you touch a bumper/spring/pad and Sonic is thrown forward, then you have to use the homing attack to reach a new bumper/etc. or enemy to progress further. It's something that's straight from the 3D games. Why this is underwhelming is because the open world here is nothing more than a background and being thrown forward is also what you do the most in SF.

There are 5 islands but the only thing that will change between them is the environment (and I say 5 but that's not really the case), the types of enemies you fight and the puzzles you solve. You'll find rails/bumper/springs/pads on the first island and the same on all the other ones. It's like adding a snowy stage to a platformer and not put any slippery surface in it, no frozen trap/section, no windy section, or no snowboarding/surfing section. The lack of any new interaction with the environments and the repetitiveness aggravate the boredom one can feel while playing SF, especially when it's so bland to look at. The other problem with all those rails is how they just pop in; they don't feel part of the environment. All of that makes SF feels pretty boring, artificial and incoherent, visually speaking.

Sonic Frontiers feels kind of incomplete, or lackluster. The puzzles are extremely simple and the platforming sections are repetitive. About the cyberspace stages, in my opinion, they are totally superfluous: the game should have been only an open world game without those extremely short interludes, especially when it's known that Sonic Team is not the best at them, mainly when they are in 2D. Fortunately, they are short although some of them overstay their welcome (like the 3-6). Or maybe, they should have been integrated directly into the open world.

Fighting the end titans of each island is an interesting experience, albeit particularly chaotic. It can be hard to know when to parry, simply because the action is overwhelming and it's hard to read their patterns. They are also full of QTE. But the direction of the fights make them a good spectacle (but it is still stupid to lose the emeralds each time you reach a new island - but I guess that fits the formulaic part of the game to a t). And then there's the (true) last boss... Let's just say that it is ""surprising"" yet disappointing.

Sonic Frontiers is an ok game and an interesting foundation to build the future of the series upon, let's just hope Sonic Team will do just that. Now, if you're a fan, as you can see with all the positive reviews, you might like it. If you're not, then it depends on your tolerance for just a ""ok game"" and a fairly repetitive one at that.",,
i want to make love with The End,,
speed.,,
"(Apologies if there is bad english its not my native lenguage) Sonic Fronteirs is a very fun game that you will love if you are a long time sonic fan. However the game has a low render distance wich means that there are a lot of popings, but this is only usualy annoying in the first island.
The cyber space levels are fine but very sort and they only have 4 level aesthetics, so you are going to see green hill a lot of times.
The combat and controls in general are fine but the parry is very op and some moves kill sonic momentum.
The open world is very fun and has a lot of challenges for the player to do, but bewear if theres a slope because sonic will rapidly fall while running (ok it isn't that exagerated) but like the popping you will get used to it.
In general sonic frontiers is a good game but it has some mistakes that can annoy some players, in my oppinion it's an 8/10",,

Works well on steam deck. Really fun game so far,,
"The most ambitious Sonic the Hedgehog game in over a decade.
It won't be for everyone, with it's highly experimental world design, but if you're a fan of the series, especially the first two Adventure titles, it's worth checking out.

PROS:
+World is full of all kinds of platforming challenges, many of which tend to go more deep than recent titles' level design (ex: Forces)
+Art direction is generally very pretty on the eyes, and the music is phenomenal as always for Sonic, this time going even a step beyond the usual expectations with many pleasant surprises
+Boss fights are all highly inventive and creative with simple yet fun combat, super sonic fights being a massive highlight of the experience

CONS:
-Game has a heavily apparent lack of polish in many areas (though shouldn't be surprising for long-time fans, especially of the ""Dark Ages"" and ""Meta Era"" titles)
-Feel and controls of the linear ""Cyber Space"" stages are abysmal, feeling way too stiff for their own good (in contrast to the best-in-class feeling controls of the open zone parts of the game)
-Endgame is a disappointment for an otherwise refreshing and interesting story

All in all, I think this game has a lot of problems, but I'm able to overlook many because of the sheer amount of content in this game I genuinely enjoyed. Again, it won't be for everyone, but if an open-zone collectathon sounds up your alley, I highly recommend it. There's a lot to love, even with the lack of polish in some areas, just like the Sonic games of the 2000s that are beloved by me.",,
"An open world is a great next step for Sonic gameplay. Running around a huge landscape at super fast speeds is super satisfying, especially when there's no shortage of little challenges along the way. And for the first time in about 10 years we got a story that was actually interesting and fun to follow along. The characters are interesting again, and they have really fun interactions.

There's still a lot to be improved. While the gameplay is fun when going really fast, when the game suddenly stops your momentum and slows you down unexpectedly, it's jarring. Forces did the same thing at times, but this is nowhere near that level of jank.

The cyberspace levels are fun most of the time, but there's not a whole lot of drive to complete them all. A lot of them are copies of old levels from SA2 and Unleashed, which is a neat idea in that you sorta have a cool ""hey I know this level layout"" moment, but later falls a bit flat when you realize you could be running around the big vast world, or if you wanted to play those old levels, you could go play that old game. But it just goes to show how good those old designs were, they still manage to hold up with a totally different set of physics applied to them.

Biggest gripe is that stupid elder koco. I should not have to level up 1 level at a time. Took 20 minutes to drop all my kocos to him to level up once. Maybe this could get patched out or modded in the future for more ease of use?

Even my gripes considered, it's refreshing to have a fun and interesting Sonic game again!",,
W game,,
"How did they get away with making the best Sonic montage ever for their lead promotional video?

If you want to see just how wild this game is, check out the cyberspace speedruns. The skill ceiling is bonkers high in this game. Worth every cent!",,
"Well, where to even begin on this. As an old man who really has steered clear of any sonic games that weren't side scroller platformers, and who adored the old genesis games, and even the 8 bit era of sonic, I was reluctant to try this. But I gave it a go anyway as it was getting positive reviews. So here's my drivel about the game.

This game does so much right, but so so much wrong. You are repeatedly forced into these weird mini game scenarios which entirely gate the progression of the game. They aren't optional, you must complete them, and each is more ridiculous and annoying than the last. For example there was a drawn out, really boring, really shallow part where I found myself playing pinball, which no one asked for, was terrible, and absolutely could not be skipped.... and honestly that wasn't even the worst of it.

The third world is a gigantic slog, which i only managed to get through by drinking a large amount of rum and basically forcing my way through it.

By the fourth world, you are basically ready to wrap things up because you're well and truly over it by then, which is interesting because it appears the developers were equally as over it by then as the player, because the fourth and fifth world's are just reskins of the first world.

I lost track of the story somewhere along the way (lost interest in it), but i did notice sonic was suffering from a gigantic headache after the third world, which checks out, because I was too. I don't know what sonic's headache was all about, but maybe he was just tired, tired of the decades of abuse from sega and the sonic team, and all the various other content creators that have bashed this IP over the head over the years.

What i did see of the story was kinda weird, knuckles for example had no real explanation as to why he was there, he just kinda showed up, and basically said as much.... The interactions between the characters were downright awkward and weird by the way. I don't know why they persist with having dialogue in sonic games, the voicing is terrible, I mean mario has never said much more than 'its a me..' and everyone loves him.

Why isn't it robotnik anymore btw? Eggman doesnt strike fear into the hearts of his enemies at all, Robotnik was a perfectly cromulent bad guy name tbh.

Some new character, I had never seen before showed up at one point and gave me a fishing rod.... this character appeared to be suffering from an intellectual disibility or something, but it was handy, because I had collected an enormous amount of purple coins by then, and managed to buy my way through the final world without having to do anything by simply fishing... And thank goodness, because I really couldn't be bothered anymore.

The cringe was just next level, all the way through. That's a whole paragraph right there which I won't even finish writing.

The super sonic boss fights were cool i guess, despite the cringey music, which to be fair, I guess I would've enjoyed if I was a hormonal 13 year old boy, which was probably the target market here, so I won't begrudge them too much. But what I will say, is almost all the super sonic fights, whilst cool managed to be ruined by some lame and unclear fight mechanic. Also the last boss I found easier than the first, thank god though I guess because I couldn't take much more of it really.

The throw back to chemical plant zone in sonic two was a good hit of nostalgia I guess, though I couldn't help but feel they made green hill, chemical plant zone, and then got tired of making the game, or ran out of time or something, because that was where the throw backs ended, and the content in general btw.

Controls were terrible really, and in addition to the mini games I mentioned that were irritating, I found myself constantly facing some new annoying mechanic, which once again HAD to be overcome to progress.

Despite all that, somehow, someway, in ways I will probably never truly understand, the game manages to be fun and good. 7/10 frankly enjoyed it more than GOW ragnarok and horizon forbidden west.",,

All sega has to do is build on this to make a truly great sequel but knowing them the next 3D sonic game will be nothing like this and go off in a completely different direction.",,

"First of all i did not see that coming from TeamSonic, they actually finally pulled a good sonic game from a while.

yes the game has flaws but not gamebreaking. i believe the story is okay in this game liked it but not incredible, gameplay is freaking great controls are nice, camera can be weird sometimes but easy to get used to, combat feels like DMC5 with a hedgehog = great. Areas are wide and cool to travel in but can feel empty.
challenges are baby level but that is good for one reason you do them to unlock more places in your map, something this essential should be easy to obtain. Bosses are really hype, music is jam.
biggest issue is the pop in, it is sad for a game this big to suffer from an issue this ridiculous. the draw distance can not be fixed unless by SEGA and it hurts.

Overall an 8/10",,
This game is so good my PC can't even turn it on!!!111!!,,
Sonic is back,,
Worth it for the heavy metal boss fights :33,,

"I think in terms of game mechanics, this is the best sonic game we've gotten yet. So much speedrun potential and it's been a blast to play through. However, this game is full of technical and design issues, and would have been something much better if they spent another year or two in development. Overall, this game feels like the Legend of Arceus of sonic games. Great ideas and a fun game, but could have been something so much more.",,
"I really wanted this game to be good, and it is in some aspects, but I just can't recommend this game with a clear conscience. The Sonic franchise has always struggled to find an identity from going to Camelot to being a Werehog; however, I think that it finally found its identity in this game. This is a great start to the future of Sonic games and I sincerely hope they build off of this game but in and of itself it's just an incomplete game. There's a constant reuse of textures throughout the entire game and it feels like there's a significant lack of new content the further you get into the game between the last few worlds just being different versions of the first few to recycled areas, enemies, and other various content from previous titles in the Sonic franchise and where it does provide a great feeling of nostalgia when doing so it lacks the content that a completely new game should contain; especially when the only good games of the franchise that have come out in the last decade are remasters of previously loved titles. The amount of pop-in in the game is horrendous as well and completely ruins any immersion the game provided. The graphics in it, even when playing at max, feel like your playing on a last-gen console; even in the cutscenes. It feels like the got it prepared for the switch then just ported that version over to the other consoles and pc which is absolutely unacceptable. The pace of the game is completely unbalanced as you get every skill far before you get anywhere NEAR max level. And while the boss fights are immaculate, the mechanics of them are clunky and aren't not even replayable without mods. The physics in the game are also very rough around the edges and do not feel right when trying to go up slopes or climb anything. Not to mention the camera controls can be very annoying and nauseating for some as it forces itself to move, even when you resist it, a lot throughout the game. The 2d levels all feel very recycled and are hard to even individualize after you do them all. This game is awful at worst and mediocre at best. It's just incomplete. I feel as though its getting an incredible amount of positive attention because its an interesting concept and often compared to Breath of The Wild, a very beloved title by many. Not to mention its the first not absolutely horrendous new title we've gotten out of the franchise in over a decade. This game is a great beginning for a new era of sonic but its just a skeleton. A great skeleton, but still a skeleton. This game seriously needed a delay that it did not receive. I cannot wait to see the Sonic game that follows this and here's to hoping that Sega puts in the time required to make it rather than trying to push an incomplete product out before Christmas. I do not recommend this game unless it goes on sale for $30 or less but it is certainly not worth $60. (For clarification on my 1hr of playtime I played through all of this game on Xbox and got it on PC to see it it was any better and it was not) Make sure to have a good day and that you remember to drink lots of water! Thx 4 reading friends!! <33",,
"English:They finally made a good Sonic game.Good,but not Great. It lacked polish in several areas, but i belive if they continue with this formula in future games, they can make a very promising game in the future. 7/10

"They did it... they made a GREAT sonic game. Story telling and world building is ON POINT... there is actually good lore... in a sonic game!!! Yes, they did take some obvious inspiration from BOTW (as did alot of games) but did it very well. Whoever came up with the sound track deserves an award cause it is FIRE. Control wise, it takes a bit of getting used to but once you get the hang of it, it's extremely fluid. I love that the ""skill tree"" is filled with new combat moves that are totally optional and not actually required to memorize (especially since eventually you can set the moves to automatically be used) The level design is genius and the cyber vaults (classic style levels) are a fun little challenge.

My only gripe with the game is that fishing is extremely broken and can net you all kinds of advantages for doing minimal work.",,
"Lovely game, captures the spirit of 2000's Sonic while treading new ground narratively & gameplay wise. Tons of fun exploring the open zones and tackling challenges and cyberspace missions. Epic boss fights like nothing you've ever seen, feels like its straight out of DBZ. Definitely worth your time to tweak the controls (I prefer all my settings on max) & graphics (Low settings for shadow quality & volumetric lighting + FXAA anti-aliasing gave me smooth 60fps). 10/10 would recommend to any Sonic fan or anyone fond of action adventure games/collectathon platformers.",,

"The final boss was disappointing, i expected more from it but the other main bosses is SUPER GOOD and the music is also INSANE! Sonic OST never fails.

ONE LAST THING THE FATHER DAUGHTER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EGGMAN AND SAGE IS SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ CUTE!",,
"I like a lot of flawed games.

Sonic and Kingdom Hearts are my biggest examples of that. Both these franchises are filled with games that, while well received, are very well-known and mocked for their massive flaws in each game. We all know Sonic Adventure is complete jank, painful cutscenes, and filled with way too many ideas. We all know Kingdom Hearts 3 has an awful plot with wooden dialogue and so many weird creative decisions in the gameplay that make it a bit of a mess.

So, knowing this, I have to ask myself: what is wrong with me? I like to think I'm a smart person, I know these things clearly, and I feel them too. So why is it that I can't help but love both Sonic Adventure and Kingdom Hearts 3 in spite of everything? There are critical darlings I've gotten bored of in half an hour and yet I keep coming back to these extremely flawed franchises. Is it nostalgia? I didn't play Kingdom Hearts until High School, so that can't be it.

Eventually, I came across the answer to this question through a random Youtube video by Nathan Zed named ""Vibes are Better Than Plot"". Watching this gave me a completely new perspective on what it means to ENJOY something. The video is mostly about movies rather than videogames, but I think the sentiment translates very nicely. Basically, his argument is that ""vibe"", or what would more technically be called ""atmosphere"", ""tone"", or ""the unique feeling a film gives you"", is much more important to the enjoyment of a movie than the crafting of it's plot.

Suddenly, I noticed this with everything I liked. As much as I can praise my favourite movies or favourite games for their accomplishments in story, and also gameplay in videogames case, the main thing that separated my favourites from other amazingly crafted works was the feeling they it gave me. The vibe was more important than the story or gameplay.

That all to say: Sonic Frontier's ""vibe"" is completely drab and soulless, making you feel like your humanity is being slowly sucked from you more and more with every rail you grind on, spring you homing attack, and ""puzzle"" you circle around holding the triangle button. Playing this game feels like the smell of dried grass.

I've been very against the attitude of ""gameplay over graphics"" for a while now. I get the point of it, AAA games boasting about fish AI when the actual gameplay is a repetitive slog is obviously dumb, but don't make these developers think that making something mechanically interesting is enough. Sonic controls great in this game, the best he has since Adventure 2. Just running around is fun. But the tone is a complete mess, and everything is just awful to look at. Not for the technical issues, like pop in, but this ""atmospheric landscape"" aesthetic, on top of clashing heavily with Sonic as a character, is completely smeared over with the same exact rails, springs, and floating platforms everywhere. I don't care if the story justifies it, it looks awful, as if they messed around with a Landscape tool and dumped assets everywhere.

Speaking of the story, what the hell? Why haven't they been able to recapture the thing that they captured again and again, every single time, in every game before Colours? Just make it a stupid shonen-esque plot, it's not that hard. Make it fun with confidence. Sonic Team made the mistake of going in this terrible self-aware meta direction Colours to Lost World that nobody liked, and now everyone in this game sounds like they're a sentence away from crying. It's a blue hedgehog guys, it's not that serious.

Anyways, point is: Sonic has lost it's charm, which was the one thing that made the games fun despite all of their problems. I'll probably still be a sucker in another 5 years for the next screw up, but I definitely won't be excited.",,

"Extremely low bar but best 3D Sonic game since Generations (12 years ago woof lol). Its actually playable and fun unlike say, Sonic Colors.

Soundtrack was a highlight. Game kinda just ends and i didn't really understand the story all the much. But the game was really fun to play and just run around the ""open zones"". Cyberspace levels were eh, wasn't a fan. Definitely worth checking out",,
"Product received for free

mind-numbingly same-y. The story and presentation is better than previous games in the series, but the incredibly monotonous gameplay is just too little action to handle for more than a few hours. the only motivation to continue brainlessly collecting hundreds of little doodads is my mental illness being dissatisfied with something still being left on the map. And even then, you can just cyloop to get everything. or fish. or cook meat. good lord, I'd rather play 06. at least it was a game.",,
"i have just 100%'d the achievements for the game last night. the day after Another Story came out. i also did the 100% completion of the game to top it off. to anyone playing through the game, i HIGHLY recommend that you play on easy when playing through the game UNTIL THE LAST BOSS. you will not get the ""true"" ending. you will miss out on fighting the real final boss and it is worth it. you can go through the whole game on easy which makes the Action Challenges much more manageable. (do these as you go through each island trust me the reward is worth it.)

my ONE and ONLY grip with the game is that the reward for 100%ing the game vs S ranking all of the action challenges is night and day. you dont need to 100% it. not worth it. BUT S ranking all of the action challenges made 100%ing way more fun.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is the best Sonic game we've had since Sonic Generations. That's saying quite a bit, since while occasionally drab, Generations was the cleanest performing Sonic game we'd get until this one. That took 11 years.

Regardless.

Sonic Frontiers offers the best characterization the story has ever had to offer by a country mile. The voice acting is subdued but very real, the characters behave the ways we'd always wanted them to and imagined they could.

What's crazier, everything is canon. From Boom, to Shadow, to Unleashed, everything except maybe Sonic 06 is acknowledged. Chiefly acknowledged as having happened as a core element is Sonic Adventure. There's a lot of REALLY fascinating story beats.

If you want to play for a great Sonic story, this is the game for you.

The soundtrack is also incredible. You've probably already heard, ""Undefeatable"". If you haven't, go look it up (or wait until you play!) Lots of really experimental stuff, chiefly in the cyber stages.

But you're here for a Game review right?

The open world is lovingly crafted and well made. The enemies are fun, though mashy to fight. The world is gorgeous, and while you can say it's strange to see this cartoonish blue hedgehog juxtaposed against a borderline photorealistic world, that's been the formula for a long time. That's just Sonic, and it's kind of hilarious in its own way.

Combat is fairly tight. Not quite DMC, not quite Bayonetta, but I heard it jokingly referred to as, ""The Metal Gear Rising sequel we were all waiting for"" and, yeah. That's not far off given the attitude and feel. Personal advice - if you want a challenge, don't upgrade your damage and health. The game will last longer and you'll get the challenge you want. If you want a power trip, go crazy.

Exploration is good and every time you finish a puzzle, the world naturally links you from the previous puzzle in order you'd completed. So say you finish Mission 01 and Mission 02 - there will be a Grind rail between them now. What's more, you can basically create a circuit around the world as you explore it doing this. So you end up with this network of high speed rails that let you really pull in the vistas. It's quite remarkable.

The miniboss and boss fights are also stellar, it's extremely cool to go through them all. They are just straight up fun. Mildly frustrating at times, but it gets like that in most games anyway.

I will warn you, the camera can behave very strangely at times. If you want to homing attack at something, it HAS to be in the camera view - you can't treat it like Sonic Adventure, where if you know it's there you can just gun it, you need to be able to see it too. Oh, speaking of which...

Homing attack is separate from jumps - which can be done twice now, double jumps return from Forces. Homing attacks are strictly attacks/homing tools for individual marked targets. You can do it from the ground and it is a LOVELY feeling. I want them to keep this.

Boost is no longer an attack. You CAN use it in conjucntion with Cyloop to make it one, but the era of rushing into foes to eliminate them is gone - and I am very glad that power trip is in the rear view mirror. I never liked it, personally.

Sonic has an attack now, it's very similar to how Shadow played in his game and 06, but it gets less bad as time goes on. You can dodge when an enemy blocks to whip around them and slap them around from the back, you can parry and open them up for an assault (parry is just held down, it is not timing dependent. Likely an accessibility consideration.) It's very neat. I like watching classic video game characters become more kinetic as time goes on - I felt the same when Metroid Dread came out. (I'm interesting to see how the next Smash Bros. game adapts these two as a result. IF they do... A gripe for another day.)

But this game does have trouble.

Cyberspace.

A good friend of mine swears by cyberspace stages, but they have entirely different rules from the open world. You move more slowly, boost feels ponderous, you can only boost once in the air (and it gives upwards momentum + it only resets once Sonic's feet touch the ground. REALLY internalize that.) - you also turn horribly. I did not ever feel in full control of Sonic during cyberspace, and some levels have unique mechanics, so you'll pretty often be rather confused about what you're supposed to do. I encountered... Maybe four stages our of thirty that I enjoyed.

Cyberspace doesn't do anything for the story by the way. Like, if you want to progress without interacting with them at all, you absolutely can. I'm just a completionist - you can see in my profile, I've 100%'d this game. About all that can get me to play again is a challenge run of Hard Mode (Which, by the way, has the true ending - yes, a Sonic game with a true and VERY IMPORTANT ending!) and, I don't know. If someone drops a really high quality Sash Lilac mod. Because I adore Freedom Planet.

Oh, Big's fishing minigame is a fun distraction too by the way.

Sonic Frontiers is the end of the prior era and the beginning of a new one. This game is succeeding and doing well. It HAS problems - like how on Island 3, most challenges are forced 2D in an open world setting, and the worst pinball minigame of the whole friggin' franchise purely because of its score requirement (500,000? Are you serious?). The next game we see will definitely take after Frontiers. I'm excited to see that!

But it has troubles to iron out.

I recommend this game, it's very good. It's also, while occasionally janky, not verybuggy! There IS a distinct difference!

My only hopes are that we can ditch this whole forced 2D thing eventually. Classic Sonic fans are insanely privileged in that they got an entire throwback game, and every single 3D game since Unleashed has had mandatory 2D sections that the entire community has *always* been torn on. I think it's time fans of Adventure styles of play actually got what they've been waiting 20 years for and not have to acknowledge classic fans. Because comparatively, they've been left in the dust for way, way too long.

So go crazy! I give Sonic Frontiers a solid 8/10. I truly do mean that it is an excellent game and by far the best Sonic game we've had since Generations.",,

Pay no mind to those few negative reviews (those are just people that forgot how to just enjoy games, or are probably just bad at Sonic games in general. Haha)

I'm still plan on going back in and finishing all of the achievement. Looking forward to maybe finding little Easter eggs along the way possibly and just exploring the islands. I hope Sega continues to improve on this type of game for Sonic in the future.",,

Sonic Frontiers marks a new era of Sonic the Hedgehog, one far away from the influences of Yuji Naka and far away from the crunch culture that permeated the Sonic Team. Things looked dicey for this game when the early footage released for this game was unappetizing. Needless to say, this game proved everyone wrong. Sonic is better than ever in what is ostensibly his best adventure yet.

Most of your time in Sonic Frontiers is spent exploring mysterious islands. As you make way, you'll fine platforming tasks to attempt, puzzles to solve, and foes to overcome. It's a simple system that works very effectively, backed up with the best mechanics the Blue Blur has ever experienced. The jumping has been refined and heavily improved upon, with an addition of combat capabilities to conquer the wide list of creative enemies in the game. There's so much to do in the game and it feeds it into a satisfying sense of completion. The introduction to the game can be a little rough at first especially when you're still getting acclimated to the mechanics of the game and without having everything properly explained to you, but once you've gotten used to the game, it hooks you hard. The combat can be a bit easy to pull off especially when there's zero precise timing required to pull off your parries, but it is fun and spectacular to watch, without it ever taking control away from the player.

When you're not exploring the island, you're doing linear levels similar to the ones from the boost era of Sonic (Colors, Generations, Forces). The levels are all well-varied and are generally a ton of fun to play. There are also challenges to do that aren't too difficult to beat, and if you miss anything, the levels are short enough that redoing isn't a big deal at all. My only complaint about them however is that the 2D levels do feel a little slow and aren't as responsive to control in as with the 3D levels. There is a solid amount of levels in the game, and given how packed just exploring the island is, this game feels immensely feature-rich. Whenever you need to wind down, there's a simple fishing mini-game that can also help ease off some of the exploration and grinding should you wish to overpower your character or move the game along by getting plot-focused collectibles early.

This game is just oozing with charm, from its incredible music by Tomoya Ohtani, to its writing by Ian Flynn and both of their respective teams. The game takes the previous entries' plots into account and has characters behaving and conversing based on past events, with some genuinely fun writing that takes itself seriously and is never satirical as with the state of the Blue Blur prior to the release of this game. It's so refreshing seeing Sonic feel confident about attempting some serious story-telling again. As for the music, whenever you're not listening to the whimsical open world music, you're banging it to the amazing techno beats, and even more shocking is some of the downright metal tracks for some certain key moments.

As far as for this games' downsides, most of it is minor and nitpicky. I mentioned how the 2D stages are slow as well as how the game feels a bit rough early on especially when you haven't yet unlocked that many things to do. The checkpointing in this game can be rough at times where it sends you back to your latest stage if you die to an enemy in the open world, and with certain boss fights, robs you of all of your rings should you fail an attempt at them, making subsequent attempts all that much harder to do, especially given how you're locked off from leaving and collecting more rings to have a better shot at them. There is one mini-game that's fun at first but can get super annoying especially given how long it drags on. There are some jarring pop-in issues that make exploration more difficult and the camera can get a little wonky at times.

In the end, Sonic Frontiers is an excellent Sonic game and a fantastic open world experience. It's definitely something that's worth your time and money, especially if you are a Sonic fan. With this game, Spark the Electric Jester 3, and Freedom Planet 2, Sonic fans are eating really good this year.",,

"Please add photo mode to future games, pairing this with reshade and the mod manager's restriction removal codes feels unreal... And oh my god, let us buy the deluxe versions of your new games separately, SEGA. I don't want to have to pay an additional $70 to buy your game again with the deluxe version just to get the artbook.

If you're going to buy this game, get it on sale as it's absolutely not worth full price, and you will probably need to use it with mods.[gamebanana.com]It will greatly improve the experience, even if you're just using some codes in the manager to get rid of some of those really questionable decisions thought up by the developers. Who was the brainiac up at SEGA thinking that your camera should lock onto Sonic with every single ability he uses? Or maybe that accidentally stepping on any dash pad in Chaos Island should lock you into a 2 minute long 2d segment with automated moves and invisible walls that prevent you from getting back down?

If you aren't already a fan of Sonic and looking to drop $60 on a game, you should absolutely avoid this one and buy something else, this franchise is only for the 'tistic!",,
"Best Sonic since Adventure 2. Easily. It feels like the Sonic Team that is convinced they're making the coolest ♥♥♥♥ ever has returned.

No spoilers here.

To quickly put it in perspective, about 16 hours in, I ran into a section in a level that made me wait for a platform, and impatiently waiting for mere seconds made me realize how actively engaged I am the other 99% of the time. The game really knows its strengths, and wants you to just get out there and go for it. Where previous Sonic games have had a tendency to fall into being overly automated, this one has figured out how to give you a spectacle that you earn, by filling maps chock full with rails, springs, boost pads, wall runs, and so on, all of which require your responsiveness. The platforming in this game is FAST. The best cameras in video games are ones you don't notice, and I will say Frontiers' camera is generally phenomenal. It knows where the action is, and you always have plenty of time to react to what's coming, so you don't need to fiddle with the cameras or stop moving. The game really does not care HOW you progress, and will give you items you need as long as you just keep zipping around the islands. And if you feel exhausted with all that, the fishing minigame allows you to take a breather and still progress that way. When I said the game doesn't care how you progress, I mean it. Sonic Team made a great open world and wanted the players to have the freedom to smash into whatever enemies and run or jump up, down, across, or into whatever they want. And if you keep playing and keep upgrading your stats, you just get faster, and faster, and faster. Top speed in this game feels hilariously fast and rewarding. Easily the most fun I've had playing a game in years.

The game is so addicting, I have been completely and blissfully ignoring the flaws in the presentation of the game. Yet, I would feel dishonest if I didn't write them in this review. To list them, and why I didn't find them to be deal breakers:

- Pop-in is very-much present, remarks on this front are genuine. However, you're going to be racing around from point A to point B so much, you'll hardly notice it since you'll be weaving around obstacles and reacting to what's directly in front of you a very good portion of the time.

- Cyberspace levels do not control 1:1 with how the controls in the open world do. The levels even seem to control slightly different from one another. This is a bizarre choice, perhaps ties into other design motifs in the game, but this issue is generally not as jarring as you might expect unless you're trying to make a particularly tricky jump.

- Excessive re-use of cutscenes. Every time you enter a portal, leave a portal, fast travel to a portal, activate a story segment, collect a chaos emerald, a small cutscene will play. This is the nitpickiest of nitpicks, since you're able to skip these cutscenes, but they are definitely repetitive, and only feel worse than they are due to how fast the game is the rest of the time.

- Cyberspace levels only have 4 themes. This is a big disappointment for some folks, especially given there are a good handful of levels per island, meaning you'll be looking at the same backdrops from the start to the end of the game. And, they are themes that Sonic Team has been reusing repeatedly for about a decade now. However the levels are generally really well-designed, and the joy in them comes from their bite-sized length that makes it fun to try and blitz through as fast as possible to make the S rank time. Their memorability suffers from the fact that they all share themes, and they don't have names.

At the time, these are the main issues I have with the game. All I can say at this point is that I'm extremely excited for Sonic's future titles, and feel that if SEGA is ready to commit to giving Sonic Team more freedom over what they make (considering development time, budget, resources), we may be at the doorstep of another golden age for Sonic.",,

-HORRENDOUS pop-in even on the highest graphics settings
-Slow and sluggish cyber space levels, as the physics from the overworld do NOT carry into cyberspace

Overall a clearly higher budget Sonic game compared to recent years, an amazing change from the ""boost"" formula, with a story that respects long time fans like me. In the next game, be it Sonic Frontiers 2 or just a new title in this style all I ask for more than anything is better physics, and more ""Sonic"" level design. Loops, corkscrews, hills, ramps, wallrunning etc.",,
"It's got a lot of rough edges, and I mean a LOT, but overall I wouldn't say I regret spending this much time finishing it and completing the entire game all the way through.

Sonic controls great, the characters are good (new and old), the music is great as always, and anytime you're Super Sonic against the bosses it's easily my favorite and most memorable moments throughout the game. My lowest point though would be anytime your doing the """"""""""puzzles"""""""""" throughout the zones.

I would place it up there with the good Sonic games but just under my favorites. If you have the chance, definitely get this game if it's on sale, but even if it isn't I wouldn't say it would be a regretful purchase.",,
"Easily my favorite Sonic game! Zooming around a moody island getting into anime-fights with robots and parkouring through obstacle courses is crazy fun! Oh, and the soundtrack rules!",,
Its not a revolutionary game however it has good graphics and if your someone who's willing to grind then you'll love it.,,
"Rough around the edges, but it clearly has a big heart.",,
one of the best sonic games out there,,
"All the References From Sonic Adventure 1, Sonic Adventure 2, Sonic 06 and others. After all these years. This really was a True Sonic Fan Love Letter for those who grew up with Sega back in the Genesis and Dreamcast Dyas. They brought back its roots just like in Sonic Adventure 1. They just need to tweak the settings a bit for widescreen but playing this on 8K resolution is Absolutely Gorgeous.",,
"Great character and environment art and storytelling. I enjoyed randomly venturing around the island, as there were many interesting platforming and combat events dispersed around the island. It was also fun upgrading Sonic's abilities through the skill tree. Overall one of the better Sonic games I've played in a very long time.",,
"The mechanics and main gameplay loop are satisfying, and the jank varies from useful to funny in three dimensions.
Unfortunately, the game loves to move to a two dimensional camera all the time, for no discernable reason, limiting both freedom and speed when you really just wanted to get to point B already.

Progression is great when you're left to your devices, but once you finally get the hang of it, they lock parts of areas out for story reasons, preventing hitting 100% exploration until you do a bunch of random tasks you may not be intending to do when *exploring*.
Insultingly, the cutscenes for progression can include doing things you may well have tried and hit an invisible wall for daring attempt, just... arbitrarily successfully.

It was worth the experience personally, but I can only recommend it if you're the kind of masochist who can push through this much ????. You know who you are.",,
"Two enthusiastic thumbs way up! this game is stellar! Not since Sonic 2 have I truly been impressed by a Sonic game but this delivers on all fronts. The game play is tight, super fast and just gets better the more you play. This is a strong recommend for anyone.",,
"I took a gamble preordering a Sonic game in 2022, but I must say I wasn't disappointed. This game has ups and downs, but I overall loved it and as a life long Sonic fan it makes me happy that frontiers is mostly well received. The titan boss fights go crazy.",,
"Absolutely incredible Sonic game. A huge step-up from Sonic Forces. Movement is amazing, so much to explore in the worlds that it'll never leave you bored, and the soundtrack is incredible. Not the perfect Sonic game since it does have some bugs and issues, but it's almost perfect. Absolutely nailed this game. 9.5/10",,
"the gameplay is pretty good, and the story is fine. all and all i would recommend checking it out. maybe wait for a sale idk?",,

"Super fun, first super good sonic game other than Mania in a while. A step in the right direction, thank goodness :D",,
"To quote agent stone:

""HE""S BACK!!!""",,
Best sonic game in years. There is a ton of lore and references to almost every game in the series. The game has some performance issues but still really fun. Just going around the open world on all rails and open world platforming is really fun. The island bosses are not challenging fights but they are done really well especially when you enter reaction input sequences.,,
"If Sonic The Hedgehog thinks, I agree.

If Sonic The Hedgehog speaks, I listen.

If Sonic The Hedgehog orders, I obey.

If Sonic The Hedgehog has a million fans, I am one of them.

If Sonic The Hedgehog has one fan, I am that fan

If Sonic The Hedgehog has 0 fans , I’m dead",,
"i loved the game which i was very sceptical at first and the music in this game i have never felt so energised with the music when playing sonic before. unless its sonic adventure 2. All the boss fights in worlds 1-3 were absolutely fantastic and the music for them was top notch, took me by surprise in a very good way.

But unfortunately my biggest problem with the game was the last boss. i wont say much about it but it was very underwhelming and took away from the whole experience in my honest opinion.

All the cyberspace levels were amazing and i will forever love 4-1 cyberspace. that dubstep song goes hard and i am equally just as hard for the song.

I did beat the game on hard speed mode and honestly it was very simple i cant imagine what the lower difficulties are like but hard mode is not hard at all it felt like a normal to most games.",,
"Don’t stop me now!!!!
Story amazing! Best things about it….?
Corny sonic dialogue.
Go fast!
Sonic meets Horizon? Lol Jknotjk
Best sonic game in a VERY long time. Well done devs/Sega!",,
Best Sonic Game ever made. Sonic is now as bad a** as a DBZ character.,,
i am happy this was actually fun !,,
"This new music collection by Tomoya Ohtani is really amazing, though it seems like it came attached with some kind of game about a funny looking blue rat thing, which is alright too I guess",,
"Good game, Sonic go fast, gotta go fast, speed speed boom",,
best game sonic game so far and a great game to look for collectibles and explore,,
pretty fun game,,
"Easily the best sonic game in decades. The open zone design and all of the overworld puzzles make for a fun adventure, and the story is more engaging than I've experienced in a sonic game maybe ever.",,
i love this game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥,,
"We finally have a good Sonic game. Occasionally janky but really fun to play nontheless. Has great dialogue, AWESOME music and pretty good combat with some moments that would fit into a Metal Gear Rising Revengance. The game is not perfect but i can look past the bad things like pop in and have fun. A must play for any fan of the franchise.",,
it's real sonic,,
"Amzing step in the right directionn for a Sonic game. Loved every bit of it, though, cyberspace stages are the weakest part of the game.",,
Great game an a solid view to the franchise,,
"game just crashed out of nowhere afther latest update, cant be ´played in ultra wide even if the resolution setting allows ultra wide screens",,
"Product received for free

it actually has garfield in it",,
"If you are a fan of sonic you will absolutely love sonic frontiers. The best sonic story since unleashed, some of the smoothest 3d gameplay since generations, and the exact kind of quality you would expect out of a sonic soundtrack. The open world is a blast to run around in, but the cyberspace levels left a bit to be desired. The combat was simple but a ton of fun. A little bit of jank is present and can get annoying at times, but if you can look past it this game will be an amazing time for any sonic fan. Very excited to see what sonic team can do to build on this game in the future.",,
"If you liked Sonic Generations or Unleashed, this will be a warm welcome back for you. While it has a few low points, its highs are higher than they've ever been in a Sonic game. An overall engaging experience, if a little scuffed in a few places.

They at long last hired a guy to make tight controls for Sonic. If that doesn't sell you, I don't know what will",,
"Sonic is back and oh my god what a fun game. Most fun I've had controlling Sonic since Adventure 2. Great writing. Cyberspace a bit janky, but it isn't a Sonic game with a side mode that barely works and even there it's still fun. Would absolutely recommend, and I had low expectations for this game given Sonic Team's recent track record.",,
"Genuinely don't understand how this remotely has as high of a rating as it does to be honest. Just feels empty, difficult to control, and lacking personality that the series deserves. I can even look past all of that, but I've not gotten any good performance running the game and other technical stuff like terrible pop-in ruins the game for me.

Coming back after some updates. This game needs it.",,

this game is like a 7\10 but i will be nice and will give sonic team a hesinberg out of 10 for making a good game.",,
"The game certainly has ups and downs, but the overall experience is enjoyable",,
Fun to 100%,,
"Gonna keep it short and simple. I didn't have any technical issues or odd situations with this game. This is one of the best 3D Sonic games to me, and when the necessary improvements are made next time (hopefully), it'll be a thoroughly amazing experience. Only major criticisms I have is for scenes near the end to not be as abrupt, make Sonic more maneuverable in Cyber Space, add more variety into Cyber Space, and improve pop-in. 8/10.

Positives: Open Zone movement and level flow (besides Chaos Island), soundtrack, writing, late-game Cyber Space levels, Boss spectacle.

Update 3 Edit: Final Horizon just took everything good about the game and made it better, as well as improved in some areas. By far the best content the game has to offer. Final score after all updates is 9/10 for me.",,
"GO FAS

Game's enjoyable. Don't expect anything deep. The character conversations are okay, the combat is okay, the enemies are okay. There's a lot of ""well, it's not bad"" going on. After Forces, Sonic Team needed a win, and I do believe they found one. This direction for Sonic is fantastic, even if it's more or less following Sonic Lost World in the vein of ""just do it like a good Nintendo game did"". It worked this time around.

The downsides:
A bit of repetitive stuff and some absolutely hilarious texture pop. It doesn't make the game any less fun for me, but it is certainly immersion breaking. FPS is limited to 60. Also, Denuvo for some piss soaked reason.

If you're not a big Sonic fan, wait a little bit for a sale.
If you're a big Sonic fan? Gogogogogo.",,
Great sonic game since SA2 can't wait for what the future of Sonic games will bring this is a step in the right direction.,,
Game is still a bit buggy but it is an amazing sonic game,,
Its way past cool,,
sonic runs and then he wins,,
"Honestly, after the pain of Forces and the long wait... after the weak marketing at the start and the rising expectations...
Game good!
I'm absolutely loving the game so far. There's some polish that it could really use, but the gameplay is really fun, and feels wonderful. Climactic moments are incredible, the bosses are so exciting, the game is good. Just wish some things were cleaned up a bit.

It was worth the 5 year wait, but it would've been worth a couple more months of polish as well.",,
"Product received for free

FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLAY THIS GAME! I just finished the first island, 100% of it, and fought the first major boss. This is the first time in over a decade that I've fully submerged myself into a sonic game and I'm loving every bit of it. The story is something we haven't seen in a sonic game be this serious in such a long time, the characters actually have character! (no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ way) and the voice acting is actually pretty damn good. Gameplay wise this is nothing short of a blast to play. If you're a fan of the 3D sonic games such as Generations, Unleashed, and Colors, this game takes the good and makes it better. I won't go into spoiler territory but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game has the best soundtrack that I've ever heard from a game in years! if you like Devil May Cry, Metal Gear Rising or any other game that pumps out thunderous metal tracks while you fight then this is the game for you. The open world is massive yet not overwhelming at the same time, giving players an easy time figuring out the layout of the map while giving you plenty of room to boost around and practice your free running. Hunting down items never feels tedious but instead feels innovative and clever, having to figure out how to get from point A to point B in the most efficient way possible to collect all the little trinkets and doo-dads that are sprinkled around the map. The combat feels fluid and fun to control, however not perfect. I've experienced a couple little bugs but it's honestly not a big deal in the grand scheme of things. So yeah, if you're a bit on the fence with this game and weren't 100% sure if you wanted to commit, I so strongly recommend this game especially if you're a Sonic fan (AHEM and a fan of Metal tracks in your video games) Sonic is back!!!",,
"If you prefer using a mouse for camera control over a stick, then stay away from this game. This game has negative mouse acceleration, which causes the game to handle the mouse like a joystick, which greatly limits the speed and precision of the mouse controls and makes it feel absolutely terrible to play. Very few other PC game releases these days have this problem, and it's an indictment of how much keyboard and mouse controls were an afterthought with this port, and in some ways, it's bad programming.

Which sucks, because this game should in theory be amazing with competently implemented keyboard and mouse controls (or hybrid controls like the Steam Controller/Steam Deck with the right touchpad, mouse with a split controller or just a controller in the left hand, etc.), with the mouse enabling quick and precise turning at high speeds, among other things, but I'm leaving this negative review in protest of the shoddy implementation of KBM controls. I really hope this gets fixed or someone mods in a fix.",,
"Overall the gameplay is solid, the story is great although the ending a bit anti-climactic. I love the references and change of writing in this game. This is how the story for sonic games should be written. Gameplay I can fee was experimental but really good in end. Bosses are the highlight, and excellent sound track. All that said SEGA has completely forgotten why the boost formula worked the way it did. Cyberspace was what I had the worst time with, stiff, janky, no sense of speed unless you hit a dash pad. There were a few levels I really enjoyed that I played over more than once but that's no excuse. SEGA has worsened the boost formula ever after Sonic Generations, even forces boost levels are superior. Needs more post game content and hopefully we get that from the DLC roadmap. But for now its an 8/10 for me. I loved it overall and would recommend everyone gives it a try. The blue blur is back!",,
"I have wanted this game since it was announced. I wanted to love this game. I was so excited to finally get it and enjoy another Sonic story... But 28 minutes in and I've requested a refund. The controls are ridiculous, The menu interaction is annoying, the DLC is obnoxious, and 5 seconds after a tutorial screen has interrupted game play (That I just desperately wanted to get back to) and I've already forgotten what it wanted me to do. It's just uninteresting and WAY too forgettable. The first skill in the game wants you to run in a circle... with arrow keys...
Again, I DESPERATELY wanted to love this game. But I just can't. A very small part of me wonders if I'm being too critical but at this point I'm too disappointed to care.",,

then i finally got the game and it's really not that great. It's not bad but it's not the Sonic I grew up with. It might be a lot of fun to a fresh generation of people but I think sonic died with Adventure 2.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is an incredible way to continue the Sonic Franchise, from fun gameplay, to answering questions about where two very important pieces of the franchise's lore came from, and even actually having a good story, which is usually quite rare in the 3D games. [Sonic Adventure 1 & 2 excluded.] This great story is partially thanks to the one of the writers being Ian Flynn, a writer for the Archie Comics and the IDW Comics. I genuinely have enjoyed every second of the game that I've played so far, and I'm excited to see Sonic Team continue to learn from every piece of feedback gained from this game. If you DO decide to buy this game, don't look up any walkthroughs. Figure the story out yourself, enjoy the game without outside interference. I highly recommend SONIC: FRONTIERS to any long-time fan of the franchise, or any new ones checking it out.",,
"I'm just 3 hours in but I can say for sure that this is one of the best sonic games ever made IMO.

Please don't listen to all the critics' reviews and play this game with your own hands because it's worth it.

Gonna update my review every once in a while.

EDIT 1: I found some minor bugs and the physics of the game are kind of janky at times. Pop-ins are not THAT annoying, but they could be fixed. Other than these things, the game is still really good.

EDIT 2: finished the game today. I still think it's one of the best sonic games. The ending could have been developed a little bit more but not going to say anything else in order to avoid spoilers. The music is amazing. Gameplay too. SONIC IS OFFICIALLY BACK.",,

After beating the first island, the story so far is really good, much better than most recent games *cough forces* and the ""open zones"" are very fun to run around in! if you're looking for a fresh sonic experience with new gameplay that isn't just running down hallways, this is the game for you!",,

"game goes hard, feel free to buy",,
"Hey Sonic, do you wanna try? I'll let you borrow a rod!

I love this game",,
I can't believe how fun it is! A worthy opponent to BOTW and Odyssey,,
"I remember playing Sonic Generations and how I considered it the best, and that the boost formula was the coolest mechanic, I was so hyped for Sonic Forces as well because that was supposed to be the successor to Sonic Generations but we all know the story... it sucked as hell, and it shattered my hope in the franchise forever because of the cheesy dialogue that has been in an excuse of a plot since Sonic Colors came out.
Since then we wouldn't get a new Sonic game for the next half a decade, Sonic kind of because obscure as a gaming icon and it saddened me really because I love this franchise. That was until the movies came out and renewed Sonic's image in the general public's eye, and with the big setback that is Sonic Origins people rightfully thought that Sonic is no longer good in gaming but should be in other media like movies and TV shows. The marketing campaign of Sonic Frontiers did not help either, they showed a shallow few months early build of the game that looked boring. I kept expectations so fu*king low, like ''Great another failed attempt by Sega to make a game''.
But for the surprise of all of us, this game absolutely shatters expectations, and it is an absolute banger of a game! what a refreshing way to experience the franchise again without bad cheesy dialogue and ''boost to win'' style gameplay.
The passion by the devs is felt in this game, this is one of the funnest games I've played this year, and I just can't help but thank Sonic Team for bringing such an amazing idea of an Open World Sonic game to life, this is an experimental game and it could actually bring so much more to the future of Sonic!
Like new open world Sonic games that build upon what's created in Sonic Frontiers.
And also you must keep Ian Flyn as the writer for Sonic at all costs Sega, Sonic and his pals have never felt like themselves in years, and he managed to remind people of the real personality of each character masterfully. And also those Boss fights... Holy sh*t... my dream of a Sonic game has actually come true!

And the soundtrack, it must be the best soundtrack that released in 2022 no question!
The peaceful music to the fast paced synthwave and a hint of dubstep too! and on top all of that every boss has insane heavy metal vocals that just blow me away!

This MUSIC SLAPS!!! Tomoya Ohtani has to stay too Sega!

This game rocks! and I can't wait to see what the future holds for this new genre of Sonic.",,
"a very fun sonic game! this is a step for the franchise in a super good direction. the controls feels super smooth and well thought out and there is very little bad about the game. there are a couple of things not so great about it though mostly the lock on sometimes tracks the wrong object or enemy. camera can sometimes freak out a bit when you are trying to platform underneath certain enemies most notably the first boss. Rest assured the good far out weigh the bad. there is so much to do and explore, all in all it is a fun time. for me especially, I haven't enjoyed a sonic 3D game since adventure 2 this was amazing and I cannot wait to see the future of the franchise if this is but a taste of things to come. 8/10 game from me",,
Look up Amy r34 for island 1 speedrunning methods,,
"i know it's a low bar thanks to the likes of sonic forces
but this is legitimately the best sonic game we've gotten in a *long* time

it's not perfect by any stretch
there's some glitches (what do you expect, it's a sonic game), the overworld is a bit rough around the edges which i cant really fault since it's their first time trying something like this, it runs pretty poorly on steam deck (it works! but there's a ton of flickering), and i was a bit iffy on the combat at first

but the movement feels *great,* the open world suits sonic really well, and the combat grew on me eventually, the cyberspace levels are (shockingly) more than just a straight line and overall it's just really fun to play i love it so much

edit: 11/20
so i beat the game a few days ago and...my opinion still stands! this is my personal game of the year despite its flaws. also it seems to run better on steam deck now! or maybe i finally found the right options, idk lol

third island sucks tho",,
"I have been waiting for this game to go on sale. Now that I have it, I wonder what I was thinking. I am a 72 year old neophyte gamer and have no experience with this game's legacy. I have now acquired 2.5 hours of play time that felt like 30 minutes. I am on EASY mode and slow as possible and I still have no idea what I am doing, but found my self mesmerized by the graphics, the game pace, the music, and the complexity. I'm supposed to remember all these finger/thumb movements?
Yes, I am impressed and right now I am about waste another 30 minutes (2.5 hours).",,

Awesome game so far. But the pop ins are obnoxiously bad. I'm not talking about stuff that's even far away. Stuff pops in that's like 5 feet away lol. This is unacceptable in 2022. Your telling me a big open world game like Elden Ring has no pop ins & a low graphic game like Sonic can't do it lol. Sega surprised me in making a fun Sonic game. And Sega doesn't have a good track record in fixing there games in the past so I might refund this game... cause yes the pops in are really really bad. So bad I can say I never seen it happen this bad in a game. But wouldn't that say something if Sega listen to us & fixed the pop in problem. Wow that would change negative opinions about this company. And could change there imagine. But I'm not holding my breath. Otherwise the game is a lot of fun. But all that work is just ruined by this problem,,
"Not for me. Played for little over an hour and everything just felt off. After playing hundreds of polished games over the years, something about this one just felt off. I legitimately tried to get into it, but it just felt so amateur and thrown together that I didn't want to commit any more time to it. I think it has really good ideas and I like how they handled the movement in the sense that you don't have to worry about momentum all the time. But I would rather have the game have more polished areas like Mario Galaxy with fewer, but more interesting and focused objectives. I'm sure people who are dying to like another Sonic game may still be able to swallow the pill, but I just played it as a game regardless of the franchise. If I wanted a more 'Sonic' style game, I'd want them to do something similar to the approach of the latest Mega Man.",,
"I just...can't recommend this right now. The game is somewhat entertaining, but feels soul-less with really poor design choices. The combat feels incredibly cheesy, and the landscape feels cobbled together. The skills feel relatively pointless; mashing one button tends to get most of the work done you need. Anything else that you do is purely for style or to switch it up. I feel no incentive to level up beyond just because I bump into the guys that help you do so. The puzzles (specifically the map puzzles) are just plain bad. Nothing challenging about them, nothing to think about. They're just chores you need to do.

There are some pros. Running around feels really good. There's typically enough space between things that you can really feel like you're playing a sonic game; you're able to get up to speed. The platform puzzles, while not feeling well integrated, control relatively well. There's some jank, and often times you feel penalized for trying to go through them fast. You'll feel this when you have too much momentum when switching rails and just straight up jump off the puzzle. But overall they feel good. The bosses tend to have some fun mechanics but SOMETIMES they don't work well.

I'd probably give this game a 5/10. It's entertaining, I'll play it. But I wish I bought it on sale.",,
"A big improvement over prior Sonic games in terms of stability but Sonic Team just does not seem to know how to make a game.

TL:DR - If you're on the fence, wait for a sale. Maybe some improvements to improve the flow of the game will come out by then. Only get this now if you're a fan of the post-Adventure games because you will be very impressed.

I just requested a refund for the game and may not get it because my play time was 67 minutes. That's because I spent almost 15min trying to figure out how to open the menu to just quit the game. I opted to alt+f4 in the end but it turned out it was because I was in a conversation, which for some reason blocks you from opening the menu, and that the menu button on keyboard is P, not ESC like any sane game.

Gameplay-wise it has the sidescrolling 1-2min levels of classic Sonic games or 3d/2.5d interspersed with a Breath of the Wild/Elden Ring esque open world with large monsters and lots of exploration. I think it would be a lot of fun, even if you're not a Sonic fan, if only the design decisions of constantly interrupting the game with loading screens, help and tutorial pop-ups, short cut-scenes to show you ran into an enemy, or chatting with a character were not 90% of the ""gameplay"" experience. Almost all of these could have been handled with a short pop-up in the corner or at the center of the screen and not require taking away control from the player.

The actual gameplay is pretty fun otherwise. 3d platforming, going fast, time trial levels, new action-oriented Sonic with skill-trees and statistics to grow, there is a game here that wants to be played! Most of your favorite Sonic characters are here too and they look great! Not some ""modernized"" redesign, but the characters as they should be. Even Biggs the Cat made it in! Voice choices for the hero's is questionable though. I've only heard Amy, Tails, and Sonic but Sonic sounds like he should be the voice of Knuckles. Maybe you'll enjoy them though.

It's a game I want to enjoy but I can't. Maybe there are options to turn off a bunch of the pop-ups but I'm not willing to fight against the frustrating design choices to force myself to like the game.",,
"I've been playing Sonic since I was a small child. Sonic 1 for the Genesis is the first game I remember playing. Played pretty much all but the game gear ones up until the Wii. Secret Rings, Black Knight, and Unleashed really left a bad taste in my mouth. Never played Colors or Forces. I've always been able to go back to 1,2,3&K and have a good time. I've played through Mania at least a dozen times since it came out. I however as an adult capable of taking off the nostalgia glasses, realize that even Adventure 1 and 2 had it's fair share of bugs and frustrations.

This game is a step in the right direction for 3D sonic, he feels fun to control in the Overworld. A touch slow unless you're boosting, but fun none the less. The two big issues for me are the game progression, and bugs.

The problem I have with the progression is it's a McGuffin hunt, Every aspect of the game is centered on gathering a thing and using it somewhere else. Enemies drop a thing that powers you up. Collect little stone dudes to take to what I was told was a bigger stone dude via one of the many tutorial text boxes that constantly bring your gameplay to a stop. Beat missions in cyberspace substages to get another thing to unlock a thing. It feels like I'm running in circles.

As far as bugs go, it's leagues better then older entries in the era of modern Sonic, however I don't have these issues with the 2D games. I get that it's difficult to make a great game that works perfectly and get it to market to satisfy shareholders and line pockets, but they should have let this one set in the oven a bit longer. Let the new breath of the wild come and go and give the fans a truly polished game that works as intended. I shouldn't be ramping off of random bits of geometry in the first 20 minutes of the game. I shouldn't be able to casually stroll up 90 degree walls. Not for $60. I've seen fan games with better physics.

In summary, if you want a good Sonic game, play what you like. If you want my suggestion, the Genesis 4 and Mania. (CD if you're feeling froggy). If you want a good open world adventure, Breath of the Wild or Genshin Impact have much more satisfying gameplay and soul to them then Frontiers.",,

How do I share this game with my friends without telling them it's a Sonic game?,,

"Personally I found the game overall boring and unfinished.
I ended defeated the final titan and the ""final boss"" but the game crashed during the end cutscene...so I just uninstalled it as I didn't want to keep playing or even redo it just to finish the cutscenes lmao.

I liked the free roam and getting to zoom around, but it's extremely repetitive. You're constantly collecting gears and keys to get the emeralds, I think 4 or 5 times? The lore itself is a little weak/lacking. The bosses were easy, I've fought more annoying bosses in past sonic games. The cyberspace missions felt similar to Forces (the sub missions gave me secret rings vibes which I liked) but longer and more enjoyable, although the controls were wonky in some places. But just because it was more enjoyable than Forces didn't make it good.

The collection of the items used to speak to your friends was alright UNTIL the final map. It somehow became more tedious and took forever.

The little side missions with your companions weren't very memorable to me, especially since all you needed was the little hearts/medallions/wrenches to speak to them...and it didn't add a whole lot to the story. You can progress to the 3rd island and have just a vague understanding what the koco's are but nothing really progresses, you're just kinda blasted with it at the end and it was kind of anti-climatic. It doesn't even go from 0-100 real quick it's more like 0-20 and back to 0 if that makes sense lol.

I liked the little mini games (from the companions not the challenges), I wish they brought more of those (and more variety) and less of the item collection. Didn't like the concept of cyber space, it just felt so odd and out of place. They could've gone with warping time/space, slap Infinite here instead.

I know why the map is so empty and devoid of life population-wise, I just wish it wasn't. The random scattering of courses(?) throughout the map didn't help.

The best thing out of this game is the soundtrack, in that I don't think any sonic game has failed yet.


I think if they combined their ideas from Forces with Frontiers it could've been a more interesting game story wise.",,
"Rating
9/10

Intro
This is perhaps the best Sonic game since Mania, and the best 3D Sonic game since Generations. Mind you, I still maintain that Forces was a good game, but it wasn't a great game by product of 4 years of its development mostly being spent on creating the Hedgehog 2 engine. Frontiers doesn't suffer from this issue, as it too was made on the same engine. But, this time they could focus on making the game itself, and it shows. It's basically Unleashed, but there's a more open world to explore, and you don't have to turn into a Werehog to do hack and slash combat.

Positives
+ Good story.
+ Good controls.
+ Great soundtrack.
+ Great level design.
+ Good replay value.
+ Plenty of content to play.
+ Combat has great impact.
+ Great aesthetics and graphics.

- Credits can't be skipped.
- There's no convenient statistics screen for completionists.
- Upgrading Sonic's stats is a slow and unskippable process.",,
"When the first trailer dropped, I seemed Skeptical, Second trailer looked awesome, the. i played it and it was as amazing as Metal Gear Rising, the story isn’t as bad as forces, the gameplay is amazing, and it feels like sonics finally back on his feet! And yes this game made me absolutely adore sonic again.

My only critique is the momentum, but other than that, solid 10/10 experience!",,
"sick open-zone. easy to understand combat and skill tree system, and a visually breathtaking game.
Good diversity in enemies, incorporating skills that you NEED to unlock to defeat them.
Great boss battle Music, Great open-zone OST.
Unlocking new parts of the map is refreshing, and fun. Think Assassins creed towers but 10x more diverse with a little challenge thrown in there (a very, very little challenge)

Cyberspace levels are stiff, and lack fluidity. Cyberspace levels lack diversity, and are nearly all done within a minute. (WTF)
Horribly stiff cutscenes, and a really odd momentum system thats cut and dry.
Collectibles are boring to collect.
Cyberspace levels are way too easy.

If the momentum was a bit quicker, cut-scenes are polished, and cyberspace levels were flat-out revamped to be more fluid, fast-paced and longer, this game probably could've been better than the adventure series. IMO",,

"Frontiers > Breath of the Wild

"Awesome game and a great way for Sonic to go in a new direction. Not perfect, but a much better outing than we've seen in recent years.",,
"""Most Sonic games feel like they were designed to get a Seven. They'd be happy with Seven. Sonic Frontiers isn't satisfied with that, it has so much to say! It's reaching for a Nine! It wants to be a TEN!""

""And what is it?""

""It's about an Eight!""

--

The gameplay on it's own is mixed at best, and the Momentum Mod is a must-have, in my opinion.

However, I grew up with an undiagnosed mental disorder and Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut: Revengeance, and the story has always been my main focus, which Frontiers delivers in wonderful abundance.

Find Your Flame is such a good song.",,

sonic,,
"Better than Forces (forces was a 6.5/10).
Fr tho, this may be one of my top open world games so far. Though it's a little buggy, Sonic Frontiers's gameplay loop isn't repetetive nor is it grating in the first place. The combat works a LOT better than '06, which had a lot of combat, especially in Shadow's levels. The moves are pretty basic at first but once you unlock more things can get crazy. Finally, the cyberspace levels managed to get me to start using some low-level speedrunning moves like stomp cancelling and air boosting.",,
"A miserable slog to play, 20+ hours of running around boring fields doing busywork to collect a billion different progression tokens. When it was announced I joked it looked like they dropped sonic in an unreal demo, and then that's exactly what it feels like. I like a lot of the character writing and if the story had fully landed for me I'd probably like the game anyway, but then the climax is a big wet fart. The ""final boss fight"" is a joke; it's very transparent that the devs played NieR Automata, thought they could pull off something similar, and did NOT have the story chops for it. Please just go play one of the many good platinum games (or sonic adventure 1+2 which are miles better than this).",,

"Where to start with this review…. The game is janky, like a family pet that just had its balls cut off and can’t walk straight, the design of which can only be deciphered by using some kind of ancient tablet.

If you eat your own snot and have uncontrollable drool problems, you may be able to transport yourself to parallel universe where all the games problems don't exist, in which case you may be deluded enough to believe you are having, what us humans call, 'fun'.

To explain my point, here are some baffling design choices (accidents?) in this game which include but are not limited to:

-Inconsistent physics (or perhaps more accurately – a series of glitches), with such logical intricacies as having momentum in the air when you fling yourself off a platform but not if you jump, among a million other annoyances.

-Cramped boring open worlds, that are at times confusing, and have been clearly put together in the final hour of production when the devs were staying alive on coffee and perhaps a smattering of hardcore drugs.

-Weird floating platforms everywhere on the map that force you between 2D and 3D that look like the intern (captive?) put them together tied to a chair at gunpoint.

-Janky fighting system that is a thing, I guess…

-Strange story pacing that trauma dumps on you before the final world, with what I can only explain as wet E.T. had space babies.

-Open world bosses that vary from ‘hmm okay’ to soul crushingly boring and finally blood boiling bore-athons

-An art style that a sweatshop would reject…

-References to previous games that will overload your cringe glands to the point of implosion.

-A million collectables such as keys, hearts etc. that unlock… cutscenes and… more platforming, a real treat.

-Cutscenes that have been beautifully hand animated with pain staking care and love by captive 'interns'.

-A disappointing final boss that make you debate whether it was being created (excreted?) in the final 15 minutes or 5 minutes of development.

-Giant toilets that allow you to play asset flip phone games.

Amongst many other problems that I cannot motivate my brain to even recall.

To conclude, Sonic Frontiers is very fun - a must play. Let all the family frontier into the passages of faecal mediocrity.",,
"this game is PEAK , just finished this game and wow the main story ending is TERRIBLE but the update ending WOW , it went HARDDDDDDDDDDD , the music is really good, and i love how jaank the physics are but it was in a good way to the point i could skip sections but like in a good way ( trust me ) the cyberspace missons are kinda ass but the levels themselves are fun ( not the 2d levels tho ) honestly a 9/10",,

The first Island starts out great. While the puzzles might not be the greatest and can get tedious. Not to mention the final puzzle before the boss is just... unacceptable. The bosses are cool first glance but lose their charm through more replay's. The further you get through the game the more the problems show. Just had the newest update and honestly it highlights the best parts and even the worst parts. Especially the worst parts. Just so many questionable design choices and the trials are just not good.,,

"Imma go review again, so this game is pretty slightly improvement.
About The Final Horizon Update, it is really satisfactory ending (contains major spoilers)

Here's the good thing about this game
- The combat seems to be great, its not bad at all
- Great Soundtrack
- Good story
- Additional Arcade
- Small amount of game's file storage less than 40-60 GB (which is good for small storage)
- Fishing!

The flaws
- Some Anticlimax in main ending (this was before it was reveal to be The Final Horizon)
- Annoying camera
- Automatically 2D side scrolling section in open world where you're running around the world.
- Denuvo, not because of bad performance but because they only connects online network even though this game is singleplayer
- Messy tons of rails n' platforms, they're ruined the beautiful landscape environment (thanks sonic team)

8/10, pretty okay game, id say this is one of the only good recent gen Sonic game, I was really huge disappointed about Sonic Forces' plot & gameplay.",,
"everyone hyped me so much for the game and when i played it, it was full with bugs and also i dont know why but the game dont like when i play with controller which is funny but annoying",,
boring imo,,
"The game stands strong amongst the entries of 3D Sonic games and is on par with the best ones, if for you those are, like for me, Sonic Adventure 1 and Sonic Robo Blast 2.

Some people are saying the game is grindy. I think they just don't like actually playing the game. I beat the whole game, 100%-d it, and at no point did it feel like a chore. I play Sonic to do some platforming action, so when I see a challenge, I just go for it and obtain the reward. As a result, only twice in > 20 hours did I find myself needing some resources that I didn't obtain naturally, and each time, it took less than 10 minutes of deliberate search. Though I can see how, if one just goes from one quest marker to another to advance the story, they could feel irritated when the game prevented further progress. I'd argue though that it's done for your own good: the later mandatory platforming challenges are actually tough, so skipping every non-mandatory challenge and rushing the story may not be a good idea.

While the foundation of the game is really strong, there are small issues abound. Maybe those will get fixed later, I'm not sure. Sonic Team does not have a good record of patching the old games. Sonic Generations still crashes for me when I do a TIme Attack, and it's been a known issue for years.





Despite these small gripes, I had a blast playing this, despite being very sceptical at first. If the concept of a 3D Sonic game appeals to you and you like Sonic Adventure 1 gameplay-wise and Sonic Adventure 2 story-wise, I'd argue that you owe it to yourself to try this.",,
"I've been a Sonic fan all my life and I had a positive attitude going into this game. I was hyped after hearing the soundtrack and the fact that many said this revived the blue blur. After battling the first boss Giganto... I cannot believe they were allowed to sell this for $60. It's actually insulting that the only thing good about this game is a soundtrack that you can listen to for free. If the game was actually polished, made interesting boss fights, got rid of the garbage and clutter in the open world then maybe I could call this a sonic game. At first I thought the devs were going in the right direction, but now I see that I was clearly wrong. Unless this game is 90% off I heavily recommend (even if you're a sonic fan) to stay away from this game.

Edit: Since I couldn't refund it I decided to play through the rest of it and as of now i've started the last island. Now I have changed a few opinions and I will say this game is ok, its just average. Now that does not mean it is a good game, the only reason people say that is because sonic games have become so bad that anything remotely average is seen as amazing. Most of my gripe is with the price, if this was a $15 game I would not complain and actually call it pretty decent. The islands are still pretty repetitive but the next 2 bosses were more innovative and impressive than that sorry excuse for a first boss. If you really do love sonic then buy the game, you'll get your fun out of it and who am I to judge? But it should really be bought on a sale.",,
"Sonic is finally back.

After Sonic Mid world and the disaster that was Forces and launch colors ultimate, we finally have a good 3D Sonic game since Generations.
From the boss fights to the open world its so good, but unfortunately its not perfect.

MAJOR SPOILER WARNING!.

Cons.

The game is way too easy even on the hardest difficulty, you don't even have to time the parry you can just hold the button down.

Spending 30 minutes grinding memory tokens just to watch a 30-45 second cutscene to back to grinding more memory tokens on Kronos island.

The story minigames are bad with some being worse then others especially the Laser pointing one, the bridge one, and the Ares Island Koco roundup.

There should've been more variety with the island designs, 3/5 Islands are grassy and that could've been fixed with Ouranos Island being snow themed.

The pop in is bad and needs to be fixed.

Due to Denuvo the game can sometimes hog up all of the CPU making the game freeze.

Giganto Bug that drops your frames to 30 if you die.

I didnt like how it cuts to a 30 FPS cutscene of Sonic throwing Wyvern against a cliff without a button prompt, while cool I still think it should've been in game without ruining the immersion by cutting to black.


Supreme,
He was obviously shoehorned in with him literally being a reskin of Giganto, and the fight was almost the exact same too, any new moves the boss had were just boring too.

The Final boss for hard mode,

Hey you know that voice that stops you from going out of bounds and progressing too early? No? too bad.

Next to no story importance, which is stupid because its supposed to be some sort of god.

And the fight itself?. Its literally just the space invaders minigame.

Now I know they were rushed and had to cut corners but really?, you couldn't have done any better?.

Whew now that that's out of the way lets get to the good stuff.

Pros.
The open world is so fun to explore especially when you have full rings with infinite boost.

The combat is so fun while a little buggy at times with some moves not wanting to register (looking at you wild rush), The over all combat works well.

Giganto.
Where do I begin, you first meet him and he demolishes you,
then once you have the 6 chaos emeralds you climb up him Shadow of the Colossus style and get the 7th chaos emerald and you have this incredible boss fight, with amazing music, and the overall feeling of being really powerful.

This sets a standard for Super Sonic one which will hopefully will be the case in future sonic games.

Knight.
Climbing up him Shadow of the Colossus style again was great. Riding on the shield back to him was really cool. The Boss theme is the best in the game. The 2nd phase with reflecting the shield back at him was awesome. And the end with Sonic parrying the sword and then picking it up and cutting him in half was something straight out of Metal Gear Rising and that's amazing.

The challenges to open up the map are fun.

Cyberspace.
While a little disappointing that there's only 4 level themes, trying to get S rank and complete all of the challenges was really fun, especially 1-2. The only thing I wish was changed is more then 4 level themes, the levels being a little bit longer, and better controls for the cyberspace levels.

Fishing.
It was very interesting to bring Big the cat back who hasn't been a main character in the series since Sonic Heroes in 2003. The whole fishing minigame was also a huge reference to Sonic Adventure with the theme for catching the fish being a remix of the one from Sonic Adventure.
Its also the best way to level up your stats with fish giving anywhere from 8 tokens to 75 depending on the size, with a tire giving you 48 tokens for some reason.

Climbing up the towers was really cool and a nice change of pace from grinding memory tokens.

The sound track for this game is Amazing.

The length is perfect.
The game is 3x longer then sonic forces for just main plus extra,
and that's not including the upcoming DLC and the fact that they were rushed near the end of development.

And finally the mod support. The mod support for the game is incredible, with people already making mods before the game even came out.

I'm finally glad everyone realized that the awful gameplay provided to us by Ign was an early beta build of the game and not the full game.

I still remember everyone complaining about how it looked like a Unity game and how it was gonna be terrible, and how me and my friends all knew it was beta footage and that the game was gonna be good. I'm glad the game turned out how it is, while not perfect it still is in my top 5 favorite sonic games, and my 10th favorite game of all time. 8.5/10",,

"Very fun overall.
The game has it's cons, but it's still enjoyable. The OST is one of the best things about it. The story is okay, it's generic, the only good things you should look forward to is the characterisation. You will get tired of doing the same things over and over though. Island 1 is the most enjoyable. I would suggest not even trying hard mode, since it's not even rewarding. The game is easy up until the hard mode final boss, even then, the final boss is extremely annoying and not fun.

The game could improve upon not reusing the same plot over and over. You are literally always searching for the emeralds, and doing the same stuff to get them over and over. Cyberspace will become boring. I literally did fishing the throughout Island 3 - 5, because the fishing is more enjoyable to do. Fishing is a cool mini-game and extremely rewarding. Another thing, this game is not the best when it comes to how it's made, from a developer perspective.

Huge step in the right direction though. I hope to see something well-built and enjoyable in the future.",,

"When considered as a standalone, individual game in the series, Sonic Frontiers feels like a frustratingly half-formed idea, roughly marrying two relatively disparate styles of gameplay and wrapping them in a story that is incredible in some aspects and frustratingly sparse in others. Considered as an evolution of the messy, directionless 3D Sonic era, however, Sonic Frontiers is a fantastic foundation to build on, expressing interesting ideas about open-world gameplay and a clear mission statement for the future of the franchise.

3D Sonic has been a mess for a long time, mired in the lifeless boost-style gameplay that's formed the cornerstone of every 3D Sonic game since Sonic Unleashed (minus Lost World, which, let's not get into that). The core of Frontiers's gameplay departs from that, by slowing Sonic down just enough that he becomes much more controllable, but also by massively expanding the play area by way of the game's ""open zones,"" basically five open-world islands for you to traverse as you please, with little micro-stages scattered all around to be run through for progression rewards. In the open zones, Sonic controls fantastically - homing attack is unbound from the jump button, Sonic can traverse pretty much any surface within reach, and it never felt to me like driving a car, the way the boost games tend to feel. The islands give you a lot to do, and while admittedly it can get a little repetitive wiping bosses and handling simple puzzles, I think there's enough variety on an initial playthrough to keep you interested as you meet the collection-based objectives to advance the story.

On that note, the story is both sparse and rich in character work - it feels like the desolate islands and lack of NPCs was a way of easing into this new game design, and hopefully that'll result in a more vibrant world next time, should Sonic Team not decide to arbitrarily throw out this gameplay structure (not a guarantee). The characters feel more alive and like residents of this world than they have in a very long time, likely thanks to Ian Flynn's work on the script and specific story beats. Sage is an intriguing pseudo-antagonist, but she also feels like an under-delivery, with plenty of hints about what she could be, without a lot of follow-through. I would hope to see her again to develop her further, but given the way the narrative uses her, it's probably not super likely. The rest of the cast, though, are fantastically written - continuity has never been a strong aspect of Sonic games, but here it feels like these characters truly have known each other a long time, not just from the frequent references to previous games, but just in the way they talk to each other, the way it seems like there's real progression in their relationships, leaving this game different from how they came in. It's lovely, and I hope it's indicative of future stories.

What I really didn't like, however - and this is almost certainly an unpopular opinion as a whole - was Cyber Space. Not just the implementation, though the lazy re-use of Genesis level themes AGAIN, and the fact that there are just four themes for the 30 or so Cyber Space stages, certainly didn't inspire me as I played through them. No, it was the fact that these are typical boost levels that really bothered me. Sonic controls like a tank, barely able to turn and flying off the edges of the stages if you don't exert absolutely rock-solid control over him. It's a far cry from how he moves in the open zones, and it was jarring to jump into Cyber Space after running around the open world for a while and find that Sonic absolutely sucked to control. The actual level layouts did feel like an improvement over previous boost stages, requiring more platforming than I was expecting given their typically short length, but they still have the ridiculously bad 2D sections and remain fundamentally garbage boost levels. I really hope that, should we see the open zone design return, that Sonic's movement in those is transferred over to action stages.

I'm not going to bother with the technical issues, you've heard about those plenty already. Plus, I played on Steam Deck, which likely introduced its own weirdness when running the game through Proton, so I'm not sure how much of my experience was hardware-related vs. software-related.

On the whole, Frontiers feels like a mission statement for the future, a bold move on Sonic Team's part that we typically either don't see at all from them, or see in a baffling, inexplicably bad implementation. It feels in a lot of ways like a beta test, which is unfortunate for a mainline series game, but if this is what it takes to get a 3D Sonic game that isn't either stunningly boring or terrible, I'll take it. It feels like Sonic Team is handing us a voucher to be redeemed on the next game. Hopefully, that voucher doesn't expire before we get there.",,
"A great sonic game with some issues, but that paints the picture for its future way brighter than the 3 previous messes we got were.

Amazing OST as always. The game is pretty good at the start, then in the 3rd island kinda drops the ball with so many awful 2d segments... on a 3d free roam zone, not a good combination. Great story and hype bosses.

Cyberspace stages are... fine. But could've gone without them, didn't really like them at all.",,

Really good game honestly want a 2nd game for sonic frontiers because it is that great. Honestly worth the price for the story and music the game offers. I love everything about this game and can't wait to see what's next for the sonic team. I wish we could have more games like this one. Also love seeing parts of other sonic games in cyberspace levels giving it a nostalgic feeling. The only thing I wish for is more dlcs and updates to add to this game or making a second game entirely. Only issue I had was things took a little while to load in the game if you moved too fast. Overall I give this game a 9/10.,,
"After playing a couple of hours and opening up the world for exploration, all I can see is lack of imagination and repetition. I really wanted this game to be the sequel in spirit to Sonic Adventure we all deserve, but it falls short in several places.

First off, the story (albeit I don't have much time into it) is completely out there. There is almost no introduction to why things are happening. It is not cohesive at all. Again, drawing from experiences with Sonic Adventure which pieced together hours of different perspectives into a single story, this game just doesn't fit the bill.

Secondly, controls are bad. Sonic feels really slow at times in the open world. In the levels you run through for keys, it is a completely different speed. The controls for this feel clunky and not very natural.

Thirdly, the levels you play for keys are very uninspired and serve only as filler for what could have otherwise been great gameplay. These levels are geared for you to fly through it, admiring nothing, and try to get the fastest time. If you didn't, the only incentive to replay it is to get 1 more key for your efforts.

Lastly, leveling up your attacks and movement could have been a solid feature, but it is a near miss as a result of how bonkers it is. You have to collect ""seeds"" which you then have to take to a specific point in the map; why not just make it an easy level up in the menu like you do for unlocking skills. This addition was an unnecessary design choice, and a definitely one that doesn't pay off.

All in all, the graphics are good, but not great. And any sort of admiring of the world you would have done is traded in at the expense of trying to race through levels as quickly as humanly possible to get one more key. Sound seems good as well, but not enough to pull everything together.

All in all, I am very disappointed with how this game turned out. They had a lot of potential and opportunity that was just ignored. I couldn't wait to play Sonic Adventure to find out what happened to each character in their own chapters. With Sonic Frontiers, I could care less because the writers just failed to draw you into to any semblance of a story. I am not sure I will even continue to play this game.",,
"Alright so basically, this game is amazing, go in blind, have fun, i played this long cause i enjoy so much from it, i'm a huge sonic fan so maybe it is bias, but this is such a huge step up from the last 3D sonic game, in every way, story wise, gameplay wise, music wise. it looks beautiful, it's great, although there are some issues, including the extreme amounts of pop in, a good amount of puzzles are too easy (although there are a good couple that aren't very easy), game also has denuvo and a good couple of people are experiencing issues due to that fact, and theres a good amount of jank (although personally it feels like jank in a good way, if that makes sense). Some people question whther the game is worth being full price (60$), i personally feel very fulfilled with the purchase and think it was worth the money. i'd give this game a solid 8 to a light 9, its not perfect, but i enjoyed it so much that i can pretty easily overlook the issues, the good outweighs the bad on such a huge scale for me",,
"Game isn't perfect, but the longer one plays and unlock more skills and power for Sonic, the better it starts to get! Bosses are a blast, story is pretty nice change of pace from the goofy sat am cartoon plots most Sonic games had before this. I'd say give it a try. Don't expect game of the year, expect a fun game with a sick ost and some amazing boss fights and a simple, yet, fun combat system!",,

"i think there should be an option to have sonic remove his shoes, imagine how funny that would be if he took off his shoes and his feet were pretty sweaty because of how much he runs around in all the areas, haha i think that would be pretty funny",,
"Quite a peculiar title. Not a single soul could make anything clear out of the trailers at first. But with more info provided we saw something interesting. Even critics are a bit divided on this.
After 5 hours of gameplay, I'd say I enjoy the game overall. Time the throw in some pros and cons.

Pros:
1. The game looks pretty nice overall, especially the cyber space levels.
2. The combat system is simple yet fun.
3. Sonic's controls are polished and it really feels good to run around in the open-zone.
4. I might not have experienced the whole story, but it already is times better than the latest titles.
5. Music's good, but hey, why wouldn't it be.
6. You can upgrade Sonic's stats, which is fun, but the addition seems unnecessary.
Cons:
1. The cyber space levels are meh, nothing bad about them, but not really fun.
2. The amount of pop-in is quite sad. There will be a plenty of times you run into unloaded rocks and
stuff like that.
3. The open-zone doesn't have a huge number of collectibles.
4. It seems like the game the skill tree is unbalanced, it's possible to get all skills before the first island's boss fight.
5. Boss fight spoiler:
6. The VA is fine, but everyone sounds unenthusiastic.

The game's pretty cool. I'd give it a 7/10. If you are a fan of the series then I'd suggest you try it out for yourself, there is lots of fun to be had. But the pricing is kinda steep, so scout for a discount in the future.",,
"Honestly, as far as i've played tonight i had a LOT of fun! it's just really interesting going around the island searching for stuff!... and since you are always kinda doing ""parkour"" it's not like it's boring at all... i was worried because the world looked kinda ""empty"" at the beggining based on screenshots and a few videos, but after playing it i can assure it's such a fun experience... Beware of the Denuvo DRM, i haven't come across any trouble in my gameplay (GTX 1660 Super - Ryzen 3 3100), but some people is complaining about stuttering and crashes (not my case at all, but i'll warn just in case)... The only thing i would critizise from this game is the Mouse sensitivity... i wouldn't recommend playing with mouse + keyboard only because of that, no matter the sens you put in options, it's always weird, like, it's really really slow and it doesn't help the game pace... Anyway, hope you found this mini review helpful...

[Edit cause i forgot something REALLY important]

Till now, i've played only 3 hours, but you can already tell the story and the characters attitude is waaay better than later games... they feel more mature and less ""haha, let's do a silly joke and continue the story""... characters actually interact with each other, which is something we didn't have from a Sonic game for quite a few years... Let's hope it continues that way!",,

"For those of you who have never played a Sonic game, I pity you. I truly do. However, this one has missed the mark. I apologise to all the sonic fans who have eagerly awaited his games throughout the years, but this one is simple slow, boring and messy.",,
"Sonic Frontiers, as an overall package, is a decent 7.5/10 experience. However, if you are a casual looking in who doesn't care all that much about Sonic, I don't believe you will be able to have the experience the developers intended. There are many instances where you really only experience this games full magic if you have, at the very least, really liked Sonic during your childhood. Although, to be frank, with this new expansion, I can't recommend this game to you at all if you are not already a Sonic fan. If you are a Sonic fan, you probably already have this game, or already plan to get it, whether reviews say it's good or not. The new stuff is simply not cooked enough, or high enough of quality for it to be a good example of what a Sonic game should be to outsiders, which really *really* sucks. Really hope the next game is better.",,
Amazing game - Vote this to win best soundtrack in the steam awards!,,
fun game,,
He is so very cool,,
"The Good:
- Sonic controls great in the open zones.
- Combat is simple, yet satisfying.
- Best story since Unleashed, please let Ian Flynn keep writing the stories and characters.
- The lore is off the charts in this game (Shadow the Hedgehog is still canon wtf.)
- Music slaps, as always.
- Titan boss fights gave me goosebumps.

The Bad:
- Cyberspace levels control like ass and are too short.
- If I see Green Hill in one more game, I'm going to have an aneurysm.
- I love spending 10 minutes mashing the A button while Elder Koko upgrades my abilities one at a time.
- Islands 4 and 5 were clearly rushed, both taking place on Kronos again.
- No seriously, all you do on island 4 is climb Far Cry towers, why did this need it's own map?
- Easily the worst final boss in the series. Yes Sega, after 4 genuinely amazing Super Sonic titan fights, I want to finish the game out playing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Galga.

"Ok... I just finished the game (update 3 included) and I'm going to edit my review... >.>
I think this game will remain legendary. The boss fights are EPIC and, overall, the game loop is pretty fun.
Unfortunately has issues, that I don't think will be fixed because are common in almost any Sonic game (camera movement, controls...)
And unfortunately the last update (the final horizon) is unfair. A lot of people were disappointed of the difficulty spike (compared to the base game). I can understand, because I felt the same and almost gave up with the game. It's hard to complete, even on easy mode, but you have, because there is the REAL final battle. Dear play, if you find the difficulty too high, set the easy mode: many things will change (the game doesn't tell you) and follow the tricks of the other players (for the trials and the final boss fight) and... to you, Sonic Team, work on balancing better your next games. Games should be enjoyable by anyone. That's why we have (and you introduced) different difficulties in games, isn't it?

Here my previous review (😁):

Sonic Frontiers was a good game, until they released the Final Horizon update. The story of the latest update is unplayable: the game seems broken and everything is frustratingly difficult, both because the controls and camera work poorly, and because the difficulty is not balanced at all. With this update, Sonic Team has revealed itself as what it has always been: incompetent. I probably won't buy any more Sonic games in the future because the quality is just too low. Playing through this update is useless, you're just wasting your precious time. Don't do it. I gave up and went to watch the gameplay on YouTube, just out of curiosity. Here I noticed that players were using glitches in the game itself to be able to complete the worst part of all: climbing the towers. I don't think it's even possible to finish the update without using the glitches. Enough. I don't even want to waste any more words or energy on such a terrible game. Do not waste your time. I warned you.",,
"Product refunded

I want to preface this review by saying that I'm very biased, I am a huge Sonic Adventure 1 and 2 fan, and I will mostly be talking about why I dislike Frontiers in context of that fact. I understand that these games are just not made for me, but I wanted to give a warning to other SA1 - '06 era fans who might be in the same situation I was in and are on the fence whether to put in the asking price to try the game: this isn't the end of the boost era.

The game going open world does not alleviate any of the boost era issues that have plagued the series since Unleashed. In-fact they are very much compounded here, somehow making even the activities you can do in the open world as restrictive and linear as any ordinary boost era level, but with even less mechanical challenge.

You've got an assortment of random interactable stuff, like springs that launch you all over the place in a sequence over a pit to get a collectable or grind rails in the sky you can hop between to get the collectable at the end, but it still restricts a lot of player freedom and control that was given to us in SA1, SA2 and even '06. None of them are very satisfying in any capacity, and looking up later ones they don't seem to get interesting ever. The open world is full of this stuff, but it still manages to feel empty because the lack of actual player engagement. Running around it is fun I guess, but it's not like this is exclusive to Frontiers so it's not necessarily revolutionary or worth the price of a full game.

Cyberspace levels are the epitome of the boost formula in little compact 2-2:30 minute long stages with some objectives you can clear in them. If you weren't a fan of previous boost levels in previous 3D sonic games, they are those but with way less thought put into them than an actual level from the previous entries.

In comparison, I find levels from Sonic Adventure 1 for example are far less developer controlled. You can bend whole levels to your knee with your potential movement via jumping out of spindashes on slopes, and whether or not it's intended design to allow players to skip major sections of levels like this, I find the experience more engaging and rewarding. True successors to the Adventure era games lie instead in indies that have released that emulate it far better than the boost formula ever could. Games like , , and are all platformers that come to mind that combine speed with high potential for exploitation via movement mechanics that was the core of why I loved Sonic Adventure so much. (There's also

The game is also, as expected, littered with bugs and oddities. I had one flat out crash my whole computer at one point and others that got me completely stuck in terrain, clipping weirdly into objects and all in all it's just much more annoying seeing these same bugs plague full release priced titles in 2022.

Again though, I acknowledge that boost era games are not for me. I've just heard so many mixed reports on whether or not this was considered one, and after having gotten to play it for a bit: yeah, it's still a boost game. And you know what? I'm sure it's a pretty good one, even. I just don't recommend it to fans like me who were waiting for something like a true new Sonic Adventure game.",,
"I just finished playing the game. ALL IM GONNA say is...its good if you are 16. the ""puzzles"" aren't fun, the bosses aren't challenging, the open world isn't really that open, and the camera is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying. constantly ripping control from you and forcing you to look in very inconvenient ways. honestly over all i found the game very boring. it was like you were watching one long cinematic.",,

"So far I'm enjoying this game. The only issue I have is for some odd reason on my 144hz monitor when I turn V-sync off, I get screen tearing. Not sure what that's all about. Maybe I need to adjust some settings with my GPU or monitor? Idk. Other than that..I love it! The feel of zipping through an open world is really satisfying.",,
"GOOD:
- Acknowledgment of previous games as past events
- Eggman is developed as an actual character
- The best controls in the entire franchise (I'm not a fan of all the buttons and combos, but it's finally possible to recover from mistakes)
- Cinematic bossfights!!! (Playing as Super Sonic has never felt so powerful and engaging)

BAD:
- The story is an afterthought (Ripping apart your story and scattering it across an open world map under the lock of an amount of collectables is not good delivery.)
- There are still required 2D platforming elements (I really wish Sega would recognize 2D and 3D platformers as the separate genres that they are. The extra pandering to the classic fans is killing Adventure fans, thanks.)

Despite there being more bullets in the 'GOOD' column, the 'BAD's just outweigh the good in my enjoyment. (primarily because the gameplay has sucked for years, so the only thing keeping me engaged in this franchise is the story, which was absolutely sidelined for this installment)

It wasn't that the story was bad -- there were parts of it that were really weird and engaging (which was my favorite part of the first Adventure game) -- the story just didn't feel like it was ever...told.
I won the game, but I'm still not exactly sure what happened. I might have been told, but with the sheer hours splitting up cutscenes consisting of two characters staring at each other and sharing only a few lines, nothing ever stuck.",,
"After Forces I had 0 expectations but DAYUM!!! It's genuinely fun and gave me goosebumps many times, it is a joy to control and boss fights are an absolute treat. It's also surprising how well the characters were handled this time around!

Make sure browse the settings though, there's a checkbox to slow you down when you jump by default, wild.",,

Really excited to play this game completely.",,
"I don't think This game is not worth the price tag. The side step only works at intended in some levels or specific situation other time it takes you way to far into the stage wall halting all speed , the setting are bare-boned at best and the game can feel incredibly slow in a lot of cases. It is a step in the right direction in my mind. Why do I have more than 12 hours? cause I'm a sonic fan and I lover the music love how they depict sonic and the cast so far and the super sonic sections are great. So i Don't recommend this game if your not a sonic fan but get it if you think you would like it.",,
"Edit : Spelling

Don't get me wrong, I love Sonic as a character, but this feels way too much like a worse BOTW clone.

I very much like the new formula they're going for. Trying to find all the platforms in the tutorial and figuring out how to complete them was the most fun I've had on a Sonic game in a while. The combat moves are very stylish and I love the pace.

Sadly the bosses and enemies are ridiculously easy to beat. I'm really not a god gamer. You can absolutely shred every enemy and if you take damage, just make a cyberloop. You can get an infinite amounts of rings with a cyberloop. Forever.

Let me explain. By holding a button and making a loop you drop rings which then magnetise onto you after a few seconds. This basically makes you invulnerable. And acquiring rings isn't a challenge anymore. I'm surprised no one working as a QA at SEGA noticed that. You can earn 400 rings in like 30 seconds easily. And even other items drop with Cyberloops. The tension is completely lost, and so is my enjoyment because of it.

The Koko mechanic made me laugh. I see what you did there; they're just worse Korok seeds. They're not really hidden, you can see and hear them, you just gotta pick them up. And then trade with the Elder Korok for bonus stats. This isn't what made Korok seeds fun SEGA. It's finding them that make it enjoyable. Scattering them around is just half of the mechanic that make the BOTW Korok seeds what they are.

The Cyberspace levels are very beautiful, I love the effects. But the levels aren't enjoyable to me. I do admit I've only played two, but seriously the top paths in 1-2 aren't rewarding at all. You can only get an S if you keep going through boost pads and ignoring enemies. Is that all what Sonic games are now? I felt Generations and Unleashed had a better understanding of what made the sense of speed worth it in the ""boost"" era of games.

As for graphics in the open-zone :
On PC the game has a bad render distance for foliage, lots of popping (some segments took like 10 seconds to load, come on, we're Sonic, are we just supposed to stand there?) and it looks very aliased or pixelated. I've checked my settings twice, tried changing my anti-aliasing and it still looks kind of blurry. You can't go past TAA, FXAA, or a Rendering Resolution of 100%. And, I don't think it is due to my graphics card (RTX 2060). This makes it look like a game in the midpoint between the PS3 and the PS4 era. I mean Forces looked better than this, and I couldn't stand the gameplay, at all!

With all of that said, I'm glad they're heading into that direction for gameplay. Once again, it just needed much more polish... Dear AAA studios, stop releasing games that aren't ready.

Sincerely, a Sonic fan

P.S: Because of the pros mentioned above, I'd recommend grabbing it if happens to be at a much lower price. I'll gladly pick it up a bit lower than half the 60$ price tag.",,
this game sucks,,
Feels more like a student project.,,
"So if you're a sonic fan, and had the dream as a kid to run around an open world as Sonic while still having traditional stages to zoom through, absolutely get this game.
The open world (or area's I guess) have plenty to do, the stunts layed out in the world look kinda ugly but never get boring (to me), the 3D speed stages are super well designed and Sonic controls super nicely for the first time in a while. I could do without the 2D stages though, they're very floaty feeling.
That being said, as a game I give it a 7/10.
It isn't super polished and it totally feels like it was made from The Nintendo Switch up.
It has flaws such as the pop ins, short camera lock on range and dynamic mini cut scenes for mini bosses/powerups you've seen 50 times already.
60 FPS cap and the cutscenes and graphics overall do no reflect a $60 price tag.
It's a $45 game I'd say and I'm really trying not to be bias as I am a huge Sonic fan.

BUT, it is a really fun game and it legitimately makes you feel like Sonic. I see myself putting at least 80-100 hours into it.

EDIT: There's an arcade mode that lets you replay and store your best times on the speed levels once you beat the main game.",,
"This game is just awful, not fun and poorly written. Not only does it suck, it's ""hard"" difficulty only may be hard for 3 year olds. It's sucks badly and I wish I had played it the day I bought it so I could refund this garbage. I can't believe people see nothing wrong with this game, the overworld has as much content as a superflat world in Minecraft. The music is also some 2022 emo ♥♥♥♥ and not some funky sonic tune. It's a Sonic game! Why do you feel the need to make it appealing to todays audiance by making this game the definition of lifeless and depressed? I don't want to finish this piece of dogwater, but I have to so people don't cry about that I haven't even finished it. Like it's going to make the game better. In case you are wondering, I never skip cutscenes, as much as I hate them here because they just don't make sense and are awful, I always listen to the story so I can know what I'm talking about when I rant about ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games.

Update: So appareantly there are 5 islands, doesn't make this game better considering it's easier than playing Winnie the Pooh games. But so far every point still stands.

Update 2: I have no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ motivation to play this dog-ass game, I'll eventually come back, but it's just too awful. Also I'm out of space so I'm deinstalling some pieces of piss sacks",,
"Really enjoying Hog Stranding right now. The gameplay is on-point, the open world is fun to explore, the music is great, battles/challenges are varied, and there's a fishing minigame.

If you're looking for the ""...but"" here it is: The controls can be janky, I don't think the VAs were given amazing direction, and the overall aesthetic doesn't scream Sonic. I mean the juxtaposition of a cartoon animal in a weirdly photorealistic setting is
a little jarring.

Hog of the Wild for game of the year.

Final Horizon Update: Critically, it feels very rushed. There are very very fun moments but certain trials made me want to rip teeth out and some new open world courses for Amy/Knuckles/Tails were broken. That said, when the game shined it shined bright. I really want to see more like this but Sonic Team needs the resources.",,

"Didnt like it, it was very laggy and when i turned down the graphics it looked so bad i couldnt even read the text",,
"""Oh man! That's just begging to be climbed! Imagine the view!""",,
"Another Triple AAA price for a game that has issues: The only reason i got this game was for my steam deck, and it runs like hot garbage on it, Constant flickering with the lights, stuff just randomly pops in and out, less than 30fps at times (on lowest settings). Though in actual levels the performance seams to stable out.

With the games current issues i would not get it if you only plan on having a steam deck, if you own a pc then the game runs fine.",,
"This is the Sonic game I've been waiting for since SA/SA2. Open world, with platform and action stage levels. RPG like progression, side quests, and a bunch of other optional side missions. The stages are kind of short, but it works out. 10/10 would recommend",,
"Sonic is BACK! Combat and movement feel really really good, especially in the open zone areas. Cyberspace stages are surprisingly good breaks between running around the open zones. Wish there was more skills to unlock, a few more islands to run around, and more titan fights, but overall a solid first entry into a new open-world style of gameplay. It's very much a collect-a-thon, but I think for a first attempt it works well. I got 17 hours out of it in my first play through and still need to go back and get some of the achievements and complete challenges, but depending on if you just rush after the objectives or take time to explore your mileage may vary. Very enjoyable and lots of call backs to the previous Sonic games. That really made the little kid in me who grew up on Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2 really really happy.

The titan fights are absolutely epic and I definitely want more of that in the future. Would really be cool if we could fly around an island as Super Sonic after clearing it too. Afaik that isn't something that can be done, but I also haven't 100% the game.

Spoiler Thoughts:",,
"Game feels good and is by far way better than forces.
Played through the game when it first came out and fell in love again with the added free DLC.

NOW PORT UNLEASHED TO PC",,
By Far the best sonic game out of the whole franchise,,
"After a long hiatus from Sonic, It's grand to see him return once more. Sonic Frontiers takes the player to all these mysterious lands, and that looming sensation of a bigger picture is always within every cut-scene. The gameplay itself (combat, puzzle solving, exploration) felt great in the first two islands, yet did begin to get stale towards the end.
There are some context inconsistencies with some characters such as beating the island and then doing the side quests, making it seem like the side quest took place before beating the island or on the final island where you're still receiving aid from the voice in the sky.
Pop-ins are unfortunately still occurring in the build that I'm reviewing but it has not interrupted or became a hindrance to my overall play-through.
The illusion of open world is relevant throughout the whole game, what I mean by that is the collectibles are farm-able through many means, but Memory Tokens to rescue friends and Vault Keys to get chaos emeralds are mandatory to continue moving forward in the story.
Super Sonic boss fights were incredible spectacles to play but are one and done with no way to challenge them again on a single save.
Cyberspace movement can feel a little stiff but I had no issue S-Ranking every cyberspace stage and I overall enjoyed my time in each stage, the music being a massive highlight as every level has a unique music track. The short overall level design made it a lot easier to retry levels and get those final missions that were missed.
The writers for the story were on their game to capture the setting of Sonic Frontiers. Every character in Sonic Frontiers has been fine tuned to their personality, making them feel alive and a part of the world, from the way they speak in conversation to their facial expressions and tone.
The story of sonic frontiers is nothing complicated and is more of a journey of discovery and mystery, but picks up in suspense as the player continues. The first ending cut-scene is incredibly sad with a rebound cut-scene after, and the credits themes were a wonderful cherry on-top of this glorious adventure.
Fantastic game, improved character personalities, with music that does not disappoint in any moment. This is a must play for any sonic fan.",,
Its really fun to enjoy,,
Best Sonic game of the past 10 years easily.,,
"Product refunded

Best Sonic game yet!",,
♥♥♥♥ was boring and janky,,
"Sonic Frontiers is a peak gaming experience that everyone should play. A truly wonderful game from beginning to end, aside from a few visual shortcomings. In addition to fun movement and great platforming challenges, it also has surprisingly fun and nuanced combat, a great story, an excellent soundtrack, and truly EPIC, AMAZING BOSS BATTLES. Plus you get to enjoy fishing with Big the Cat :)",,
"This game is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ close to being fun, but the platforming and combat mechanics are so unbearably inconsistent and clunky that you'll find several of your deserved victories being snatched away by unpolished programming and design. Every time this game tries to be epic with its boss fights, the mood and gameplay is tarnished by the combat combos just magically deciding not to work for some unexplained reason, at key moments when you need them to work with only seconds to live. And then it goes and ♥♥♥♥♥ me over with quick-time events that shoot me all the way back to the beginning of the battle, with me having to pray that my combo attacks won't magically not work on my new attempt. And that's assuming I even have the patience to try again after such a cheap way to die. God ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ damn it.",,
Sage.,,
awesome!!! i caught a marlin,,
make a dlc were tales is a femboy,,
sonic,,
I would unironically Die for this game.,,
"This game isn't that great. The combat is sluggish, the bosses are half-baked, and you can just keep using the cyloop to get infinite free rings and mas out your attack and defense stats, though it takes forever. The only good parts of this game (in my opinion) are the soundtrack and the concept of this game, as well as the addition of Sage, though I think it's a shame that her debut game is so half-baked and janky. I hope Sega can make this IP great again, because at this point, the fangames carry Sonic HARD. Also can't wait to pay 10 bucks to get stuff I was promised in the digital deluxe preorder in Origins as well. Man I hate the state of the franchise. The Murder of Sonic was a banger and was free tho so I guess that redeems it.",,
"Terrible game. The graphics are back from the PS3/Xbox 360 era. With a 6800 XT there is major pop in. The levels are not making any sense. Story is not interesting. Gameplay is fun but it gets repetitive and boring really fast. You just round around collecting stuff. There is major auto save issue. During the third level the memory tokens you collect are wiped out and you have to collect them again if you fall into the lava for some reason. Same issue can also be seen with boss fights. There was this boss fight where there was a quick time event at the end. I failed the quick time event, cause I did not anticipate it. First one to appear halfway thought the game. The failed quick time event resulted in redoing the entire boss encounter which is a complete faceroll.",,
sonc but zelda,,
"Sonic Frontiers is a fun game, but a lot of its flaws are extremely glaring and makes me believe that the game was released unfinished. If it had another year of development it would've been the best 3D Sonic game since Sonic Adventure 2. (7.5/10)",,
"Cloud saves are broken. Prepare to have your the data on all of your devices overwritten by vastly outdated saves if you switch between multiple devices. The ""Steam Cloud"" listen on the store page is false advertising. After checking the cloud sync logs that every Steam user has access to, I can confirm this game sends outdated saves to the cloud server. You have been warned.

The controls in the game are completely unintuitive. If you step away from this game for any amount of time, be prepared to forget basically every control option.The light speed dash is mapped to L3, the parry is a combination of the boost button and the button that does one of several random attacks, and the jukebox is mapped to holding the right dpad button.

Boosting on seemingly flat terrain will launch Sonic into the air where he will flip around like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for several seconds while you have no control. If you're going for score in the new timed challenges, be warned that you will frequently lose all control for long periods of time, possibly multiple times. Calling the controls in this game ""unreliable"" is an understatement. Sometimes you will be boosting off a ledge and nosedive straight into the ground while maintaining contact with the cliff side, other times you will switch into spinning ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mode and fly into the void. There is no way to tell what affects this as running off the same cliff in the same way will produce different results.

Everything else you've heard about this game is true. Trash story, trash voice directing, trash animation, trash level design, reused assets, mindless overworld activities, and the most forgettable music conceived by man.

No patches can fix this game - it is broken at its core. One of the few games I can say is irredeemably bad. I had enough fun with the game initially, but coming back to it I am absolutely blown away that I ever put up with this garbage. The fact that I paid full price for this game is absurd, but I would happily pay triple that price in exchange for the hours of time I spent playing this game to be returned to me. This is a warning. Don't waste your life playing Sonic Frontiers. You will get nothing out of it. You won't take away some kind of powerful message, or an emotional resonance, or a rewarding sensation. You won't even have a better idea of how not to make a game because there is no parallel for comparison. Sonic Frontiers stands alone in terms of design and execution. Let's hope it stands alone forever.",,
"Yes its a great sonic game! Highly Recommend you buy this!
And yes it is a review of the Switch version but the game runs and looks better on PC. But it runs very smooth regardless.
One Problem with PC version, Even worse on Steam Deck and that issue is denuvo. Sega needs to remove it.

No Spoilers.The newest 3D Sonic game is out on Nov8 and i got to play it early, is it a bad game? or is it a blast to play?",,
holy sonic,,
Ohio Island is da best part of this game fr fr,,
Sonic Forces with waaaaaaaaay waaaaaaaay waaaaaaaaay more padding and worse Sonic levels,,
"25 hours to 100%, if you like a challenge in your platformers look elsewhere",,
its ok i guess,,
"This game really is an improvement to sonic games in general. I'm very pleased with the mechanics of sonic's combat and that you can literally run anywhere as sonic. I really think if this game gets a sequel, it should take place in station square and mystic ruins; Sonic should return to that city. It would just be spiderman ps4 meets sonic the hedgehog and I'm down for that.",,
"Just mediocre honestly. Really Repetitive overall. Go get keys! Oh can't get keys without Gears! Go get Gears! Go get Keys! Now Go Get The Emerald! Find (Character) ! Go get more keys ! Find (Character) ! Get Emerald!

Eventually you skip all of this (at least I did) and eventually. went fishing (Go fishing!) Which lets you breeze past the collection part of this garbage. But having to go fish to get all the achievements as well was really sad. Extremely time consuming and not fun. Overall just a mediocre experience. The running feels good. But that's it.",,
"Maybe if they hammer out the bugs and the poor programming this game would be worth playing, but to completely hard lock yourself because you leveled up, chose the only available skill, and then are later prompted to unlock that same skill and cant progress is just ridiculous",,
I can only recommend this game if you dont bother with the final DLC. by far the worst time ive ever had playing a sonic game short of maybe 06. The base game could be a buggy mess at time but it rarely took away from the fun factor. the new update however highlight how awful the controls can be. just watch the ending on youtube its not worth the effort.,,
"This game is pretty mid, top tip for the true final boss fight if you play on hard you can skip it if you change the difficulty mid-fight and still get the post-credit scene.",,
i spent 9 hours to completely 100% the first island. this game is totally worth every penny! Sonic is definitely carving a new frontier for the franchise and im loving it!,,
The Best 3D Sonic game.,,
Game left me pleasantly surprised.,,
Great open world Sonic game,,
"+ Open world running around is fun
+ The cyber zones are cool, some of the S times are actually challenging
+ Better voice acting than Kingdom Hearts 3
+ Lots of collectibles and things to do
+ You can go fast

"Everyone says its good for a sonic game but that doesnt make it a thumbs up game. Forced to do unfun minigames in the middle of the story, terrible checkpoints in bosses. super sonic minimum rings given for the first boss is 100 so you have to run in a circle using cyclone to get more but it doesnt tell you that. just gives you a boss thats basically impossible to kill. When you wipe youre way back at the start of every checkpoint. terrible pinball game where its just rng until you get a combo of 128 or 255 without dropping a ball.,

The open world aspect is hampered by things to do in it. if you accidentally hit a dashpad youre forced into a 2d side scroll instead of being able to just walk away you cant even with open space to your right and left. usually springs and dashpads remove all freedom of control you have to the point that its an auto played game where you ring dash, boost or homing attack. Its so basic that instead of making it harder they make it longer with no checkpoints. Take the second boss. Its a super long chase before the fight even starts then at the end there is a quick time event youve never seen before unless you fished. And on failing it you restart like 20 min prior over a quicktime event at the end.

Same issue with all the combat and bosses its difficulty from not falling asleep in a 30 min fight if anything. youre basically forced to buff up attack so that you dont waste 30 min chasing a squid because youre so slow and do so little damage you cant kill it fast enough. Then at the end of the game youre so fast and so strong you kill it almost instantly. Its not a fun balance. Its filled with chores. collectibles reset every island so there is no reason to overachieve early. Its just a mess",,
"Decent game but bad controls in a game about speed

Cons:
- Camera control by mouse is slow and blurry
- Menu control is weird (ESC does nothing)
- Cutscenes and scripted events interrupt you all the time!
- If you collect 400 rings for extra speed, get the same unskippable cutscene every time
- In battle, you cannot load saves, unless you go back to the title screen and then load the save
- Invisible walls in too many places
- There is no deceleration or feel of momentum, just immediate speed resets
- The jump button always resets your speed to almost zero
- Collect different items without learning what they are or do
- Combat is spamming left mouse
- Sonic cannot roll over the ground :(",,
"This is not a very fun or great game... And this is coming from a diehard sonic fan who has played nearly every game in the series, including 180 emblem sa2 many times.

Frontiers is a mess. It has zero consistency, doesn't do a good job explaining objectives well, or how to start doing them. If you rush through the first island you miss a lot of important information. Whatever main objective the game is asking you to do, it will bug you with a popup screen EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. that you die.

Sonics moment is ruined compared to his best (generations). He lacks any momentum and stops dead in his tracks, if you try and turn 180° he has to spin around and can't just turn the direction you want to face. His homing attack is accurate, but he takes too long to chain... feels jarring? Boosting stops if you bump into basically anything, and if you boost mid air you're stuck going that direction... If you fall in water you float EXTREMELY slow down and can't do anything until you hit the bottom, and by that time you run out of oxygen. Ugh

Homing attack is x again like unleashed, and light speed dash is LEFT STICK?!?!? WHY

The cyberspace levels feel AWFUL and it feels so janky. Sonic moves different from open world here and he feels like a cheap unpolished unreal engine game. The settings for sonics moment do NOT affect cyberspace so you're stuck with it. Spark 3 feels way more fluid then this, go play that.

It's very confusing to find how to get places sometimes because the platforms and rails don't pop in until you're really close. I have had many instances where I would be running around trying to figure out how to get to a island just to get extremely close to the edge and THEN platforms appear.

The ""normal"" enemies are super bothersome as you can't just attack them. You got to stop and cyloop them which kills motivation to fight. I understand if it is a special enemy but it's a common one.

During objectives, the game has no comprehension that you're doing anything and the camera likes to lock onto enemies you run next to, which interrupts you, WHY!!! I was doing a time trial and my camera locked into a ""shark"" and forced me into a boss fight I can't leave, WHILE THE TIME TRIAL IS STILL GOING ON IN THE BACKROUND!

The music player is the opposite button as one to show your main objective (Left/right dpad). The issue is if you change the music by mistake it's a one way trip, have sit there to cycle all the way back around. It's stuff like this that makes a game feel unpolished, whatever I'll let Seaside Hill play

I am currently at a cannon and it's telling me to shoot the chain with it, and it isn't working. I'm probably doing something wrong but I can't be bothered to continue and figure this games nonsense anymore. The entire time I have felt nothing but miserable and I can't keep going anymore.

I preordered the game and refunded it same day, I picked it up on the Holliday sale to try again and I heavily regret it. I wish I could refund it again. I love sonic and I never leave reviews for games on steam, but I haven't ever had this miserable of a time gaming.

I do like the soundtrack and it's amazing! The titan fights are cool I guess, even though it's just attack spam. It's a personal preference, but I don't click well with Rogers deeper voice for Sonic however I know others like it.",,

"I've been a Sonic fan since Sonic Adventure 1 and I can finally say I'm proud to be a Sonic fan again. Now this game isn't perfect, it has some flaws in areas, but nothing so outlandish that it ruins the experience like many past titles.

Combat is fun and fluid, exploration and map expansion is satisfying and the cyberspace stages honestly grew on me the more I played of them. They're very fun to speedrun.

The world, lore and story are the most fleshed out and interesting we've seen in a Sonic game in almost 2 decades. It's so nice to have a proper expansion on the lore the fandom holds so dear.

The music... Oh my god the music. Yes.

Really fantastic time. Definitely recommend.

Minor Semi-Spoiler:
--
The ending left a lot to be desired. It feels like they ran out of budget/time towards the end, but it's forgivable cause of just how fun the core experience is. Hopefully we'll get an expansion or DLC down the road or something. Would love that.",,
"While I may not have played every single Sonic game out there, I have played most of them (to include the lost Sonic the Hedgehog title featuring Princess Elise and Sonic Forces) and I must say SONIC FRONTIERS is one of the best if not THE best Sonic game I have played.

I have found myself quite satisfied running endlessly around the map collecting medals, emeralds, Koco, etc. And for the first time, I am not completely frustrated with the forced camera angles of past Sonic titles. The music also adds a nice touch, not overbearing but also doesn't make me wanna plug my ears either. Controls are very simple and straightforward, maybe a little too much as parrying attacks literally requires no skill.

In short, it's a great game. And if you're looking to 100% it, you won't be bored to tears while trying.",,
I have experienced Sonic like never before!,,

"I can't even really give a detailed review of why I love this game so much, it's just really damn fun. It's got a few problems, but nothing that's close to a major turn off. Highly recommend this game to just about anyone.",,
"Finishing the game took me 21 hours
When playing I felt that the team cared more for the quality and the whole vibe of the game. I had a great time playing Sonic Frontiers. As everyone says, this game delivers for the fans a nice more serious story, engaging battles and a feeling of speed.
However, I feel the developers where cautious when implementing open world gameplay into this game. Because I sometimes felt locked from building momentum and using it as a reward for being aware of the space. They did add some features of reward like the rail jumping. More of that would let players experiment more. In addition, the core design of levels being formed from mostly flying platforms is a bit weird. It could have took a bit of thinking to make it more natural and believable in the context of the sonic world. I do love running in the map and trying to do all the puzzles. All the cutscenes are amazing and the characters and story are well putted together.
In conclusion, the game is fantastic. This is a good direction for the modern sonic franchise, trying new and exiting thinks, and always delivering with the awasome music OMG THE MUSIC IS SO GOOD YES SEGA I NEED IT!
hope the dlc is good.
Of cource this game is miles better than forces, they really outdid there level design here.",,
New sonic with old the fun elements !!,,

This game is amazing. Already I'm amazed.,,
Janky ass controls (super sonic in particular is awful to contol) an poorly designed boss battles say this needs a fair bit mpre polish before it could be recommended,,
review,,
"Can't bother anymore. Game is incredibly barebones for what it's offering and Cyberspaces have almost zero variety in the case of areas. It's always Green Hill, Chemical Plant, Sky Sanctuary or Speed Highway (and they're all incredibly bland and SHORT which really sucks). It's like 2 generations behind in terms of graphics for a AAA game and objects popping in and out keeps on giving me brain damage.

The open world, while a very brilliant idea, is horribly executed as shown in the game. Physics are very clunky, and movement is nowhere as good as one would think it would be. Sometimes the game will force you to control Sonic with old-school 2D controls because you accidentally stumbled upon a medallion section in the world and you pretty much have to commit to it and waste like a minute or so just to complete it.

And speaking of medallions, you can't even progress with the game unless you collect enough of those (along with other stuff, but this is the worst part), which leads to the worst padding I've seen in an open world game, and this happens in EVERY section in the game. Some mini-bosses are also part of the game, but they do very little to progress the game and are generally time-consuming and boring. It's a boring grind-fest just to progress the game, which is definitely something you don't wanna do in a Sonic game.

The music is good, it's always been good. I don't think there's a single Sonic game that has bad music outside of Sonic Chronicles for the DS (and we all know why). And the actual boss fights for each region is actually really nice, so at least there's always a reason to progress, despite how agonizing it is.

This game is nowhere as good as people are claiming it to be, but it's FORTUNATELY an OKAY game at best. Sonic fans are starved for good Sonic games that they will see a game being better than Forces as a ""masterpiece"" (this goes out especially to you, Gamescage)",,
Solid Sonic game. There are flaws in this game that can show pretty easily but eh yknow this is a step in the right direction but man we do not need boost anymore please sega get rid of it :prey:,,
sigma balls,,
"Steam needs to add a Mixed review option. This is one of the rare cases where the game isn't great, but it's not awful, it's just.... okay

Unlike with previous Sonic Team endeavors, Frontiers is the first time I'm actually looking forward to the new formula. However, they need way more manpower for the next game cuz almost everything in Frontiers, be it the combat, the story or the controls, is unpolished

[CONTROLS]

Hands down the best Sonic has ever moved in 3D since SA1, and even then... the game doesn't seem to take advantage of that. In all mini-challenges, you never actually use Sonic's movement, it's just

Automatic dash pad > boost on a rail > home in to a spring > fly through a hoop > repeat

They all feel aimless. Just hovering platforms that offer a single memory token, once you get it, no reason to ever do these challenges again. Only time you will repeat them is by accident, if you forgot that you already finished a certain challenge. Don't get me started on those """"""puzzles"""""", they're insulting even to children

The cyberspace controls are a complete joke. They're terrible in 3D and are even worse in 2D, since they utilize the same physics as the open world, only difference is the air boost launches you upwards now, which I like

[COMBAT]

It ain't DMC that's for sure.... it ain't even Sonic Unleashed. Frontiers' combat mainly consists of glorified cutscenes that require you to press 2 button combinations. You don't actually juggle the enemies, you don't actually combo them, you just have a long window after each attack where you can activate another cutscene. It was cool at first but after a few hours you realize Sonic just.... shoots projectiles or spins the enemy, all while they don't even move, just stand in the exact same spot

Bosses are incredibly janky, animation-wise and the way you attack them. They are style over substance and there's BARELY any style due to how unpolished everything is, but I would lie if I said I didn't enjoy fighting them on my first playthrough

[STORY]

Let me be clear, I'm talking about the game's ACTUAL plot, not the character interactions. The characters in Frontiers are the best they've been since the days of Sonic X. As for the main story, after finishing the game, I honestly have no idea why they kept it a secret. It's the generic ""Lost civilization is dead, here's how it happened"" and the way they present it is so poor due to how this game was clearly made on a lower budget compared to your typical AAA game. That's also reflected in the cutscenes, which would either have the worst animation you've ever seen in a Sonic game, or the best, they're so inconsistent

[BUDGET]

Now, you REALLY don't have to be a genius to realize this game was rushed. And I mean RUSHED. Not 06-levels, but playing the game you start noticing a lot of things should've been more polished and just.... better

• The 4th and 5th island reuse the same grass theme of the 1st (they're literally called Kronos 2 and Kronos 3 in the game files)
• Whole 3rd island consist of nothing but 2D challenges that you can skip by just boost-jumping from a hill and grabbing the memory token, it's also the only island that has its flashback scene use 2D stills
• 4th island lasting 20 minutes, cuz it's just an interlude to the final 5th one
• Sonic getting corrupted goes nowhere cuz it gets resolved IN THE SAME CUTSCENE
• That pink-haired human from TailsTube everyone was speculating to be the voice in Sonic's head is absent
• Lackluster animations on bosses, combat, cutscenes, etc.
• Big's fishing mini-game where you fish for PSO2 New Genesis and Generations assets that clash with the game's art style
• No CG cutscenes yet again. Marza was hired to make those few trailer scenes just like with Forces and nothing more
• No customization whatsoever. You'd think after they made 374 gloves and shoes for the avatar in Forces, they'd reuse them for Frontiers and put them in those Eggman ships that're scattered across the islands but nope. Enjoy your SA2 shoes that're newsletter exclusive and your brown boots that're Digital Deluxe-exclusive
• The EXCESSIVE pop-in any developer nowadays should be ashamed of
• The final 4th titan is just the first one but recolored and given a rifle, even then he doesn't use it outside of a QTE
• Cyberspace reusing old levels, under the pretense of them being Sonic's memories makes gets thrown RIGHT out the window once you realize some levels are brand new and some are levels where you played as Shadow in OG games
• Cyberspace only having 4 themes (Green Hill, Chemical Plant, Sky Sanctuary and a hybrid between Speed Highway/Empire City) because god forbid they'd reuse more level themes like Crisis City or Planet Wisp
• The final boss and the main villain being..... nothing. No build-up, no backstory, the real villain is literally and figuratively nothing

Sonic Frontiers IS a step in a right direction for the series future, but it doesn't mean it's a game I'd recommend. To me, its vision doesn't seem all that clear, nor does it overall feel like a next-gen experience. It needs a lot of polishing and patches to make it truly good. I frankly don't see Sonic Team's development cycle changing anytime soon. You can bet the next game will be made primarily for Switch, released in November to get those holiday sales and mandatory prequel media like a comic and animation cuz that's easier to make than actual in-game cutscenes. If that happens yet again, count me out of this franchise",,

"After 100%ing everything, every time I could recall something that was fun I also remembered another handful of things that made it worse. Changes to boost were interesting and bringing back the spindash and drop dash was great. But getting the spindash and when and where you can use it just shows the rushed mess this game can be. Raised geometry in levels launching you to the sky, some degrees of running up slopes is okay, some just slide you off. Some enemies in the the overworld straight up yank the camera from you, even if you're in a challenge. And that brings the worst problem of them all, the camera.
Instead of giving Sonic free flowing movement, and making him acrobatic enough to actually platform with, you have to rely on jumping puzzles to get to some areas within the five islands you go to. Traversing the world and having the camera lock you into a 2D platforming puzzle you can't exit from without jumping away from the blocked invisible path is obnoxious.

Music is fine, the cyber space challenges are fine, some of the actual open world puzzles are fine, SOME of the bosses sucked ass (Caterpiller) but most of them were okay. Can't recommend with all my heart as a seasoned Sonic potato.

Play Sonic Adventure 1 or Spark the Jester instead.",,

"Sonic Frontiers didn't just live up to my hopes, but actually managed to exceed them in many areas.

The graphics are beautiful. Placing Sonic against this realistic world is a way to show that he is somewhat out of his element and in a brand new situation. Juxtapose that with the classically Sonic-esque cartoonish style of the Cyberspace levels, and the contrast really allows both to shine beautifully. There's a good amount of pop-in just due to the sheer speed, but it's honestly not TOO too noticeably when you're just zooming around in the open field. Some of the particles are a bit wonky and the water effects in the fishing mini-game are a bit broken, but overall those are pretty minor nitpicks.

The game play is natural and fluid. You're never really pausing to think of where to go next; You see something just on the edge of your field of view and you go there to investigate. These chain together and lead to very natural-feeling progression. Sometimes you want to head out in an entirely different direction, and the game rewards you with even more to explore and uncover. The ""open zone"" never feels empty. It feels like there's more to find over every hill. Sometimes the camera is a bit funny and jumps around when you're too close to cliff walls and the like. But otherwise, it's all good. Lots of options to tweak the camera too, if it's happening a bunch.

Sonic's momentum is great. His starting speed is honestly just right, and paired with the Boost mechanic it's even better. I truly think this is where the Boost side of the Sonic franchise has been heading all this time. It just feels so natural and intuitive. Being able to upgrade Sonic's speed is a huge plus. I'm excited to level it all the way up to 99. I do wish some of the combat moves had more applications outside of fighting, but that's another minor nitpick. Some things like the light speed dash (I think it's called) through coins can stop momentum if you're not careful, but again you can just get right back up to speed.

As far as other mechanics go, the collectibles are really enjoyable. Beating bosses is seriously intense and makes great use of the large levels and Sonic's top speed. You truly feel like you're taking on a formidable enemy each time. Replaying the Cyberspace levels is enjoyable and you have really solid goals to work towards. You'll definitely get better as time goes on, as long as you remember to use the Boost mechanic! I totally forgot about it until half an hour into the game and it helped so much.

Just watch out for Level 1-2. S rank is practically impossible on it and I have a feeling that might get patched since even the media had trouble with it. The rest of the levels so far, I've had no problem after a bit of practice.

The story so far is very mysterious and compelling. There are a few threads that get intertwined and I'm genuinely excited to see it through. However, you're not rushed in it. You're able to take your time and just explore as you see fit, after a certain point. I will say that I'm unsure at times why I'm interacting with Sage in the open field, but talking with her does give some unique characterization and bits of information about the world so I don't particularly mind it.

The music, as always, is one of the best parts of the game. They really knocked it out of the park not only with the composition, but also with the cues for when music plays, fades in or out, and changes. It's a huge soundtrack and I don't think I've even scratched the surface so far. Really no complaints about it at all.

Overall, Sonic Frontiers is a really fresh take on the franchise that I think many people will enjoy. It's not a perfect game, but I have enjoyed my time with it so far. I definitely recommend you give it a try! I'm just under 5 hours in and I'm not even halfway done with the first island. Hope that gives you an idea of the length.",,

"this is the best sonic game I've ever played. i have been a fan since the first Sonic Adventures on the Dreamcast and this games amazing and something i wanted since i was a kid. so far no problems except when doing Sonic Boom near walls the camera tends to clip into the wall and you can't see anything but its rare that you use it near a wall. Other than that amazed at the quality and the voice acting is really good match's the characters perfectly. overall an amazing sonic game and i'd call this a masterpiece of a sonic game!

Also the music and sounds are amazing!",,
"honestly not bad for an open zone sonic game. so far the plus sides are the music and level layouts and styles, and the fact you can upgrade stats. i do like the open area to run around in but for as much as there is to do it still feels kinda empty. you need to collect stuff to upgrade and advance the storyline, of which is honestly pretty bland. and if you pre ordered the game then congrats you will be overpowered once you find the hermit. long story short is that yes the game is good but honestly a little disappointing. boss fights last 5 min or 5 seconds, zones last under 1 min sometimes a little longer, puzzels are pretty easy, and after 6 hrs i can run across the map in about a min with boost. and the 6 hrs is just the first open zone im guessing? mostly collecting things.",,
"I was hoping that this would be the return of Sonic, but it's really not, as much as fans would have you believe it is.

Open Zones
The open zone gameplay is riddled with janky moments, and the only times where it plays smoothly is when you're running on perfectly flat ground, or you touch a spring/boost pad and the game essentially plays itself for about 15 seconds. The first zone has some polish, but as you progress you can feel the decrease in development time, especially in the third zone. Maneuvering sonic in the air is terrible since you lose all of your momentum when you jump, you move too slow without boosting, and too fast when boosting, not to mention the generally awkward physics. The open areas also have the problem of looking incredibly dull, littered with random floating obstacles that all look the same no matter which zone you're in. Some of these obstacles even force you into a 2D perspective, which is terrible because you retain the same physics as 3D and you can't turn around instantly as you can in 2D games, leading to some of the worst controls I've experienced. Unfortunately, these open zones are the best the game has to offer.

Somehow making the open areas feel even duller, the linear stages actually look very vibrant and colorful. However, these stages play worse than any other part of the game because of worse physics as well as worse controls thanks to the forced camera perspectives that make navigating Sonic a nightmare. Trying to 'go fast' by using the boost will often send you flying off into the bottomless pit surrounding every level. Luckily they made it incredibly easy to get an S rank time so it's over somewhat quickly.

Out of all the open zone bosses, there are one or two that were decently fun to fight, but the vast majority are repetitive and uninteresting if they manage to work correctly at all. Titan bosses, which are placed at the end of each zone, are more of a mixed bag. The first one is pretty good for how basic the combat is, and the soundtrack is at its best here. The second titan, unlike the first and third, does not let you move freely and is entirely on rails, meaning the entire fight just comes down to holding the parry button while watching to boss do the same animation over and over again for 5 minutes.

""So that was a thing."" - Sonic
That is actual dialogue from the game. I think that's all that needs to be said.

This game lets you run around an open area, really fast, as Sonic. If that's all it takes for you to think this game is good, then you are like most die-hard Sonic fans who review this game positively. However, I would've liked the game to be finished, with smooth and consistent controls, and a map that doesn't look like a Halo forge world made by a 10-year-old. The soundtrack is good, some boss fights are OK, and the rest of the game is mid or worse. The Sonic community is very excited because this game is better than most other 3D sonic games, but don't let the hype fool you.",,
"One of the best platformers of the last decade, without a doubt. Possibly THE best. The variety and fluidity of the gameplay is so good that I can overlook some occasionally clunky controls and really bad pop-ins/draw-distance.",,

"I've only just dipped my toes into this game, but I can already tell it's something special. It's been a very long time since a Sonic game made me this happy.

After quite a long time, I finally remember why I enjoyed playing Sonic games. A colorful cast of characters, beautiful environments, and high-speed gameplay that tests my reflexes.

Is it a perfect game? No. However, don't let that discourage you from trying this out. Frontiers brims with love and care that the previous few releases from Sonic Team lacked. I pray they stick to their guns this time and keep the foundations they've built in this game.",,

"while its great graphics and a fun playstyle, its honestly not worth it.
i tried to get into this game, persevered even (10.5 hours) but once i got to the third island, i couldnt take it anymore. while the story has some good aspects, sonic forces felt more interesting than this. its very repetetive, i love the open world aspect but in every island, you just collect an insane amount of items which takes a long time, and in the middle of that you have cutscenes every minute. if you find one of the bosses, it triggers an annoying cutscene which then makes you try to fight the boss. also, super sonic mode felt difficult and confusing to play at times and that was repetitive too (surprising)
----------------------------------------------------
after completing the game, i have some reccomendations to make your experience more interesting.
as some have pointed out already, the physics in this game are difficult to handle and to fix this problem i installed the Tracker's Physics Tweaks mod, which paired with the Enhanced Moveset mod made my experience with collecting and achieving things wayyy better. i also highly recommend the No Cutscenes After Challenges mod, as when you complete a challenge, this longgg process of showing the map, the scan, etc can make it unmotivating to fill the map in, and using this mod sped it up and motivated me to actually explore more. there's also cosmetic mods, such as changes sonic's character, and i found that the sonic unleashed model added more depth and liveliness to his character. finally, once i'd finished the game, i downloaded the mod that made me able to become super sonic in the open world and cyberspace areas, which was also useful when i started New game + to help me get around the map.
overall, its an okay game. a lot funner with mods!

changed my review back to negative because of the final horizon update that ♥♥♥♥ is horrendous",,

I don't have this Knuckles profile pic for nothing. This game is bringing him back. Buy it.,,
Just beautiful,,
I feel obligated to leave a review for any game that's fun enough for me to get all the achievements in. A must play,,
"Sonic Frontiers is by far one of the best Sonic games in the franchise! It is easily one of my favourite platformers, and is probably my game of the year for 2022. The gameplay is phenomenal! The characters have been written to have meaningful personalities. And the mystery surrounding the starfall islands is one that I enjoyed every second of!

However, there were a few bits that annoyed me. I won't spoil anything, but just know that the flaws I will mention are incredibly specific. Firstly, the only cyberspace level I didn't enjoy was the one that had drifting. It felt clunky, and unpolished, and I wish they had just put effort into making an actual level in place of it. Secondly, the pinball machine. WHY IS THERE A PINBALL MACHINE? Perhaps it would have been fun, had it not been such a bland and symmetrical design, with a ridiculously high score to aim for, but I guess I can overlook that considering how quickly you can beat it. Finally, the final boss seemed incredibly underwhelming. I know we already got a boss fight immediately before that, which seemingly fulfilled by desires for a final boss, but I'm still annoyed that the final boss was based around a gimmick.

But considering how expansive the full game is, these are really just nitpicks. I loved the game, and I'll definitely be going out of my way to 100% it. SEGA needs to make sure that they keep Ian Flynn as the writer for future games, because this is a massive step in the right direction. I can't wait until the next game rolls around, no matter how long it takes! Keep up the good word SEGA!",,

After the DLC I want to put a review in between but we only have thumbs up/down. Most annoying was trials, bosses, and the stupid auto-lock",,
Pretty solid. A bit janky in some places but a fun time through and through.,,
jank,,
"Don't be fooled by the mostly positive reviews under this game.
The combat is dull and repetitive. you pretty much mash x until you can go into one of your special moves. (I recommend getting combat mods to make this game somewhat enjoyable)
The islands: A lot of the exploration is just gonna be the game playing itself instead of you actually exploring also the game over uses rails and 2d sections to make up for how boring it is to explore.
The boost stages are even worse then Forces now being extremely short and control like ♥♥♥♥.
the only highlight for this game honestly is The Super Sonic boss fights but at there still extremely lacking as you will be mashing the attack button or just waiting to parry.",,
Boring,,
"Good gameplay
Good soundtrack
Good story
Yeah id say its a pretty good game!",,
/,,
guud gaam,,
More games like this and less like Forces please thank you!,,
"The individual levels are fun, the open world is probably the worst part of the game. Generally reminiscent of Sonic Unleashed.",,
"Want to like this game, but sadly it runs like crap.

Runs locked 60fps on an rtx 3050 and i7-6950x, until you fall off the stage once, then it locks itself to 15fps? Why?

Restarting the game fixes it, sometimes alt+tab to something else for a few minutes and coming back does so. Thing is, it doesn't ""work"" half the time and runs like crap.",,
"EDIT: With my refunded money I bought Sonic Adventure 2 and Spiderman: Miles Morales. This game is worse than either, let alone both for the same price.

So, look--I'm not a Sonic fanboy, but I grew up playing S3 and SA:DX on Gamecube, so I like Sonic games and this isn't me being a hater. But I'm going to review it objectively and not 'as a Sonic game' or compare it to any recent worse games in the franchise. I guess this makes my review geared more toward the broader audience vs people that really love the franchise because they probably already own the game.

I wanted to enjoy it because it sounded really cool but I just didn't.

The good:

It's interesting. It's a different take on a Sonic game and sometimes it felt pretty cool to play. I like the cyloop idea a lot. The OST is nice. In game visuals are not amazing but they look pretty nice most of the time. Giant bosses are always fun and add scale to a game. Digital world levels looked really nice.

Mediocre:

It feels....hollow. Combat is mashing a button with a little cyloop action, though I feel like sometimes even that didn't register all the time. You kind of run from place to place, grind a couple rails, hit some rings...the digital world levels were really detailed and fun but few and far in between and VERY short, like a minute each maybe (and they blow by really fast). I don't know, it just doesn't feel like a finished game.

It also just has a really weird feel to it. You've got 'realistically' modeled sprawling landscape and a cartoon hedgehog running around on floating rails collecting rings with some rain and somber background music. Giant titan bosses. 3D but linear sub-levels you get into through thrones. A skill system with only a handful of skills in it. It felt like it wanted to be 2 different kinds of game but never really landed on either successfully.

On Hard mode, it felt really easy, outside of things that felt janky, like hitting an Asura's weird spike thing while above the lasers but taking damage from it anyway, or a boost canceling momentum in the middle of a high-speed event. Puzzles were pretty simple, at least early on.

Something feels weird about the movement. I can't explain it well but it's like you start moving really fast and stop very suddenly over weird things like dashing or boosting. Kind of had a jerky feel to it rather than the kind of built up acceleration you normally get from Sonic games; maybe a better way to describe it would be that other Sonic games feel momentum based whereas this one you just hit boost and gotta go fast.

Bad:

The frame rate is capped at 60FPS and cutscenes are not only 30FPS but they look like garbage, I think they're 1080p and it's like they pre-recorded them on low or something. I have a 4k monitor and they look awful.

So many cutscenes and pop-ups. I don't need to see the same cutscene every time I perform an action. They're skippable but...it's so unnecessary.

First couple of mini games were really boring and felt like a waste of time.

I keep seeing people talking about the writing/acting being good but like...they aren't. They never really were imo, but Sonic was never about the story for me. I think having this gritty BotW-esque presentation made the performances stand out because previous games were definitely worse, but they were lovable cartoon silliness and it wasn't weird.

I'm refunding and will probably check it out later after some updates on a sale. I think at 60 it seems way too hollow. I got 3 chaos emeralds in like an hour and a half and that was with me redoing stuff and trying extra overworld options.",,
"Hearing plenty of mixed opinions on Sonic Frontiers and hearing parts of the soundtrack myself made me want to check the game out.

As a quick summary, I would say that people who grew up with the early 2000's sonics as their main sonic games will be happy and at home in Frontiers, but that also comes with some of the jank they would expect. As a result, while I'm missing experience with newer Sonic games, newer fans that aren't as used to something like flying off into the abyss on accident may not be so pleased.

The open world aspect is accompanied with basically snippets of sonic levels, like rails leading to a couple bounce pads that get you an item you need to collect 180 of. Those levels snippets can want you to commit though, as if you bump into them while exploring you might get locked onto the railing and have to find a way off if you want to get back to what you were doing. Also I said 180, and that sounds like a lot, but those items are farmable through luck, enemies, and even Big the Cat's fishing minigame. With Big, you can outright skip collection and even the actual levels of the game if you devote some time to it.

Part of the collection mechanic is that you need to do actual sonic levels to progress. All of these sonic levels are the more well known fast paced action Sonic players should expect, with some familiar terrains and even bgm styles as a throwback to longtime fans. These are easily the most fun parts of the game, with some S-ranks requiring some pretty solid gameplay skill or practice to achieve. Some of them, namely the ones that are more 2D, had some annoying parts for me, but that might just be due to mostly playing 3D sonics.

Back on exploration, there are sidequests that are tied to your collectathon. While talking with characters is also part of the story and you need to do them to progress, some of them are optional and are either pleasant conversations or just lore dumping. One catch to these is that they're tied to their island in terms of the story, meaning you may have already found Tails later in the game, only to come back to an earlier sidequest conversation and Sonic will act like he hasn't seen him. Not terrible, just a bit jarring.

As for some things that feel like they don't belong, a good example is the pre-boss puzzles. These are mostly harmless, the first one is a surprisingly hard laser puzzle, but the second is just a crane game. These are easy enough. The third however is a pinball game with a miserably high score requirement. While you can increase your score multiplier within the game, losing a ball will set it back to normal. This might seem like a really strange gripe but this is unironically my biggest complaint with this game. I cleared the score requirement twice but lost my last ball both times before the final clear. The game eventually shows mercy on you with some bumpers to save you but I was already malding.

The bosses are all pretty fun presentations and cool looking, with absolutely stellar bgm as sonic fans should expect. However, early on when you haven't increased your attack power, the first boss in particular can feel rough. If you enter with less than 100 rings, you're given 100, but I needed at least 200 for an ample amount of time to clear. Later on however I was able to deal 60% of an hp bar with a single counter so it feels all over the place. Additionally, the fights all seem to revolve around you using the ""parry"" ability, which can be held indefinitely and requires no timing. It's not the worst thing to revolve your fights around a simple mechanic but it feels kind of silly to just sit there waiting to get hit.

It would be a disservice to anyone reading this if I didn't mention that there's bonus content going into the end with the game set to hard, which can be done at any time, because if you don't do this you're in for something pretty anticlimactic (and honestly it kind of feels like an anticlimax to me anyway but that's just me).

Overall I would say that Sonic Frontiers is pretty good. Story is uhhhhhh ok. Game has a bit of scuff but I'm used to that through my personal adventures with the franchise. That doesn't mean I didn't run into things that were frustrating, but rather that the good times blitzing through levels for S-rank and bashing bosses in big hot-blooded action mixed with killer music overwhelmed those parts. Mostly. If you're desperate for some sonic action or want to see for yourself if the game is good, go ahead and get it, but otherwise wait for a sale.",,
add sonic sex,,
Some of the most fun I've ever had on a sonic game,,
"game feels clunky, mechanics dont always make sense, it throws you around without real sense of purpose and just ends up being more like watching a series of cutscenes of sonic going on rails, riding boosters etc.",,
I grabbed this game because the reviews said this is the best Sonic game for a long time. Those previous games must have been pretty awful.,,
Super repetitivo. Se cae a pedazos mal,,
"Product received for free

One of the most enjoyable sonic game of the modern era, you can spent hours just running and it feels great, and fun , definitely a game for sonic fans",,
"HERE WE.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
GO!",,
"Best 3D Sonic game since Unleashed! The dialogue is engaging, the boss fights are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hype, and free roam sonic is more fun than you think! Couple glitches and a few questionable animations that do not subtract from the experience! Would recommend!",,
"you guys can copy breath of the wild, but not your old previous work?

all you gotta do is make another great game Like SA2 with an updated chao garden

also gimmick puzzles needed to progress story are ruining the experience for players that just want speed

---

This game has way too many things that kill pace, such as repetitive cutscenes
not to mention no level select menu to play courses faster that having to locate them on the world maps

also every small level is just named 1-1,1-2,1-3 WHICH is stupidly confusing when trying to go back to want to replay a level after a few months. I was interested in replaying the level that looked like SKY RAIL from SA2 but couldn't find it after popping into 5 levels

the fact levels dont even have names shows how much effort went into the game. the idea of the game is cool, but people love Sonic adventures and boost games for a reason, they are fun and fast, cut scenes take like 1 frame to skip",,
This game was a gift from a friend so it feels bad to ♥♥♥♥ on it. But here I am. Be warned there is no Roll attack in this game. There is a slide which is trash and not sonic. Without a roll attack I do not feel like sonic. I feel like a super fast mario which sucks. There are mods that correct this mistake and to me that is a god send.,,
its fine,,
the dlc controlls and bosses are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥,,
BETTER THAN ELNED RIGN??!?!?!?!?!!!11111,,
"I have not played much of this game. The little I have played, I did not enjoy. This game is glitchy and laggy (my computer, as well as all my other games, do not glitch or lag), the graphics are a little messy, the story is not easy to follow, and the voice acting is subpar compared to other games in this series. I am willing to give this game another chance later, but for now, I can't bring myself to recommend this game to others. Again, I am only basing this review off the little I have played.",,
"Sonic frontiers is one of those games that is regarded as a good foundation for a game with some poor implementation.

It's one of those types of games where it doesn't feel right. But at the same time your inner masochist will allow you to see past the negatives.
The thing everyone is saying about the assets popping in at a weird distance making it a little jarring.
The starting setting of movement where Sonic is literally walking on ice... (When you don't change the settings).
The settings menu requiring an extra input to use the menu.
The lag between each interaction with each NPC.
The game has blur on by default (turn that off to deal with that issue)

I've played a ton of sonic games over years. But wouldn't call myself a sonic fan.
Now to summarise the story without massive spoilers.
Eggman places an AI device on one of the guardian plinths.
AI wants to protect Eggman from danger so traps him into cyberspace.
Sonic escapes the world of Cyberspace and then fights the AI enemies.
He gets chaos emeralds and fights a boss at the end.

You get more interactions and lore as you play through the game.
Giving you more questions than answers.

Do i recommend purchasing it at the current price?
Unfortunately, no.
If it becomes about half the current price though...
I might reconsider.",,
"I give the story 4 out of 5. Probably would be higher if I understood all of the lore references.
Game play gets 3 out of 5. pretty straight forward. The open world concept was a nice attempt but too often the game forces the player into a side scrolling plat former. Plus, in addition to the very repetitive level up options, i maxed out my speed but didn't notice any actual increase in speed.
Difficulty 2/5. I found the game to be relatively easy. I beat it with all achievements in only 27 hours. I found the skill progression very short as well. I had unlocked all the moves by the second island and was left with over 200 unusable skill points at the end.
Overall, this game was not worth the $60 I spent on it. (including the amy's treasure DLC)",,
"Sonic fans need standards and Sonic Team needs a new job.

I should've expected the Overwhelmingly Positive reviews were misleading, after Sonic Forces wasn't lambasted *enough*, but alas, wishful thinking makes fools of us all. This particular fool is now also poor, buying this so close to launch.

Yes, Sonic Team, it's great it took you over a decade to find a new working formula for Sonic. Yes, it is hilarious that it's based on Legend of Zelda. Yes, exploration with Sonic's move set does sound fantastic, just look at Sunset Overdrive.

But no, Sonic Team, still having the same basic problems with camera and movement that date back to Sonic Adventure, only this time without the level design to compensate, is not great. On top of that, the amount of jank in this is actually astonishing. I mean, I haven't run into any hard crashes or real performance issues, but anything from hit detection to homing locking properly to Sonic landing where he's supposed, or the abysmal air control or the physics or Sonic's moment coming to a halt all of a sudden is at the mercy of the gods.

Do not, absolutely, positively, definitely do not pay full price for this. Do not keep rewarding SEGA's dead-end thinking or Sonic Team's jank. Wait for a price drop; a sharp one.",,
"One of the absolute best Sonic games.

"I'm gonna keep it real simple.

The main game absolutely wonderful, the story, the characters, bosses, etc
It was better than i anticipated. Would Recommend it to everyone. However...

Final Horizon Update DLC:
Sonic Team can eat a double decker #### for all i care.
My advice, get you're parring game up bro..
Literally...
Until the patch their mess, i'll change my review.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is an amazing Sonic experience that deserves to be played. Its level design, concepts, and open world game play make it a truly unique experience. However, when I first purchased this game, my Windows 11 computer couldn't handle this game, even after turning all of the graphics to their lowest quality. Compare this to Final Fantasy VII Remake, which I have also played, which has modern graphics way better than this, and that game was at least able to run without input lag. I would highly recommend buying this on a gaming console instead.",,
"OST is heat, Especially the Knight boss fight.",,
fast,,
im using this as practice for my wife,,
i've only completed the first island boss and this is already well worth my money and time,,
actually pretty good,,
sonic hedgehog,,
Sonic frontiers is a good example how a 3D sonic game should be made and they should continue making sonic games in a formula that works and make sure to release a product that is finished and when its ready which is one of the reasons this game is good.,,
Finally. Sonic is back. My blue boy is fast again. Ian Flynn is truly a godsend when it comes to the sonic franchise and this is such a good game to make that point to be honest. Anyone calling it mid has probably never had fun in their life tbh and it shows. This game is so good I couldn't put it down. I truly feel like sonic is back,,
"I'll give an updated review when I finish the game. I'm 9 hours in so far and I gotta say, I'm kind of surprised by how enjoyable the game considering how it looked in early and even current previews.

There is a quite a bit of jank, and I am seriously hoping that Sonic Team gives this game the patches that it needs. I don't want this to be another case of a game getting abandoned after receiving only a couple small updates. If there are no updates to fix these issue, I think the modding scene will swoop in since there is already Hedge Mod Manager support for this game, and there is even a few codes available that fix some of the pace-breaking aspects. I'm confident more are on the way, so I would keep an eye on that.

I feel like this game is comprised of components that individually are not all that deep, but when woven together creates a fast, satisfying, and addictive gameplay loop.

Once again I'll try to be more specific with everything in an updated review. But so far, game is pretty enjoyable even if it could be much much better.",,
"The camera lock ruined this game for me. I can't tell you how many times I fell off the edge because I can't tell where to dash too in order to save myself. One of the most tedious plateformers I've played in a while. Story is boring and sucks. I skip cut scenes. So, much stuttering and frame rate drops. Map bugs constantly, you sit there jamming m or map on controller out of combat for minutes. Why does chaos island have very few fast travel points, it's one of the more tedious maps so why???? Mechanics are very unreliable, I've gone through grapple points to my death many time even though I prompted correctly. Mechanics as a whole are inconsistent at best. I hope the management of this game never work again in this field. **** your mini game pin ball cancer, ********. Maybe at least make the controllers work, I press forward it goes down. Did you even test this game, wtf. How is this game scored so high, yeeks.",,
10/10,,
Good game,,
"Probably one of the worst games i have ever played. Only bought it cause i heard the music first.

Janky animation. Terrible camera. Movement is terrible. It switches from fluid to static camera. I regret buying this game so much. Wish i could refund because i thought if i kept playing maybe i just had to get used to it. But no its still terrible. Also enemies constantly armor themself up. NORMAL ENEMIES so you have to do the annoying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ loop around them.

Worst designed game i have ever played. Some enemies are just impossible not get hit by. Also first boss fight if you dont have enough coins you will just run out of coins and lose the fight. Like what kind of design is that? My god never has singleplayer frustrated me more than this.

Also running and climbing walls horrible design aswell. Camera while gliding stuff is static sometimes and sometimes not which makes it messy.

Its visually a stunning game and the music is great but gameplay. HORRIBLE DO NOT RECOMMEND. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.",,
"This game has the best character ever made by SEGA, his name is Sonic The Hedgehog. He is a character that i have followed for my entire life, I have seen all the episodes ever made unless there are more, I have 1/4 of the many sonic comics out there and i want them all. I have played some of the other sonic games, and my all time favorite game besides this game is Sonic 06. Others say that 06 is the worst game ever but my opinion I loved that game. I used to own it and i have 100's of hours in that game. It was fun to just run around in the open world and talk to AI or kill different robots. It was a great time for me personally. I wish i still had that game. This game however is also a favorite of mine, it has the open world adventures, the coin collection, the robot fighting, newer robots that have never been in any other games and much more. If you wanted to see the ""much more"" part you would have to get it and find out yourself, id rather not spoil it for you.",,
yes,,
yes,,
sgood,,
yes,,
please do not buy this game :o,,
,,
I really bought this game thinking i would have a good time. This game was such a chore to get through. Completed it anyway for the easy 100%. The bosses and the music are the only good things that this game has.,,

"Achievements review:
★☆☆☆☆ The most grinding achievements in the Sonic’s series

For all achievements you need to solve all the challenges, listen all dialogues, upgrade all the skills and characteristics. puzzles - simple, skills farmed during the game, characteristics are fast farmed in fishing stages, and “pieces of memory” you really need to grind in the open world and for each character separately. The last boss opens only on hard difficulty, but you can change difficult before the last battle.

Game review:
★☆☆☆☆ When Prince of Persia 2008 met Sonic the Hedgehog 2006

- It's not Zelda. Only those who never played in Zelda, can say that. IMAO looks like a Microsoft Train simulator, because you will be on the rails at 90% of the play time. This is the slowest Sonic's game ever, and ""boost"" here doesn't help for him. And because of this you always will be used rails or boost platform.
- Graphics looks very bad, worse than on PS3 and the drawing distance is critically low - platforms and my lovelly rails just spawns in the air.
- At the same time, open world locations disigned like demo levels from UE: only grass and mountains and nothing else. And the “speed” levels have only 4 “visial theme”: Green hill, Chemical plant, Sky sanctuary and some kind of City Escape, but in fact in all game you will play around 30 speed levels.
- Performance is very poor. FPS critically falling down when you see water surfaces and the blinking of shadows with an unlocked or 60FPS on Steam deck.
- There are many bugs... Sonic grabs where it shouldn't and doesn't grab where it should, falls through the floor, a boost mechanic that allows you to run vertically by the mountains, poor auto-aim (worse when ever before ) and the biggest problem is buggy not a controllable camera, worse then in Adventure 2.
- All combat system is unnecessary. Any enemies are very easy to beat with a classical Homing Attack on any difficult. In trailer battles looks like Souls experients, but in real it’s very poor looking, when you smashing attack button and don’t understaind what going on there because of broken camera. You open all skills for 30% of the game and after that exp points just will be accumulate. After end I had accumulated about +250 experience points, which have nowhere to go.
- Absolutely useless leveluping: 99 levels for 4 different abilities which don't affect anything. To understand the difference between level 1 and 99 you have to look it up that on YouTube. It's also the grinding part of the game.
- The fishing stage is very boring one-button mini-game with which you can use abuse your abillity leveluping.
- The story is finally serious. The characters no longer look like idiots and it’s grate. But in the end the plot tells nothing and leads to nothing. All the dialogues between the characters are empty and extremely uninteresting. Game trying to combine all the previous stories, but because of this, generate more questions in that you have no one answers.
- One great thing int the game is the soundtrack. All compositions are great, and ambient tracks from open world and voice compositions with a vocalist from “Sleeping with Sirens”. I’m waiting OST CD’s release in December.",,
"goes hard, might make a more elaborate review later but like you should buy it in the mean time lol",,
"10/10
I was skeptical at first being an early 2000's Sonic fan.
But I will reassure you. That the Sonic you grew up with in the 2000's is back, not only his character, but the ambition of adventure he's taking on. Aesthetically and story-driven wise.

This IS the best Sonic Game that was ever made. This game has very MINOR issues and are overshadowed by the amazing creative and love Sonic Team has put into this game.
The videos online do not do this game justice, you must simply play yourself, as the controls are tight and response and fluid.

This game blows Mario Odyssey and Breath of the Wild out of the water and sets a new bar for open world games as this one takes crown.

What made me cry was not ONLY the end, but also how long I have waited for the real Sonic to return.
Do not rely on reviews, play games yourself for your personal input as it's different for every player.",,
"Haven't enjoyed a Sonic game like this for a very long time. Everything feels great. It's one of the better feeling 3d Sonic Games in a very long time. The graphics could be better but the art direction makes the whole game look great even if the textures can be pretty low res at times. The combat feels satisfying, although so far I don't know how deep it is. The open world section is not the deepest open world ever created but it looks nice, is fun to explore, and has a good few big enemies that are fun to fight. The real Sonic Meat(please don't google that) comes from the cyberspace levels, which are your standard, traditional fast paced tracks. Which are enjoyable as always and only improved by the gameplay improvements that Sonic Team have made overall.(Homing attack feels better than it ever has)

A lot of people wanted this game to fail, but I can say as a semi-lapsed Sonic fan, this game so far is definitely solid enough to enjoy and leaves me excited for the future of Sonic games.

I'm still not making a Sonic OC though.",,
"I love it.Some say it's not too good some say it's ok but I think it's great.It has flaws like every game ever created but overall it's good. Good story, decent control (takes some getting used to but once you do it's so nice), amazing graphics with the exception of some cutscenes clearly being converted a little bit.Overall I am so happy this game is the way it is and it was worth the wait, worth the delay in 2021, worth the hype, worth the sobbing of IGN being a horrible company, and I even bought it twice for both my ps5 and my pc since I have a steam deck and would adore to take this sonic story on the go.

100% reccomend.
Pls sega....don't give up on this format and improve on the little flaws it has",,
"It looked interesting at first but it's just another speed-boost game with member berries thrown in to pretend that it's any good when I'd rather play the games that are referenced.

The design is so far detatched from the Sonic franchise that Sonic and friends can be replaced by grey blobs and nothing will be different. This is not a Sonic game, it's a game with Sonic in it.

The levels are more member berries recycled from Generations (which is 10% more fun than this game) with all the fun and personality stripped away from them. I hated these levels as they're so boring with terrible club music put over it. The glitchy, tech effects in the levels make the worlds feel so disjointed and non-existent in the grand scheme of things, going through said levels feels like a major waste of my time but I HAVE to do it and get all the dang points if I want to move on (begrudgingly, mind you).

And what's even the point of Sonic's friends being made into holograms when you can still see them across the land as if they're not trapped at all, it's so weird and feels like they're not really there (haven't got far enough to know why they're trapped) but why can't they just be there in person if their holograms won't restrict them from communicating with Sonic in the first place?
And I hope that damn hologram girl gets forgotten, she's so 2D and boring. She could get ripped to shreds in a really violent manner and I couldn't care less about her supposed significance to the story. Sonic helping her in the overworld is so forced, I don't believe Sonic would actually care about her. That character, who's name I don't have enough respect to look up her name, she could disappear and the only thing that would change would be my mood and story improving.

Rainbow points: Amy keeps referring to a mother character and using they/them instead of feminine pronouns, the conversation sounds like Amy is being threatened at gun-point by activists to be inclusive or DIE. It's such an unnatural conversation and feels like it's tacked on top last minute to avoid butthurt from Rainbow Activists that don't even play games to begin with.
If there's more Rainbow Points, I've let this game escape my memory so I can use the brain space for something more useful like ""A bird flew by my window today"".

Also please keep Ian Flynn this is the best written sonic story of all time, my only gripe with it is that due to the structure of the game secondary characters like Amy, Knuckles, and Tails feel very inactive. You see them talk about growth and change in many different ways but they don't take action in that direction. it'd be nice to see that growth in action during future titles.",,

"I feel like an alpha tester, and I'm pretty sure Sega tried to harvest my email address by offering me the shoes Sonic should have been wearing in the base game as a sketchy limited time offer DLC.

Now for the obligatory Sonic fan part:
11/10 Best 3d Sonic game since Adventure 2!

"Best Sonic Team game since Generations.

Gameplay - 4/5 - sometimes the jank makes this game feel like it was a fan made unity game, but it was still fun to control Sonic and I'm hoping SEGA made enough to give the devs a better budget for the next game to buff out these problems

Soundtrack - 6/5 this is the games shining star

Story - 2/5 - didn't care for Sage or the store brand Koroks

Level Design - 3/5, they were too short IMO. Some levels you can complete in 30 seconds without trying, but they are fun while they last

Open world - 3/5 - fun to run around, but field bosses and memory tokens quickly become a chore

Mini games - 1/5 - they suck and IMO makes Frontiers feel like it doesn't know what kind of game it wants to be. The pinball minigame especially should never have been developed. This is excluding Bigs fishing mini game

Bigs Fishing Mini Game - 6/5 this is the games other shining star",,

There are a lot of questionable game design decisions that feel straight out of the early 2000s. For example:

There are some short, classic 3d style levels in this game. They're designed well enough, but if you want to retry the level while playing it, you have to wait 2-3 seconds at a minimum before GETTING to watching a short cutscene that leads into the level, usually another 2-3 seconds. If you want to retry the level after you've finished it, you have to wait for a 5 second series of animations showing your score to go by before seeing that same 2-3 intro cutscene again.

Bosses drop gears that are necessary to progressing the story. You have to manually walk over to pick them up. There are items in the game that already automatically pick themselves up once you unearth them, or activate a switch, or whatever. Why don't the gears do that?

you can change your starting speed and maximum speed in the menu. Why??? Why didn't the game designers design the world and levels around one, satisfying to use speed?

These decisions damper the experience, but they're not the thing which makes want to drop the game. That thing is the fact that Sonic doesn't feel good to control.",,
"The Deluxe Edition is a bloody false advertising. You can only access the digital artbook and soundtrack via in-game only. If you want to buy the game, do not buy the digital deluxe edition, waste of money.

Refunding the game due to bloody false advertising.",,
"Tl;dr: Tries and fails to be Sonic's version of Breath of the Wild. Quality of life updates would make the game okay, but it is a slog in its current state. Not worth the current price.

Let me start with the good: the story/writing is decent and is by far the best thing in this game (I think one of the IDW Sonic writers did work for this game, and it shows). A couple of the titan and giant enemy designs were interesting and well done (I sense some influence from Neon Genesis Evangelion in a few of them). The special combat move animations are awesome in a vacuum. Some of the longer platforming parts have checkpoints and shortcuts, which is great if you happen to fall off some massive aerial structure. The map discovery system was an interesting mechanic that I wish was fleshed out a bit more. 2B is in this game (not really, but the main antagonist definitely looks and acts the part). I appreciate the relative open-endedness of the objectives (you can play worlds in just about any order, or even not play them and still reach the objective with time)

It took me about 21 and a half hours of in-game time to get all of the achievements. About 1 hour of that time was probably spent repeatedly sitting through Elder Koco's level up dialogue. It is amazing how they did the Hermit correctly (he takes all of your items at once and gives you levels in return), yet they decided that the Elder had to be done one by one. There is a noticeable delay in just about all menuing in this game, which is incredibly frustrating, especially when you will end up going though that dialogue 198 times over the course of the game. I am surprised that there is no bulk buy/exchange option in a game where every single currency is a multitude of collectible items. Also, fishing cutscenes are unskippable, and you must watch the numbers count up before you are allowed to continue.

The final fight is incredibly lack luster, to the point where I actually thought the game was unfinished. Seriously it's that bad.

The main loop of this game (solve puzzles to get collectible A; complete portals to get collectible B; get enough of A and B to get to the next boss/island) doesn't change at all throughout the story. I had all skills unlocked after the 3rd world, and there is no real new game plus (there is a time attack mode as a reward for completing the story, which is the exact same worlds as the main game, without story-based rewards). There are enemies with shields that completely breaks the flow of combat: homing attacks bounce off of them and cause you to bounce to the ground; these shields come out as soon as you homing attack, so it's not something you can avoid. This is weird because there are a second group of enemies that are a lot more fun to fight later in the game that also have shields that you can counter, which maintains the flow of combat.

Camera is jank in some places, as is Sonic tradition. Bouncing off of certain pads or going across certain boost pads will fix your camera and controls in a certain configuration: great for that mini-platforming puzzle, terrible for when you are rolling around at the speed of sound across the map and suddenly hit a rail or a bounce pad that causes you to have to stop and solve a short platforming puzzle before continuing. Rings are health, and health is meaningless; you can run in circles to get more. The trick system needs to have an option to be disabled, and some more work needed to be done on how Sonic sticks to the ground at high speed (he doesn't currently, and you can start a trick combo from sprinting over the slightest incline at higher speed levels).

Fishing is OP, yet is completely necessary to get those max level achievements. I was in the 60s in attack, defense and speed right before the games end (with a 1 in ring capacity); Fishing cut down on the tedium of fighting random groups of enemies just for the hope of 80+ drops, and cut down on literal hours of trying to find Koco for the other upgrades.

Finally, people have been calling this an asset flip, and while I don't necessarily agree completely, I can definitely see why people think that. The overworld doesn't feel like a Sonic world at all, and 3 out of the 5 of them look the same essentially. Contrast this with the stages, which, although short, have some character to them. Rails, bounce pads, and balloons litter the sky and replace any real form of aerial infrastructure. I am certain that somebody bought an asset pack for the fishing game (there are real fish/aquatic animals in the game).",,

Sega and Sonic Team certainly have finally made a great modern Sonic game.",,
"This game is garbage, can't even refund it because I bought it during a sale and didn't play it in time to discover the garbage of the actual game. It feels like there's so much yet nothing to do. The game looks alright in the graphics department, but a 60fps cap for a game like this is a bit weird. The actual levels are just copy and paste, the puzzles are boring and you get barely any reward (is getting to look at a map even a reward?). The game also feels really slow and clunky for a game series known for speed. I had more fun in Forces on my Switch than this. Go spend the money that you might've spent on this game on Persona, or better yet... food!",,
"6/10 at best. 7/10 if you include the amazing soundtrack.

This game is genuinely so unfun to slog through, I'd quit and tried to play through it again and just couldn't....

They try to take what makes running through a designed sonic level fun and littering zones with it. grinding rails, fighting cool mecha enemies, and jumping off of springs around cool set pieces get ruined and played out quickly.
it's fun at the start but after doing it again, and again, and again and collecting tokens again, and again and again its just not fun.

the movement is super strict and restricting lacking any vertical movement.

and if you go into it with the mindset of doing an entire island at the start you basically have most of sonics skills unlocked so there's nothing to really go for in terms of sonics progression, they don't give you new abilities to unlock or gear.

this game is a good first start but its just lacking, repetitive and a bit bland over all.",,

"[Non spoiler review]
Sonic adventure 1 and 2 were fully 3d experiences released back in the late 90's and early 2000's but sonic frontiers is still using 2d sections which should have been dropped since sonic generations if we are being honest. The only reason I bring up the adventure games is because this game flat out re uses levels from adventure 2 but with different assets. It also reuses levels from generations. these levels are fun and I really got a kick going through sky rail again (even if it's made with green hill assets) but for 60$ I would think i'd be getting a new game. 70$ if you get the ""digital deluxe edition"". While the stages were disappointing for the most part the open world was near perfection. The combat was very fun. Some might say you can just mash one button to win but honestly that really doesn't bother me and some of the moves you can unlock were very fun to use along with the parry. The end of the game felt very underwhelming but the journey was worth while. I don't think it's worth 60 dollars tbh but if you can get it on sale you'll be happy with the time you spend.",,

"My experience playing this game consisted of slogging through the generic areas that look like that one unreal engine Mario video, and the combat that got old faster than a roadrunner on hot coals, AND the completely non-functional cyberspace levels in order to get to the dialogue scenes that were the only thing keeping invested in the game. and then the ending threw that away anyways so there was no satisfaction, I was just left bitter and insulted. If you want good gameplay you will not find it here. If you want a well written sonic game go watch the cutscenes online, it will be significantly less miserable.",,
"Had fun finished the game but really not worth for the price. they said 5 islands but the 4th island is just the 2nd half of the first island. and the final island is also a cut portion of the first.

"The exploration is fun, but the boss fights and subspace just suck. the popin makes it hard to figure where some of the platforming starts in the exploration and you initially move way to slow feeling like your run isn't much faster than walking.
edit: my refund was denied so i might as well try to continue
edit 2: after beating the game my opinions still stands for the most part. the optional bosses are mediocre and the 2 terrible ones are squid and tank and the only interesting mandatory boss is the 3rd zone's boss but for that place it's the opposite of the rest of the game where exploring that zone is just awful and then the 4th could have just been a cutscene instead of a waste of a zone. i feel as though by making so many things optional they spread the game out too thin and didn't put the right effort into making the good bits better and removing the bad, most of the minigames are needlessly timed and just not good. i've had trouble when the game decides to force 2d sections into the exploration areas in which they just bugs out and not work or decides to have 3d controls while being locked in 2d camera worse is on those green climbing platforms where it doesn't matter which way i push he will only clime to the sides of it and fall off. if you die in the subspace levels that don't have checkpoints the timer still continues despite you having to start all over anyway. i think that instead the subspace should be mandatory for advancing the plot no more of those friendship tokens or whatever they are and the same with chaos emeralds and instead you get 2 chaos emeralds per zone except for the final so your not going super and then losing it in the next area and have 1 hidden and 1 through the boss and allow the player to play as supersonic after getting them all also not forcing them to fight the final boss after getting the 6th on in the final zone. leveling up speed and rings are both way too slow and make no sense the max speed and ring should just be default and the only things you should be upgrading are damage and defense. combat isn't great and you'll get all purchasable powers by the mid of zone 2 just through standard play with the only reason you'll ever engage in it is for the bosses, to get rid of nearby enemies just to be able to save or use your map or achievements and it's more annoying that starfall events respawn all enemies and bosses, especially since you don't need that many gears to unlock all the subspaces. you'll also max out you fishing coins after like 3 or 4 star fall events and the final zone's fishing will load you up on fishing token allowing you to buy your way to max level in everything and even just skip everything by just buying everything you need. most annoying thing is that you gain fast travel after completing all the challenges that reveal the map but the last 2 zones will be put them in locations you cannot reach until later in the game preventing the ability to fast travel outside of fishing the 2 scrolls, which i think needing to do that in every area is idiotic and should just be unlocked by doing it once in any fishing location and it doesn't need to be 2 scrolls should just be one. the story is ok, but it definitely doesn't carry the game enough to want to continue and i almost quit after the 3rd zone if it wasn't for the last going back to being like the first 2. it's crashed on me 3 times throughout my entire playthrough. i hope the next game focuses on the good aspects and is generally a more focused game. i could only recommend this game when it's like $20 or less since it really just feels like a tech demo for future sonic games. if i were to come back to this game it would be for the updates or heavily modded.

This bit is my review for another story. playing as amy and tails was fun, but knuckles was just terrible his glide is awful and if you miss the platform good luck trying to turn around and get anywhere near where you were. the animation for entering knuckles's glide and tails's mech and fly are annoying and just get in the way of using it outside of using knuckle's beginning glide animation to cheese the jump rope challenges, though the mech is really good. knuckles should also be able to climb any surface and not just red textured version of the blue/green ones sonic can run up and his grab onto said surfaces needs to be fixed as most times it looks like he isn't only for him suddenly latch on while other times just rams his head into it without grabbing it and if he even slightly touches anything or the end of it he'll slide down or just let go one time i was launched off of it for only bumping knuckle's head against the lip above the red platform and i can't tell you how many times i'd hold down on my control stick only for knuckles to still go up. tail's lack of a homing attack when all other's have one causes some platforming to suffer as your too used to having one and while i understand setting everyone besides sonic to base level 1 with little upgrades it does make starting a bit of a struggle though the star fall event does make gaining those levels easy, i still think all the abilities that sonic has should automatically be unlocked for the rest of them and all the future levels go into their unique stuff and not their basic attack. i gave up on the first trial tower and i implore sega to fire whomever made them or at least ban them from any form of level design. finally the spin dash was a nice addition except that once you let go of the button/trigger you lose all momentum you had, though i guess that's nothing new for this game. i would hope any level designer besides those that worked on this dlc make future games because if these guys are going to make future sonic levels then sonic's future looks bleak.
edit: i've read that it's recommended to switch to easy for the towers i'll try that and continue, but i'm leaving what i said earlier as i shouldn't have to change difficulty because of poor design. After doing so i can say that's how the towers should have been maybe with some added checkpoints on any difficulty it would have been fine if it weren't for the trials at the top. For the trials it lowers all your levels back to 1 and removes almost all your abilities and have such a tight time limit that it's almost impossible. All i can say is that while knuckle's bit wasn't fun, sonic's is a nose dive in quality as the towers are just pure trash that clearly haven't been tested and this entire bit need a lot more time in development. my recommendation for this is only play for the amy and tails bits, rush through knuckles to get to tails and quit once your playing sonic as the rest of it is horrendous. i quit on the snake trial and i'll be seeing if mods may fix this problem in the future. Sega needs to stop doing the bethesda thing where modders have to fix their game and actually make a complete sonic game without stupid problems.",,

"As someone who has lost to Winged Boom-Boom in Mario 3, this game is so easy to the point of boredom. The enemies are never a challenge, for how little they appear (on NORMAL mode.) The platforming doesn't feel like it even tried to be a challenge. The only times I got stuck in this game is when I don't see basic things. I had trouble on the first and second boss things too, but that was just because I didn't know to hold the parry buttons when parrying. I had literally no trouble on the third and final ones. The artstyle looks like those games where they plop Super Mario into an Unreal Engine forest, and call it a day. The music is pretty good though. Also, the Cyberspace levels were the most fun, particularly the ones that had level designs ripped from past titles. I might try hard mode, I dunno, but Normal mode was absurdly easy.",,

"This game is so incredibly unpolished that I'm inclined to think anyone who gave it a positive review exclusively eats their chicken nuggets off a ZooPals plate. The amount of positive reviews is absolutely baffling to me.

This game does not have momentum physics. Sonic hilariously sticks to any surface, so you won't be using the environment to your advantage. Press X? Stop in place. Press your bumpers? Stop in place. Jump? Lose your speed.

The camera jumps any time you hit the slightest uneven terrain or geometry. Do not play this game if you get motion sickness. I *WISH* I could upload the clips I got out of one hour of playing this game.

Combat is a mix of watching cutscenes, pressing X a *lot* or just holding Left Trigger, and drawing the occasional Cyloop. And Ikaruga knockoff. If anyone thinks this game has good combat, I implore them to go play an actual Character Action game.",,
"So far this game is better than basically anything made after adventure 2. It is fun especially if you're a fan but honestly for the price I think for those that arent a fan of sonic, you're going to feel ripped off for the price. Graphically it just doesn't stand up at all to what it could have been with LOD distance and cutscenes etc looking god awful and overall it lacks a heck of a lot of polish.

- Two-thirds of the cyberspace levels are just re-skinned levels or level segments from previous games.

- The islands are pretty underwhelming to explore and to look at with floating grind rails and platforms everywhere that will pop in and out of sight as you go.

- The controls caused me some grief, mainly because some of the commands are not where the previous games have conditioned me to expect them to be. I did end up swapping Light Speed Dash and Lock-on with each other on the controller.

- What I thought was a parry counter that sold me on this game is way too easy to execute and not even changing the difficulty made it satisfying to use.

- The enemy attacks have lousy visual and aural tells and they will often attack from off-screen.

- A lot of Sonic's attack animations are so long I ended up feeling like a spectator instead of an active participant.

- The enemy variety was okay but the bosses were more a mixed bag with Knight being the best one. The final boss was a joke.

- The tone is ill-fitting for Sonic. This is the most miserable adventure I've ever seen the Blue Blur and his friends undertake. The only times Sonic himself seems to be having any fun is when he catches something goofy at the fishing spot or when helping the Koco yields a Chaos Emerald. Even the voice actors sound listless.

- The plot spins its wheels until the fourth island (or the northern part of the first island) dumps most of it at once on the player and then promptly runs out of steam afterwards when it's time to take on the final island.

- This is the most newbie unfriendly Sonic game when it comes to the contents of its overwritten script and I feel bad for the kids for whom this is their first game in the series.

Edit: As for update 3 - the level design is spiteful, the enemies are damage sponges and the writing is still awful. On the plus side Amy and Tails are fun to play (Knuckles isn't) and the series sound director Tomoya Ohtani remains the undisputed MVP of this franchise that, frankly, doesn't deserve him.",,

"Sonic Frontiers is a must have game...if you're a hardcore Sonic Fan or someone who has played or knows about most of the games and some, if not most of the lore that is. People who aren't might have a hard time just trying to get into it. Literally almost every character in this game basically has a story arc, with loads of references to past games titles, and even some from non game material that most people won't get and will just pass by their brain without acknowledgement. I'm not saying that this won't be a good game for people who don't know much about sonic (though the reviews and telling me as such). This is still a fairly good game if you're interested. Sure some people are talking about the graphics being crap (which I do not care about personally) and the controls feeling off, which I agree with on the latter. But I very much love this game, if you don't like it. It's your opinion, I'm only really doing this review because I was just bored so I don't really care if no one reads this or not, I just have nothing else to do besides 100% completing this game.",,

"After getting all 40 achievements I can quite literally say, if you are a sonic fan who is in heart looking for a playground where you can just fluff around and waste time, this is your game. Just run around and have a good time.",,
"This is the first time since I was a kid that I was genuinely excited for a Sonic game, and my expectations were met. Even though it has some issues, they aren't enough to ruin the entire gameplay experience, which is refreshing. It's a new take on Sonic that works, but with further refinement, Sonic's future looks bright.",,
"sonic fans must have really low standards! the world is empty, it's a budget legend of zelda. there's no consistency in the level direction and the plot rips you into obnoxious cutscenes with below par sonic writing compared to the movie. i can see this having a cult following but to me it's just boring as hell.",,
"Update 3 more or less killed any hype I had for the finale. The base game isn't bad, But putting up with update 3 to get the true ending isn't worth the effort. I don't know what Sega was thinking, but they lost my support for 3D sonic going forward.",,
"Horrible Game Design

Lackluster Physics

"Very fun. a breath of fresh air after many other Sonic games (cough cough forces). Probably not what a casual player would enjoy, but I would recommend giving it a shot.",,
"This game could have been slated for greatness. This was the top of my list.
But instead what we got was 100,000 absolute piss poor design decisions.
The user experience UX (ie the mechanics of simple tasks / menus / tutorials getting around) is a hot f-ing mess.

I'm just to upset for words. I don't even want to play this game anymore.
I will probably post a more detailed review outlining particular issues at a later date.

That being said let me just say though I think the UX design team must have a real problem with authority.
I really do because everything seems like a giant middle finger to established norms.

They think they are trend setting.. They aren't, it's just terrible. Get your head out of your ass someone.
You suck big time.

Updated 3/3/2023:
I wanted to take a minute and outline the specific issues with this game.
Now that I had a minute to take.

It's the cut scenes.
And I don't mean because they are downright stupid (often passing along / worthless even insulting tidbits of knowledge on Sonics world win adventure into this unplayable farse), or the fact that they are completely unskippable.

It's the fact that it literally kills the game and your character.. Often in the middle of the air during a bossfight. Literally in the air, the game pauses for another stupid lesson on walking or jumping, what have you.

It unpauses and I fall to my death and get stomped on..

And you would then think after I successfully graduate the school of walking and jumping that would be the end of it..

BUT NO!! We go again.. Unskippable. And I die.. Again.

Bad enough I have to die every time..
But over this BS?? Insult to injury is putting it mildly.

And MY GOD the quantity..

Every second that ends in 5.
It pauses the game..

I said it back on release day a year ago and I'll say it again: This game functions, which unfortunately is a rare occurrence these days. The soundtrack's a banger, the combat feels satisfying, Sage is too precious and the overworld...gets the job done.
My main critique would be the very poor draw distance, making it often hard to see from afar how to get from point A to point B.

As for the Final Horizon story, I want to wish whoever made the trial towers and its final challenge a very not so favorable day.",,

"This one is difficult. On one hand, the open world is wonderful, fun, unique and immersive. But on the other, the story and characters are intolerably terrible. Overall, I enjoyed my time playing about without caring about story or objectives. But sadly, I couldn't advance that way and eventually got bored enough to drop it.",,
"It does have quite a bit of flaws that are easily fixable with mods (I have like 20 active mods lol), otherwise awesome game especially considering this is coming from Sonic Team, and the devs are constantly being pressured by early release dates by SEGA. It seems like they don't even care about the franchise anymore (which is the case actually, ever since SEGA merged with Sammy, a japanese pachinko machine maker).
I wouldn't say this is the best game of all other 3D Sonic games (call me biased all you want but I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ love Unleashed, even the Werehog parts, though Frontiers's combat is better) but the fact this game got like 2 million sales in the first month really says something. It even almost outbeat Genshin in the Player's Voice category in the Game Awards 2023. SEGA even came out with a statement saying they will increase their budget for future games, so I really can't wait!

I really enjoyed the combat, it's fast paced and amusing, though the upgrade system is too overpowered and even at lvl 1 for everything, it feels like it's too easy (especially the non-timing based parry, though that's fixable with mods). Running around the Open Zones is pretty awesome, though it would be better if jumping didn't kill most of your speed (though this is ALSO fixable with mods). Story is pretty good though apparently it wasn't written by Ian Flynn (a writer for the comics) like most people think: he was only responsible for the DIALOG, and that shows! Dialog is awesome, most cutscenes are decent at best, and there will be random cutscenes where characters talk but there is ZERO animations, which is weird. The bossfights are awesome (except the Moon or Supreme, which is a copypaste of the first bossfight and it's a bit rough around the edges). The controls are THE BEST out of all the boost games and Sonic feels awesome to control, but the problem is those same controls aren't present in the Cyberspace stages for some reason, which greatly decreases the fun to be had in these stages (though they have mostly reused level design from past titles and alot shorter), though luckily this is fixable with mods, and some mods have overhauled physics and controls which improves the feel of the game.


Overall very solid game, especially after the mediocrity that was Sonic Forces and considering the fact that approximately 25 devs were on the team to make this game, which is honestly surprising. I've noticed that the game can be very fun at times but also has core flaws that could only be fixed with future games (like for example the fact that environment in the Open Zones doesn't sit well with all the parkour obstacles and grind rails that float in the air).
I'd give Sonic Frontiers a 7/10, and with the mods 8/10. Like many other people have said, it's a very solid foundation for future games that might make this franchise relevant again, which I'm eager to see happening. I do strongly recommend you use mods to enhance the gameplay experience, too.

Also if you haven't heard, they are going to release 3 FREE DLC updates in the future (the first update already got rolled out by the time I'm writing this). So I'd say this game is worth getting. Especially with the very dedicated community of modders, it might extend Frontiers's lifetime before the next mainline game releases.",,

One of the best Sonic games I have ever played - truly an experience that redefines what a Sonic game is!,,
"Completed the first island, then realized I didn't want to do that 4 more times. This game feels unfinished and bland.

I got this on a sale for 20 bucks and it still wasn't worth it. Smh.",,
"Easily one of the worst Sonic games I have played. The physics fail to take any real amount of momentum into account making air control feel very bland. The combo system for combat is wretched and feels highly out of place in a Sonic title. Sonic does very little of being sonic and clomps around at glacial pace. To top it all off there is very little to actually do and most levels will barely last you 2 minutes.

Extreme disappointment for something I looked forward to.",,
"After only 2 hours of playing, I shut it off. Really really boring bro. Not only does it run like ass, but it really does FEEL like it was rushed. it's just ""Breath of The Wild but with a fast blue hedgehog, and none of the charm"". You had SONIC running in an open-world and you FUMBLED it. How on earth do you fumble that?
However, this game sold really well, so hopefully, SEGA give Sonic Team more resources to work with for the sequel...
The only redeeming thing about the game is its soundtrack (or rather parts of the soundtrack), but only if you're a Sleeping With Sirens fan.",,
"The game has definitely come a long way from when it first launched back in November 2022, between Sights and Sounds, Birthday Bash, and Final Horizon. This is definitely worth a look at, especially if you are already a fan of the series, as this game feels like a swan song to what we had before as it paves the way into the future.

If you are not a fan, I do suggest holding off until a sale (which happens regularly enough), as all of the good qualities I notice are because I am a fan. Regardless, the future of the series is looking brighter than ever, and I hope Sonic Team can keep this momentum going forward",,
"I rarely review anything I have not completed but Sonic Frontiers has already been good enough to wait until the end to review it.

Sonic Frontiers really surprised me. I went in expecting an open world idea for a game based on speed to be a bad idea. Turns out it was a great idea and the Sonic Team not only nailed the biomes but also the music.

The pop-in and out is explained by you not actually needing to see those things until you use them as there are many standalone obstacles in the game. 14 hours in and only onto World 3 as Sonic Frontiers actually encourages you to explore.

Yes it's pricey but I think given what you have here content wise it's worth it. This is one game where you really don't want to listen to the so-called critics.",,
"I have every achievement in this game, which means I did absolutely everything the game has to offer. If you're looking for a review that isn't dishonestly too good or too bad, this is probably the one.

Sonic Frontiers is probably my current favorite modern Sonic game. Is it perfect? No. LOL. No. Who puts forced 2D Camera Perspective Triggers in an Open World zone??? Island 3 was basically all 2D and I hated it. 2D Cyberspace was also annoying except the ones where I could do homing attack cancel launching, which is a technique that lets you skip entire segments of a level and is fun for speedrunning. 2D Sonic is fun, 2D Modern Sonic needs to go, it's terrible.

Everything else? I... yeah, it exceeded all my expectations so I can't really say anything bad. I had a blast, game's great overall. If SEGA stop doing this forced camera perspective nonsense and add better momentum and physics to world traversal, the next game will definitely be great. This one is very, very good, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I think there's a lot of room for improvement!

EDIT: Oh yeah I need to edit this review to point out, fishing in this game has really good and relaxing music and I love it, the rewards are extremely powerful (too much maybe?) and levelling up Sonic's stats took me 40 minutes of continuously talking to an NPC. Dunno what devs were smoking",,

"I would recommend this. One of the best Sonic games. I would have given this game a 9/10 but the idea of blocking story progress using stupid puzzles and specially that RNG pinball mini-game is the worst thing I have seen in any Sonic game yet and has destroyed all the experience for me.

"I love this game, this is not based in my sonic fandom but just the fact that this game is such a open world, with so much to do. The mechanics work well, the character and immediate environment looks well (the rendering may be off but that's understandable), from launch this is a great title but with the updates poised for 2023 including Tails, Knuckles, Amy and new levels should only make things better.",,
"Still in the early hours as of writing this but I have to say it, Sonic Team knocked it out of the friggin park on this one!

For real this is a genuinely good game that may also be a great one once I progress further. The platforming is tight & responsive, combat is varied & fun to pull of, exploring the open world is rewarding as it opens up & adds new ways to traverse it & the challenges to do so, yeah they can range from too easy to obtuse but they're still fun to do. There are also giant enemies that are pulled from Shadow of the Colossus & fighting them is equal parts combat & platforming challenge, & they kick a**! There's also challenge levels that pay homage to earlier games & have the gameplay seen in titles like Colours, Force & Unleashed. These are good to & come with their own challenges & have enough routes that make them a decent challenge in their own right.
It's not perfect. The texture work is pretty bad, the open world does look bland with a pitiful draw distance not helping, Sonic sticks out like blood on a bed sheet validating the tech demo comparisons, there's a fair amount of jank with the gameplay & the PC version has next to no real options. Hell it's framerate is capped between two options, 30-60 FPS. What the hell SEGA, what the hell.",,

The only issues I have with the games i easily fixed with mods and now it is the greatest sonic game I've ever played. I'm making this edit because before I said I had issues with the game that mods fixed. Well, the grand majority of those issues have been fixed with the 2 of the 3 content updates the devs released. And from what I hear about the third update, this game will soon become peak fiction, near masterpiece.",,
"After completing everything this game has to offer on hard I now feel extremely satisfied. If all sonic games are like this from now on, I can see a huge come back for sonic in the future.
With the game being open world, It doesn't feel limited at all and it's definitely a step in the right direction.
The combat feels great with all the new abilities you can use plus the classic homing attack for those who still want an older feel.
I felt a bit sceptical at first after hearing of a new sonic game but once I saw the main trailer and some gameplay I had high hopes and pre-ordered it instantly.

I would highly recommend this game to anyone who has never played a sonic game before but you might not understand a few references here and there. 9/10 - Not IGN",,

"I wasted so much money on this POS. Fishing to skip the game was the only good part. Zero level design except when taken from better games. Flynn did ok with the writing but it banks on the hope that there'll be something later and is very rushed. Softlocked in ares island cause the game is actually too good for me. I don't remember a single original track from the game so I can't comment on that really. Gameplay was extremely uninteresting and became repetitive. Ikaruga is really cool but I don't know how this watered down version of it made it into the game. Awesome ending though. Really, and I mean REALLY enjoyed how cool and awesome the final boss was. Definitely the highlight of my experience on this hedgehog-based earth we live in. Chaos island like everyone says sucks but forgets to mention that chaos island isn't an outliar in poor map design.

Only redeeming part is some of the characterisation. Just play any fishing game if you want the enjoyable parts for cheaper.

Overall no rouge the bat and black doom really hold back this game from coming into its own and the lack of zavok and infinite (the dynamic duo) are massive missed opportunities from the team. Played this game back to front adding this for update 3 would definitely make this game a 12/1 just like the classics. Also bring back yuji naka because he zeriously carried the development of these games

UPDATE: final horizon released and I have to say that they did nothing I said so it's pretty bad. The pop in got worse but I'm pretty sure that's just because I'm a bad player and that's also why they didn't balance the platforming and trials well. I also had like zero reason to level up as amy tail and knackle. I would have liked to be able to play the characters that the expansion revolve around and were paraded around a lot for the marketing. Also why can't there be cyberspace levels designed for them. Even if it was two or three it would be interesting to see how bad they could design each level for the three guys (and girl). This game has NO SWEARING, NO CUSSING and best of all, lots of bugs and animal crossing has bugs which is by nintentdon't so that must mean the game bad :). Anyway please find a way to mod knackle and tail as zavok and super duper zavok (my oc (link to deviantart)). Even on easy a lot of the trials required needlessly tight execution and knowledge of mechanics that hadn't been demonstrated to the player due to poor design earlier. This expansion feels rushed (planning-wise) but I do appreciate it being free even if the only seconds I enjoyed was in a plane and exploiting knuckles' ability to uppercut inifinitely. If they ever remove that mechanic the game will be a -1/10 but for now it is good enough to be a 3! (out of 100 (sick, roasted liberals owned and pwned :sunglasses:)). I refuse to take this series seriously for the next 50 years of my life. Oh yeah they also got rid of fishing so 1/10000 or whatever. Please make another good game sega I've been waiting since generations for a good game and been waiting since unleashed for a decent story. This expansion is basically all of my criticisms but like more I guess yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Sonic GO!",,

"I have been a Sonic fan for half my life. My obsession with this character has been reignited thanks to the movie and the amazing looking upcoming Prime series.

Which is why this review is so difficult for me to write. I never wrote a Steam review before. That changes today.

Full disclosure, I haven't beaten the game yet. But I am on island 3 and I highly doubt at this point my opinion on the game will change.

First I will say what I like. The Story is the best since Adventure 2. The character banter is charming and the characters are no longer the parody versions, but the ones people like me grew up with and loved. Nice to finally have a Sonic story again with Emotion and Stakes.

I really like the combat system. Everytime I fight enemies in this game I am having fun. I do think having two versions of each attack is weird but it isn't a big deal.

The Titan Boss fights... OMG! They are AMAZING! The first one woke me up from the lulled emotionless state I was in and gave me a real adreneline rush! There I felt like I was playing a Sonic Game! I am pretty sure the people who made those parts are not the same people who put in ""puzzles"" like cutting weeds with your cyloop in this game.

And that leads me to what I hate. Just like Sonic Movie 2, for every part I love, there is just as many parts that leave me baffled, wondering what on earth they were thinking.

The ""puzzles"" are a damn joke. Examples include, Stepping on tyles, A jumprope, a crane game, cutting weeds with your cyloop ( I am not letting that one go!), moving Kokos to your friend, running in place on a hamster wheel, blowing out tourches and very little else.

There are maybe one or two actual puzzles that are decent. But the rest are crap. This is what the Sonic Franchise needed! That is the part I can't wait to replay! CUTTING WEEDS WITH YOUR CYLOOP!!!

The open worlds are so bland. They are just generic landscapes with Sonic assets floating around. There are no side stories or anything worthwhile to discover. You just run around to the next grind rail, floating platform or spring and collect your metal. I am already sick of it. And the lifeless music in the open world makes it 10 times worse.

Cyberspace is a inferior Sonic Generations with just 4 THEMES: Green Hill, Chemical Plant, Sky Sanctuary and A City. 3 out of 4 of those are level themes I NEVER WANT TO SEE IN A SONIC GAME EVER AGAIN! Seriously Sega! I can't take it anymore. And even worse, a lot of level designs are reused as well. If I want to play Sky Rail or Green Forest I will play Adventure 2 Thank you! Not this cheap copy!

Sonic Games are usually action packed thrillrides. And some parts gave me that. The rest of the game put me to sleep. Boring worlds, baby level puzzles and underwhelming Cyberspace mixed with great combat equals me only liking one quater of this game.

Even if the game gets better from here. I can't see this game going above a 6 out of 10 for me. I knew in my gut that this game was not going to be good from the first gameplay reveal and that feeling never changed. But I blindly trusted Sega because after 5 years and the newfound popularity of the character, I expected better.

Moving forward, The Boss Fights, Controls and the Combat system are great! You nailed that Sega! Back to the drawing board for everything else. Even if the next game is my dream game Adventure 3, I will wait for reviews and a price drop.

Thanks for the reality check about the Franchise Sega. At least I have Sonic Prime and Movie 3 to look forward too.",,

"I can no longer get a refund.
So I want to say that this game does have a lot of good ideas and fun concepts with the use of speed.

But.

There are many terrible design choices. A lot of it has to do with combat, especially when it comes to fighting bosses and dying to a quick time event without even knowing that it's a ring match quick time. I died to some bosses five times and then you have to redo everything from the running portion and the fighting portion.

Then there is the difficulty with navigating where to go.
Sure there is a map, but the map is often unhelpful and you have to find the thing to make the map in the first place and it isn't some helpful tower.

Plus, there is forced 2D here and there when you're just trying to get somewhere.

I feel like this is a waste of time to play, and it's not a fun waste of time either. I do not recommend.",,

"One of the best Sonic games to ever exist, this is truly Sonic Adventure 3, just get it, it's extraordinary!",,
"It's not like it's a bad game. In fact, for a Sonic game it's good.

If you like Sonic, absolutely get it.

But for me personally, it's a step not nearly far enough in the right direction for a series that I always considered generally overrated, even back during the Sega Genesis glory days.

It's weird because in some ways its modernized design still feels like it's over a decade behind. And everything is just kinda vomited all over the map(s).

If I felt strong nostalgia for Sonic, it'd be a 8 or 9 out of 10. So it's great from that metric. I'd recommend it to them. But for people like me who always thought that Sonic was okay at its very best, this is the most okay Sonic game ever made. But I wouldn't recommend it for myself, or people like myself.",,
"The only good thing about this floaty mess of a game is that it made me gain the overwhelming desire to reinstall Sonic Adventures so I can go play an actually good Sonic game. I feel like Sonic Team should do the same so as to be reminded what they used to be before trying to create another half baked and poorly optimized game with emotionless voice acting, floaty controls, and disjointed graphics that made me feel as if I was staring at an early 2000s attempt at high end graphics to make the game look super advanced. They put more effort into the ocean around the landmasses then the actual game play.

Only get this heap of a game on sale if you absolutely have to and play it when you want an exercise in frustration. Outside of that don't bother at all with this thing. Go play Sonic Adventures and its sequel instead. Maybe start a petition to get Shadow the Hedgehog on Steam as well or don't because that port would probably be hot garbage.",,
"Probably the best Sonic game we've had in years.

Story: 9/10
Ian Flynn did an amazing job with the story, with this game sharing his take on Sonic's story and lore. It is leagues better than Pontac and Graff's writing.
But the dialogue does feature a lot of references to past characters and events from previous games, which at times gets a little annoying.
Overall still fantastic.

Graphics: 8/10
At times the areas are gorgeous but other times there is some random pop ins that feel tacky. I usually don;t find pop ins that bad but its very noticeable in frontiers


Gameplay: 7/10
The gameplay is sort of divided into 4 ""Sections"". Exploring the islands and doing mini obstacle courses, fighting enemies, doing little challenges, and cyberspace.

Exploring the island is super fun when running at super fast speeds, but the third island is pure misery, even with fast travel. 8/10

Fighting is bad ass, seeing sonic throwing hands is super cool, especially during bosses. It gets a but mind numbing with auto combo but it is optional.
I guess his smash bros moveset will finally get an upgrade. 9/10

Challenges: The actual ""challenge"" in the challenges varies. Sometimes its stupid easy, an actual challenge or just plain BS. But it gets the job done. 7/10

Cyberspace: This is the games weakest point. Its very clunky like Forces where you go super fast and fall off the stage and super slow platforming.
Its tolerable, but it gets way to difficult at some points. 6/10

There is the fishing minigame as well but I don't care to rate it.


Sonic does not disappoint with its banging soundtracks. To the relaxing piano in the over world, or to the HEAVY METAL in boss fights that remind too much of Metal Gear Rising.
Its epic, enough said.


Overall a great game that should of won Players Choice aside from GENSHIT MIDPACT.

8/10.",,
"Fun game to be honest, there are something that do need improvement but overall the Sonic Team is headed in the right direction.",,
I'M HERE,,
"5 years of development only for the game to have 3 unique islands and recycled cyberspace level design complete with jank controls. The supposedly good dialogue is filled with references which read like they're from a fan wiki and the music is forgettable EDM and metalcore which admittedly sounds good even if out of place for a Sonic game. A respectable 6/10 game being inflated by people with no standards.
If you're looking for a fun 3D Sonic game, play Adventure, Unleashed or Robo Blast 2 instead.",,
"Pretty buggy and laggy, level pop in is real bad.
The open world is tacked on and is only there because Sonic Team wanted to ape off Breath of the Wild.
The levels are just more Generations levels with some challenges.

"I really want to play this game but the text isn't readable. I'm on the Steam Deck OLED and the resolution is set to the highest setting it can manage.

Update:
Playing on my computer now and it turns out you have to UNLOCK the EXIT BUTTON. There is legitimately no way to close out the game properly until you get through the tutorial. Peak nonsense, terrible dog-doo design XD",,
"Great game. I see why it's so well reviewed on Steam by users. Render distance on a lot of the jumping puzzle stuff should be raised. Other issues I had the mod scene has fixed between rebalancing staging, moves, annoying turn-ins, and a section of the game that I'm not going to spoil.",,
"Let's start on the negatives, so we can leave on a good note. Every Cyber Space level are copied level design from other Sonic games. Story reason or not, I find this pretty pathetic. If I wanted to play Generations, then I'd play Generations. If I wanted to play Unleashed, then I'd play Unleashed. Hell, if I wanted to play Sonic adventure 2, then I'd play Sonic Adventure 2. This a full price retail game, this is inexcusable. It doesn't help that Sonic is designed for the open world here, and not these very linear platform heavy stages, that mind you weren't designed with his physics in mind, as they are just copied from other Sonic games. it is clunky. Sonic's jump also isn't very good. Sometimes the game will expect finer movement from you with platforming, and the jump is just not good for it at all. It serves its purpose, but it could be better. The open world is sorta just a very big hub world. Despite being open world, it really is not. The game is incredibly linear. Sure while you can technically go wherever you want, the game will constantly force you into directions that you weren't planning on going. Everything is separate from each other, there is absolutely no smooth transition. The story is sorta boring until I wanna say the 2nd island. It sorta just doesn't give you anything to hook on for the first 4 hours. One big thing that was disappointing was that the bosses did nothing but get worse. The first by far was the absolute best and most fun, after that they just get less and less cool, and the final boss I'd say is completely boring. While not inherently a flaw, I think the physics aren't a great fit either. I'd imagine most if not everyone would love to see a game where you control your speed and how fast you're able to go by mastering the terrain, and not by pressing a button to just go fast. This works in games like Unleashed and Generations, because those are most definitely what I'd call quick time event games. The game benefits from knowing when to use it, and how you want to use it. But in Frontiers, I think it's just unnecessary . This does nothing but make it feel like Generations and Unleashed, but worse. Because it doesn't add anything to the game. Also the visuals are boring, it's just the real world but you plop Sonic and some ancient tech into it. But enough of the negative. Firstly, I love this game, and it was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome. Despite everything I've said, the game manages to be fun. While I don't think it's the best gameplay, it certainly had a ton of effort and passion put into it, and I respect it. The game is fun, a lot of fun, and that's all I can really say about it. I don't exactly know why it's as much fun as it is, but it's fun. They did well with what they had. The first boss at the very least was super ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun, and hype as ♥♥♥♥. 2nd was also good, just not as hype. And for the first time since Unleashed, did the story actually feel epic. Besides the boring first few hours, I quickly became invested in it's plot. And the new character Sage is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ adorable and I love her. The music is an absolute banger too. Good lord, this ♥♥♥♥ is awesome. Never has Sonic felt more like an anime since...idk Black Knight? Anyways, the game has flaws, but damn is it a good foundation. I'm certainly happy with what we got. And I'd even say it's worth the full price. And it certainly makes me super excited for it's sequel. If they keep with this formula, I have no doubt the sequel will be a 10/10. But for now, I'd have to give Frontiers a 7/10. But it's certainly worth it. It may have issues, but I promise you will have fun. And that's my long ass review of Sonic Frontiers. Oh, and the references are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome, and a few made me ♥♥♥",,
"[I've played this longer than what the play count says by playing this on another PC with Steam. also this latest edits had a overhaul in typo and grammatical error fixes and some better nuances since the last edit. e n j o i !]
If you want the positives go read the other reviews that gave the game a recommended rating. otherwise read this if you wish to see the my constrictive criticism towards the game.
I'm only looking at the negatives since I feel that not enough people are talking about these issues sadly.
The game needs many improvements before I can recommend this game at full price. Is it a good game? Is it a fun game? yes to both of those questions BUT, It has so many minor issues that culminates and accumulates to me wanting to tell people to skip this game unless it's on sale for at lease 40-45 bucks. It's a fun game but this game does not deserve a 90% positive rating,this game deserves more like a mid 80% positive rating.
The minor issues are so easy to fix if Sega would simply stop forcing their game design philosophies onto the paying customers. As too, I feel that too many other big AAA Japanese game developers are guilty of implementing.
Here are the many minor issues I have with this game:

Forced 16:9 aspect ratio:
This needs to go. there's enough of a good chunk of people with 16:10 and even 4:3 aspect ratio'ed screens to expect that such a simple ability should exist. thousands of PC games has always adjusted aspect ratio to screen resolution. Sega forcing people to have a crappy letter-box should honestly be toasted out of there. It's not cinematic, it's not aesthetically pleasing. It's an eye sore. It's just pure laziness if Sega ushers out an excuse for this. If thousands of games, for almost two decades can do this, then I think a company with many-many in millions of revenue can do it too.

Forced on the scripted path segments: This is my second biggest gripe with the game. It's almost a deal breaker, but it's not to that point thankfully, it just ruins the fast pace feeling of the game in a lot of the time playing. Sega should simply implicate a function where you have to at lease keep holding the joy stick up and not press jump in order for sonic to continue going through a loop or corkscrew. implementing a magnet system too where I can run off the path when or if I really want to ( as in If I tilt the joy stick Really far away from the path that would throw me off the loop.)
If I press Jump I should be able to jump off to my death if I want to. This is such a little thing that can give a player such a sense of good speed and control in the game. Honestly How is this not fixed even in a mod?! I just love sonic adventure 1 more than this game just simply due to the fact that it has FAR less scripted routes in that game and I have that sense of control of speed and actual fate of sonic when I go through the high speed action. It would just make me feel like I'm actually causing sonic speed instead of the computer doing it. If I have no sense of control then I can not have any of a good sense of speed, and I can not feel also that I am the creator of that speed when playing the game, it's as simple as that. It's like forcing a car to drive in a straight line at a constant velocity during a curve or during a long stretch of road in a racing game, it ruins the immersion.

Forced 30 to 60 fps caps:
ಠ_ಠ... ಠ__ಠ... ಠ益ಠ !!! NO!!! Sega please let people use their rtx4000s graphics cards and 144hz monitor. For crying out loud! Is it because the physics engine is heavily reliant on the frame rate? Is the code unoptimized? You guys do have that crappy Denuvo drm that weighs down the performance so adding a frame lock just to hide this fact does not help. It just cheapen the experience since the occasional frame drops still happens and mods still exists anyways to gain back the higher frame rates. Other than that there's no valid reason to force people to a frame rate, It doesn't make your game look more professional when you want to hide frame drops. I honestly really feel that Sega is only forcing these design choices just to try to force their game to look more ""Polished."" When in actuality, it makes the final product look lazy and cheapen the game and it's experience.

Forced camera angles: The second cyberspace level in the desert island has the worse side effect from having a forced camera. I was trying to jump from spinning platform to spinning platform and this caused so much deaths in this area due to the lack of depth perspective from a fixed camera angle that other wise moving the camera around to get the feel of the depth of the area could of fixed. I HATE FORCED CAMERAS WITH A BURNING PASSION! when I am in a 3D environment running and jumping. It makes me feel so claustrophobic and it ruins the sense of depth. It's a failed attempt to make it look epic and while it does not give a cinematic effect what so ever, so please, give up on that gimmick...

Wonky physics: Even with all the attempts to try to make their game look ""polished"" by forcing,a la man-handling the player's head to look away from all the bugs that are under Sega's digital fancy looking lounge chair, they still failed to make this game feel totally polished. Like the one level I've mentioned from the Forced camera angle segment... Adding to the forced camera issue, this second cyberspace level in the second island chapter where I started off with crazy speeds in the level caused me to still managed to die so much due to the crazy high speeds and awkward, smallish, cramped, jumping spaces I had to deal with. There's a bunch of minor wonky moments sprinkled throughout the game like this that rarely but occasionally happens like this... but the worse parts are the boss fights. They are jankier than trying to wear thick winter gloves, while playing a toy piano, in an attic, during a power outage, during the winter season...
Trying to climb on the bosses are so hard just simply due to the collision detection not being the best to deal against with these bosses. It's not a deal breaker but it's still a problem.

short cyberspace levels:. These levels are like traditional sonic generation/sonic colors levels. The only problem is that they are only a minute long. I wish they were more like 2-3 minutes long to extend the game play a bit. I know they are not the main focus and the open world islands are, but man... it would make the game feel more robust.

Needs more loops: I love loops. Needs more loops.

miscellaneous: The only other problems are minor, like how the game explains things to me that I feel don't feel that comprehensive and easy to understand right away which gives me vague impressions when first being introduced to these concepts. The constant interruptions for boss fights and when I got that boost power up thingy ruins the sense of speed sometimes. The graphics could be a bit jagged looking but properly setting up your graphics card drivers can really make the game look beautiful! Mods that add a more colourful palette rendering helps brings the game to life. This game really does look so much better with more vibrant colours and menu tweak. one more minor issue is that the English voice actors are way too deep spoken... so thank goodness I can use the more atmospheric and melodic Japanese voice actors that don't sound like they take testosterone injections every morning...

I'll say this closing this semi review. I'm glad Sega at lease given us so many options for gameplay and how we can handle sonic. It's just a shame that we traded all of those nice gameplay options in the omission for many graphics options. This is a somewhat wonky PC port that could of been better. It's a good game but a with a lot of flaws in it that people should be aware of.",,

You are missing nothing good otherwise. Level layout is boring, annoying, and will kill you for no reason often. Cyberspace levels are boring, annoying, and will kill you for no reason often. Bosses are boring, annoying, and the camera will make you take hits for no reason often. Story is boring, has no real stakes aside from rescue friends, and the only good part was added in last minute so there's nothing gained from it.",,

Uninteresting open world(s) with nothing to do in them. Repetitive combat and gameplay loop. I don't mind the fast levels being short but i do mind not having variety in them. They're not that different from one another aside from like two.

Sage {the little girl} is also boring and she's supposed to be the most important to the story.,,

Even after a google search everyone agrees that it's just the game being a terribly done piece of software with no quick solution. If you're a fan of Sonic then play it! but do NOT pay it.

"Fantastic sonic game, with a great story, excellent new characters, amazing characterization, good writing, GOATED bosses, fun combat, some of the tightest movement since even adventure 2. i think this game easily blows every boost game out of the water, while also holding up to adventure 2. the new controls having everything ACTUALLY MAPPED TO IT'S OWN BUTTON was a looong time coming and made the experience just that much better. the games not perfect, the 4th zone goes on for a little too long, the 2d cyberspace stages just don't feel quite right, the 4th boss is a little underwhelming compared to the other 4, and most of the levels are either inspired by, mixed up version of, or literally are old levels which is definitely love it or hate it. i also wish there were more than 4 themes for said levels and that they weren't GREEN HILL AND CHEMICAL PLANT... AGAIN. Over all however, the game is fantastic. i'd easily give the game an 8.7 for returning players, then maybe an 8 if you don't really have any history with the franchise.",,
"No pre-load. Denuvo. I sure do love being treated like a pirate!

Honestly, the game is fine. It's a solid meh/10.

The open world is basically a hub. Sure there are things to jump on and bosses to fight, but all the levels are linear instances and play just like all modern Sonic games. The open world part is... messy. Sonic's movement is very twitchy and not fluid at all. If you walk slowly over rocky ground Sonic snaps into position so he's always standing perpendicular to the surface.

Lots of weird/bad design choices. For example, the enemies have an angular triangle theme going on and Sonic's homing attack indicator is a triangle. Half the time I think the homing indicator is a decal on the enemy.

The combat is probably the best part. But again, plagued by bad design choices. I died fighting the first boss and only then did the game explain to me that pushing two buttons at once would allow Sonic to parry attacks. That would have been more helpful information instead of ""push A to jump.""",,

"Ahem... hello, ladies and gentlemen, girls and boys, and dudes of all teenages, as well as the, uh, gals. My name is Christian Chandler; I am here, and y'all are there. This message is for everyone of the present and the future, beyond this date: February 24th, 2007th. My birthday. My 25th birthday.

I am high-functioning autistic, and in my 25 years, I have seen and learned so much. And today, I am share--intend to share some wise words that I hope each and every one of you will take to heart and will offer yourself and everyone else a better, brighter future.

First off, remember that going to school is not a torture. It is a place of learning, a place for growing, a place where you form the spilling of your own opinions, your own feelings, and your own personality. So learn everything you are able to, and grow with it.

Now, you should also be able to try something for yourself, before forming praise or detest of it. As long as those things will not harm you, or shorten your lifetime in any way, it's totally cool.

What is totally NOT cool, though, is thinking or doing these things, which are very harmful to you, and definitely gr—will gross out those around you that don't do it, because I haven't done it and I don't like it—doing either of them. You should avoid at all costs smoking, drinking alcohol, and intaking any similar icky dangerous stuff. And smoking will eventually cause cancer, and it will—you'll be more likely to get heart attacks, viruses, and your life will be cut drastically short. They don't call cigarettes and cigars ""death sticks"" for nothing, other than killing you slowly. If I could, I would take every last ounce of tobacky, put 'em on a rocket, and shoot 'em up to the Moon. And for, uh, alcohol, they'll cause, uh, liver dysfunction, kidney prob—kidney failures, and uh, not only that, but, when you get drunk enough, bar fights and automobile accidents. So it's a real slow-acting poison. And I haven't done either one, and look at me now, I'm, uh... fit as a fiddle, and I'm livin' twenty-five, hopin' to live on to be about eighty to a hundred. And y'all—hopefully, y'all will get a chance to get up to that ripe old age, as well.

Now, among the better things you should definitely try before despising, is some of the hobbies of those of your own—opposite gender. Like, uh, for example, if you are a young gentleman, I recommend buying yourself a My Little Pony figure of your favorite color or whatever. Now, uh, stroking the hair of said pony is very relaxing and therapeutic, and also rubbing it against your cheek. That's... nice. And also, uh, you can pretend that, uh, the pony is, uh, that girl you want to take you wanna take out to—you wanna take out sometime, and talk to the pony like you would talk to the girl.

Now for the, uh, ladies I would recommend... a good old Autobot from Transformers. Because you can get to learn how to examine the mechanics... and variations of... each and every... I mean, of the, uh, Autobot you have... like, uh, you would tr—like you would learn how... a man... works. And it'll allow you to feel more comfortable in approaching, and talking to, that boy you've been flirtin' from a distance, or, uh, just have been, uh, flirting with from a distance. And, uh, hopefully, uh, all you have to do is just end up and say ""hello"". I mean, it's not so hard. All you have to do is say ""hello"" to the man, ladies; that's all. And everything will just get going from there. And also, uh, with the, uh, Autobot, while it's in vehicle mode you can pret—drive down that imaginary fast lane.

But any—in any case, uh, while few people may ridicule you, you should not worry about it, because most everybody will be o—totally okay with it, because it won't matter. It won't matter, because they see you enjoyin' it, and it's totally cool, if you're enjoying it. So you enjoy it, just do it—don't worry about other people's opi—pinions. Because, uh, compared to the other schools, those people who disregard you are just total peanuts. And I'm not talkin' Charlie Brown; I'm talkin' 'bout the little nuts after the shells. The real peanut gallery. That would be peanuts, wouldn't it?

Also keep in mind that, while you're playin' with these things, you should keep in mind of what your true, original gender is. Because, uh, it's like you worry about that girl you want to take on a date—YOUNG MAN!—or, uh, likewise, you feel more comfortable to approach that boy—by just saying ""hello""—that you've been checkin' out from a distance—YOUNG LADY!—and hopefully in due time or now, each and every one of you will stay straight. You know, girl for boy, boy for girl? Everything else is vice, as said by Doctor Kinsey. Not just for me, not for The Big Man Upstairs, not for your family, but do it for, uh, yourself, and for—and for the benefits of everyone in the future: your children, your children's children... And, besides, if you stray away from the straight path, it can really jeopardize the entire future of the world and the human race.

Also, girls and ladies, don't just go over gaga, over the handsome rich boys... and men... because they may turn out to be disrespectful and distasteful in their personality. You should take into consideration all the other gentlemen that you may have considered, that may be less attractive, or equally—less or moderately. Because those will—because they will likely have a better personality that you will—that you will generally enjoy and like, and they may end up having a brighter future for themselves. Like, look at me now—I'm shootin' this movie for a DVD... that's gon—that I hope will be shown in a couple of schools, at least.

Now, uh, also, uh... also, when you—when each and every one of you has a true general understanding of the, uh, opposite gender, and after that—finding that special MAN—LADIES!—or that special GIRL—GENTLEMEN!—always keep the... heart and memories of times that you two felt most attracted to each other, because that will be a key point to recovering from any disputes or arguments that you two might have in the future. Otherwise, so you two will just be darn happy with each other. But it's not all always gonna be peaches and cream or strawberry shortcakes. And also remember, you two should KEEP each other, because there will be nobody else—no matter how much you think about it—nobody else that can replace that special someone—him for her or... her for him—there's just nobody else...there's no substitute for that first one.

And now, I leave you with the lessons that you should have—I hope you have learned from my message. You should all—you should stay in school, learn as you much. And try before you praise and despise. Never smoke! Never drink! Never worry about how others think of you when you do things... or... when you play with things that may not s—that may not seem like you—or whatever. Don't be afraid to approach those of your opposite gender. And MOST IMPORTANTLY! PLEASE... STAY STRAIGHT. I leave you with those words, as I have shared with you on this, my twenty-fifth birthday, February 24th, 2007. I am ""Christopher"" Christian Weston Chandler. Live long, and shine on, in your very own unique way. War is never the answer; peace is. Never fight. Compliments will get you fuzzy-wuzzies. War gets you prickly-wicklies... as well as punches. They get you those, too. Thank you very much, and have a wonderful day.",,
The game is really fun so far but I will wait until there are unlocked fps and draw distance mods to get the best experience. No Steam Deck support and Skyrim level textures are cons.,,
Amazing story and amazing visuals one of the best sonic games in a while,,
"An actual good Sonic game, please play this.",,
l wish l can play it without a graphic card,,
"I feel like THIS is the game I've been waiting for from SEGA after all these years. THIS is how you properly try new things with the Sonic series. The open-world, the fighting mechanics, this game offers so many fresh new experiences while still delivering that nostalgic feeling. Long story short;
SONIC IS BACK. FOR REAL THIS TIME.

ps. to all the dumbasses downvoting this game over denuvo, take your whiny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to reddit. it has zero bearing on this game as a whole, and you wouldn't know it existed if you didn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ google it first LMAO",,
This game is a pile of garbge it dosent hold a candle to sonic 4 eoiosde 1,,
"Explorer based Sonic, been playing for 6 hours so far and other then some of the locked camera angles I have no complaints.",,
"It's good, just don't play the final horizon. ♥♥♥♥ almost drove me insane.",,
There is no sex,,
I'd say this seems like the start of a new Frontier for Sonic (see what I did there?),,
"The game is an excellent foundation for future sonic games. By the 4th island the story feels in-cohesive(?). Giganto & Wyvern are amazing boss fights while the other two not so much, pretty much confirming my theory that by the time the 3rd island was done they rushed development to meet the deadline and release it on time. Pop-in it's a constant issue but nothing game breaking. Lastly the final boss was not was I was expecting, I didn't feel the same excitement as the previous bosses but the music helped a lot to make the battle memorable.

Overall this game is great, sonic adventure 3 will be amazing if Sonic Team polishes what they offered here",,
this game actually sucks dont let sonic fans gaslight you into thinking otherwise,,
10/10 I cry,,
"Sonic The Hedgehog in Breath of the Odyssey. Joke aside this is Sonic's stab at open world games and it feels natural. The story is good stand alone but confusing as a long time fan, still didn't ruin the fun. Only hard disappointment was that the drop-dash locks you into a single direction but even then its not that bad. It's been 10 years that Sonic Team made a good game so let us hope they stick with what worked here because it works really well. Modding is going to be massive.",,
"Normally, I really enjoy Sonic games, and with the praise it's been getting, I had high hopes for Sonic Frontiers. While some redeeming moments shine through, like the dialogue and soundtrack, the bulk of the game lags behind.

I'll note that the game is split into two very different modes of gameplay: Open Zone (the photo-realistic landscapes) and Cyberspace (the stylized, linear stages). If you like one of these, there's a good chance you'll dislike the other because they're near-opposites.

-VISUALS
In one word? Indistinct. For such large worlds, the Open Zone has so little variation in terrain shape or colour that Sonic feels like he's wandering through a procedurally generated parody of Kansas. With all the rich and imaginative environments that other Sonic games have featured, the choice to go photo-realistic for the Open Zone is a head-scratcher, though I think photo-realistic Sonic have been passable if given a minimum of effort. Instead, it all feels like infinitely repeating stock assets. This meme song puts it well:


As for the Cyberspace levels, their visuals look much nicer, but the same four level themes are reused for seemingly the entire game. Once you've seen the first several Cyberspace levels, you have quite literally seen them all. All but one of these visual themes are also reused concepts from retro Sonic games. That can be done well, like in Sonic Generations, but... hang on a sec, all of these particular levels already revisited in Sonic Generations! And this re-retreading is no coincidence either: many of the assets in these levels are also visibly lifted from Sonic Generations, a game that's over a decade old, and they're still the best-looking assets in Sonic Frontiers. If you've played Generations, Sonic Frontiers' cyberspace will feel redundant, and if you played Generations, you should be buying it instead of this; it's currently on sale for only 5 dollars.


Most of the gameplay in both Open Zone challenges and Cyberspace levels is superficial, overusing chains of props like springs, ziplines, and literal rails to railroad Sonic toward an objective while you might as well not touch the controller, save for a token homing attack chain here or there... pretty much a quicktime event. Sonic's movement in Open Zone may feel nice, but that doesn't matter when he's locked to rails half the time. Even the more involved levels/challenges are all comically short. Instead of having a smaller number of meaningful challenges, Sonic Frontiers goes quantity over quality with an extreme number of tiny, insignificant challenges, with most of your time spent walking them. These trivial challenges feel unfulfilling, unmemorable, and indistinct from one another. The fact that all of them use the same visual assets certainly doesn't help their tendency of feeling samey.

The combat in Open Zone is a little more interesting, with a surprising amount of abilities, but 90% of the time the optimal move is to just spam 'X', and if that doesn't work, use the cyloop and spam 'X'. If you simply ignore this trend and choose to fight more creatively anyway, for style, you can have a little fun.

In Cyberspace, Sonic's movement feels very different. He's oddly slower, probably intended to make him feel more manageable in the cramped, linear Cyberspace levels. Instead, Sonic's inability to get moving under his own power just makes him feel overly reliant on dash panels, dash rings, or homing attacks to get anywhere. Though I will admit, practicing for a perfect run where you weave through all of those interactables for an S-rank time is an experience all its own. I'd compare the feeling to rhythm games, minus the musical connection. I'm a fan of that ""Time Trials"" experience, but with the Open Zone having no start and end, Cyberspace is the only place to do that in Sonic Frontiers. If it sounds like your thing, I'd recommend you buy almost any other Sonic game.


This is one of the game's stronger points. Having known these characters for a long time, it brings a smile to my face seeing them characterized so... in-character. The dialogue feels earnest, in stark contrast to many other Sonic stories that feel like campy parodies of themselves, embarrassed by their own characters. Bringing on long-time Sonic comic writer Ian Flynn for this story was no mistake, but if you like Ian Flynn's writing... you'll have a better time reading his comics instead.


Sonic games are known for their incredible soundtracks. Most games come with soundtracks, This one is no exception, though there is some hit-and-miss: In the Open Zone, music is usually slow, ambient, sometimes even poignantly expressive, but it's usually so understated that it fades into the background. I struggle to recall any of it because of how indistinct it all felt. In Cyberspace though, the music is on <insert stimulant here>! It may consist entirely of fast-paced electronic music, but the themes in each are distinct enough to stand out. Unfortunately, none of the music is written specifically to fit the level it plays on; it be, because 30+ songs are being distributed across only four level themes. If you're here for the soundtrack, it's also officially available standalone (for far cheaper and in easier listening formats).


This game is somewhat buggy, but I'm sure that surprises no one. ""Pop-in"" is an understatement when you're running across Open Zone and smash into an obstacle that is invisible because it has not yet rendered, and not render for several more seconds. At least frames-per-second were usually smooth, save for one GPU-strangling bug that dropped me down to 4-5 FPS once, but resolved by re-launching the game.


Sonic Frontiers is hit and miss, and even the things that hit are done better by other media, Sonic and non-Sonic. I'll admit that I stopped quite early (opting to refund), so the game could change later in its run, but it doesn't seem to from the footage I've looked at. Frontiers is reasonably long, so if you enjoy it, you'll get a lot out of it. There are also free content updates coming to it in the future, which might address some of these shortfalls, but we'll have to wait and see. All-in-all, there's some enjoyment to be scavenged for, but I don't think it's worth 60 dollars, or even the $42 sale it's presently on.",,
I can't stress enough how good this game's soundtrack is. The ending is beautiful and I didn't expect it to hit me as hard as it did. By all means a fantastic experience.,,
"okay so basically, he goes really fast",,
hog go zoom zoom 12/10,,
This game is kind of bad.,,
pretty fun game once you get the controllers to work,,
Sonic...,,
"Product refunded

Could not get into it. Mostly because of QTE and number of input to do simple actions.

For me sonic shines when it's fast, with simple inputs. Here ... I don't know .... As far as gameplay is concerned, this game felt to me like an adventure fighting game. Lots of input for quite a lot of ""slow"" time.

I get that, if you get used to it and progress in the game you might get to a point where Sonic actually runs fast and do pretty cool stuff. But that was also true on dreamcast and there were far less input to learn.",,
"I'm actually incredibly disappointed with this game. I can't give an 'overall' review because I don't want to play too long to get a refund. I waited a long time to get to play it in the first place because I'm not made of money so I waited for a sale ($24 USD) and unfortunately didn't even find it worth that price. From the start the game is unsettling in an uncanny valley sort of way. Everything is gigantic and empty and bland in the 'main world' and confusing in the 'digital world' and that's not the best- but for me the final straw was the lack of voicing or labeling for some lines... not even a full hour in and Sonic is trying to talk to this Coconut guy, right? Well, you can read the lines on the bottom, but they don't say [Sonic: <line> Coco: <line>] they just go line - line - line - like it's a conversation but you don't know who is saying what. And when lines ARE voiced, their mouths certainly don't sync up to the lines at all. Like nobody even bothered to make mouths be opened whenever there were words.

It just feels like a bunch of college students smacked some unity assets, cliches, and the Name Brand Sonic Characters together in it. I tried to look up online if it would get better (because I love the characters) but after reading some small spoilers I was only encouraged to simply return this and get a game I know for certain I'd enjoy more.

I'm sad about this. I'm not the kind of person who gives aggressive 'it sucks' reviews. But for a new-ish game with an asking price of $60 USD at full price... idk, guys, it kinda sucks.

I like the little tiny coconut knock-off koroks. But that's about it.",,
"Good ideas, and even decent execution for the first two islands. Chaos island has way too much 2D, the game's janky as hell (especially Cyber Space) and it has imo the worst ending in any Sonic game ever. There's no real reason to replay it either, aside from the hype titan boss fights (which should have been in a Boss Rush mode). Everything else feels incredibly tedious and tiresome due to how repetitive it is.",,
"The original game was kinda enjoyable, starts to get grating and boring the more areas you do. Too many 2d segments for a 3d game as well, the usual Sonic problem. Combat dull and is practically just press button for cutscene. Bosses are most of the good of this game and even those can be bleh. Physics and control problems that really shouldn't affect Sonic games. Went back to play the new content but it doesn't feel like they learned anything. Knuckles controlled so badly that I gave up for now.

TLDR: You may enjoy the game like I did at release, but honestly it's not a game I can recommend, and this DLC is not a good time so far.

PS: ♥♥♥♥ denuvo.",,
"if you ever wondered how many different mechanics & themes from various games you could cram into a title (that needed no extra mechanics btw) this is it. Also extremely jank, you will be clipping thru bosses left and right
Also it's ""borrowing"" from:
*BOTW
*Mario
*Shadow of Colossus
*Horizon Zero Dawn
*Ace Combat 4/7 (Stonehenge)
*Evangelion
*Subnautica

Sonic and Knuckles are more than homies <_>
If you like SA1 and SA2 and upvoted this game, make like Gamma. Every SA level & area has a theme or vibe to it - this is just generic ""biome"" with meaningless obstacles plastered here and there. The music is appalling and not unique or interesting in any way. I'd rather turn on a white noise machine or put q-tips all the way into my eardrums. Tinnitus is better than this. The pop-in is really bad too - and was this made for a 3DS or for PC/Console?
i need to play something else to cleanse my palate",,
"Gameplay is good, unfortunately this seems to be a half baked PC port.

Menu controls are unintuitive and you can't use the mouse for graphics options.

I know Sonic games are meant to be played with a controller but using the mouse to control the camera feels like actual mud, and just shows how little effort was put into the PC version of this game. You can tell the mouse controls are mapped to momentary joystick inputs in the engine and it doesn't work *at all*

Combine that with a 60 FPS frame cap, bad pop in, Denuvo DRM, and cutscenes that only play in 30FPS and look garbage. It's not a great recipe.

HOWEVER, I have played a fair number of Sonic games and this one (in my short play time) seems to have actual good gameplay, which is more than I can say for the other games I've played. So I will be refunding the game for now but if there's a patch with FPS unlock and Denuvo is removed, I will probably come back and give this game another chance, because I really do want to like it.",,

fast,,
The game is broken and horribly buggy. Its very unstable on PC and I got the sense that the only reason it didn't crash is because I have a 12 core CPU in my PC. The game shouldn't have the positive rating it has. Yes its technically better than SOME of the other sonic games but overall its far from the best one yet. The game needs to get fixed hardcore.,,
"In the beginning, it can be fun, but later in the game, it is always the same thing, boring levels and gameplay. No replay value, gets to easy and disappoiting final boss. This game is also very unoptimized.

Everything in this game seems to be more like a random GMod workshop map, random floating blocks everywhere, specially in Update 3.

Sonic Forces has better physics and levels than this game...

Not recommended at full price.",,

"Repetitive combat, stiff controls, being stopped by pop-up tip menus every 5 seconds, and very odd graphical choices makes this yet another disappointing entry for a 3D sonic games. The characters feel hollow and Sonic's English voice acting sounds like he's aged to a dispassionate 45 year old man. Sega will do anything to avoid making Sonic Adventure 3 I guess.",,
"There's alot to like here and alot to dislike here, as is with most sonic games they're made to cater to the fans who have played for ages. The times for S rank and A rank are a tad obnoxious especially on starting levels, hitting B is my top after 10 tries and feeling like I did well only to get B rank cosecutivelty. The Cutscenes look downright awful which is sad since the world looks decent, looking akin to a unity game with grainy rain. The combat is average, nothing wild but not bad per se, the music on the other hand is great reminding me of cyberpunk. Overall it falls into the same category as any sonic title, buy it 50% off. This is a big step in the right direction for team sonic however I would like to see a lot more for the casual sonic player. Being dropped almost immediately into a high speed track right off the bat felt incredibly jarring and cheap, taking me back to prior sonic games where the team seems to struggle with a simple tutorial chapter.",,
"Its sonic, is it an AMAZING game? not by a long shot, it gets boring stupid quick, and all the new * abilities * are kinda stupid A.F

But if you're into stupid, and like mediocrity. This game is Very much up your alley!

"The fact that they still update this game a year later to patch up some issues (as best as they can), and released a Free DLC (Update 3) with loads of content is really commendable.

Overall, if this is a taste of what's to come in the future, then I'm very excited. Hopefully Sonic Team can continue on this momentum, cause they've really got something going on here - and I'm loving it. Great stuff.",,
"Sonic Frontiers made me cry. It made me scream, it made me feel that childish joy that I once had when I was a wee lad.

I've been a Sonic fan for the longest time, my first introduction to the series being Sonic Adventure, playing through the original genesis games and remember getting so hyped to play as Hyper Sonic in Sonic 3 and Knuckles. This game absolutely reminded me what it is to truly love games and to just enjoy living in the moment.

Sure, Sonic hasn't had the best games in recent years, *ahem* Sonic Forces *ahem*, and people say that Sonic has never had a good transition into 3D, despite Sonic Adventure 1 and 2 being really good games, but this game, this game is seriously beyond any other Sonic game to date, the soundtrack is absolutely god-tier, and don't get me started on the boss fights!

Now, I'm not saying that it's perfect, it definitely isn't, there are glitches and bugs but that doesn't stop me from enjoying the game, and anybody who says that they make the game unplayable is simply a hater who doesn't want Sonic to succeed. This is the direction that Sonic Team should definitely continue going through no matter what, there's so many positive reviews already on it, overwhelmingly positive reviews!

It's definitely in my top 10 favourite games of all time list, and is absolutely my personal Game of the Year.",,
"This game was honestly great. The large islands really benefit Sonic's speed as you can just keep running. Music was amazing and the combat was actually pretty enjoyable. I don't know if it was my experience playing 3D Sonic games, but getting 100% (excluding maxing out Sonic's stats and the shadow rush challenge) wasn't that time consuming. But what stood out the most was the story. Lots of references to previous titles made it feel like a good ""start of a new era"" type of story. A lot of the character moments felt almost reflective as it feels like a start for them to develop into characters independent from just, ""Guardian of the Master Emerald"" and ""Sonic's Little Brother"", even Eggman felt more like a character than just villain (although this was after reading eggman's logs from the fishing minigame which was honestly a nice break). The only complaint I have is that the ending gameplay felt a little weak. But hey, this is a rather new take on Sonic games and I'm honestly hear for it, both the storywriting and gameplay.
[Not a professional reviewer. Rather casual fan of the franchise but it was a very big part of my childhood]",,
"The lack of imagination and frustrating controls waste the promising premise of an open world sonic game.
It is at its best when you are speeding across the map, until the physics goes wonky or you fly out of control.

The best thing is the writing and dialogue, but shackled to a collection system to unlock you can mostly skip by fishing with Big and buying the relevant tokens.
The Five maps (actually 4 really) present an open space of obstacles in a fast paced playground to bounce around start strong but soon show they have nothing really special to show you. I could excuse the reuse of Sonic generations stages for the classic sections if the open world wasn't so ordinary, a grassland with grey rocks, a desert with brown rocks, an ash covered wasteland with black rocks, back to the grass land and its grey rocks again.
You'd better like Green Hill, Chemical plant, Sky sanctuary and radical highway because that's all your getting, four themes over and over and over for the 'cyber space' sections.
The skill system is not worth talking about at all as it is also mostly skipable by fishing with Big.

Digital deluxe is not worth it at all, you trip over the items its give you making them redundant, the artbook and soundtrack are a separate .exe rather them image or music files I cant look at separately.

----------

Tried the Another path 'side content' its not a new ending for the game, but side story ending.
The controls are still a problem, now Amy Tails and Knuckles are on the same last island of the game with a load of boxes scattered around and all stats back to 0 and with the frustration of going through a gauntlet to a pickup only for it to be pickup that character cannot pick up ""shoulda' done that path with Knuckles, sorry!""",,
"I have finally beat Sonic Frontiers and here are positives and negatives:

Positives:

+ I like that this one is actually having solid platforming parkours that utilizes risk and reward like taking the risk of falling down for going fast but rewarded for being quick
+Vocal themes are just amazing
+There are some old game references that feels nice to hear
+Titan bosses are pretty cool
+Controls are solid most of the time
+Sage best girl
+I like older sounding Sonic

Negatives:

-Lack of momentum feels painful in a game thats supposed to have open grounds
-The story is so non-sensical and mind numbingly boring
-The game has like no art direction at all. It feels like devs made the entire thing on unity within 2 years instead of 5. Everything is put together in such unnatural way that it just looks awkward
-While older sounding is better for Sonic, other characters feel worse to hear because of that
-Wall running is the most underutilized mechanic in the entire game. There are like max 3 good wall running obstacles and thats it
-The game has only 3 themes for worlds and they are grass, desert and lava and they all are so boring
-Final boss was so underwhelming and overly corny
-Constant pop-ins is a pain
-Cyberspace stages are all re-used levels designs and themes
-There are like no towns, npcs, unique buildings, closed areas like dungeons. Its all just floating rails
-OST is pretty weak besides the vocal themes
-Sometimes some tiny ground objects may kill your speed or ruin your cyloop while boosting, thats pretty annoying
-Randomly getting stuck in 2d sections without having an option to escape from it is pain
-Parry requires no timing, you just hold the button and it does that automatically. Pretty lame
-Having the map that reveals itself so randomly and blocky with almost always leaving a block or two inside a revealed area is extremely irritating and messy. Its especially so OCD triggering

Overall it was fun enough but extremely flawed. Like yeah, at least its better than Forces but its still almost mediocre. Idk when they'll just take serious steps and fix repeating issues with the series but honestly idc much about it either. At least it was fun enough, I already have a lot of Sonic games that I consider good so I'm not gonna whine about it. And I'm actually happy that most of the fans are liking it even if I think its kinda mid

Final score: 7/10",,
"All of the unscripted content is great! I love running around in the open world and exploring.

However, all the traditional platforming segments, and boss fights are very poor. All bosses happen as Super Sonic, so you’re always timed, and there are no checkpoints so if you make a mistake, which you will because the bosses are super flashy and are in a different style than the main game. You’ll have to start over or look up a walkthrough. The physics handle differently in the traditional levels, so all those levels feel strange and flouty.

Another problem is the technical issues. I never crashed but the pop in and low quality movies really draw you out of the game.

Open world Sonic is a great idea and I think it works well in theory, the just didn’t bring the polish.",,
"I've played through all the game, got all the achievements and I, big Sonic fan, cannot recommend this game. It's generic. Without a soul. Doesn't feel like Sonic. You could replace the protagonist with any other character without any changes. Level design is TERRIBLE, navigating on island(s) is frustrating. Also, remember that long established cute little creatures (Chaos) from this universe that hasn't been used in a while? Yeah, they're not here, they gave us generic ""cute"" little irritating creatures instead.

First boss was quite fun though. It became bland and visually unclear later, I couldn't tell what was really happening on the screen. This game is not worth its full price.

It has good moments, good ideas but the outcome seems forced, made without any passion. Story isn't good either. And the ""character animations"" in cutscenes... They feel like poorly made SFM clips. Sonic Riders realeased in 2006 has better cutscenes than this.

Frontiers seems rushed, unfinished, empty. Some good ideas are buried under poor execution. Shame, it's really sad",,

"Easily the best Sonic game released in recent years. It feels good to play, the writing is good , and the soundtrack is outstanding. If this is the future for Sonic, I am all for it.

With that said, I do have a handful of issues with this game:

1) The pop-in is egregious. Some of the worst I've ever seen.
2) The side story cutscenes feel cheap. They're not THAT bad, but it would be nice if they were improved.
3) The game is very easy. Even on Hard, the game is really easy. Minus the DLC, that can be very hard at times.
4) The writing felt like ""Hey remember this/that?"" at a point. I love the feeling of continuity the writing provides, but at a point it feels like they're mentioning past characters and events so often that it feels forced.

Regardless, if you're a fan of Sonic or want a solid game to play, I highly recommend buying Sonic Frontiers.

April 16, 2023: Got around to 100%ing the game on Extreme difficulty and it was fun. The Boss Rush and Cyberspace Stage Rush were a joy to play and perfect. The one thing I'm disappointed about from the recent update is the fact it's missing a lot of beloved songs. Understandable, but still upsetting nonetheless. Upon fighting The End again, I take back what I said about it being bad. I get it now.

October 3, 2023: I finished Final Horizon a couple hours ago. I respect their decision to make it difficult, but it was overtuned and downright cruel in some places, at least for Extreme. With that said, I DO NOT recommend playing the DLC on Extreme. It is far too punishing in an unfair way that will waste a lot of your time for no gain. Play it on one of the base game difficulties and when it gives you trouble (it will) you have the ability to turn down the difficulty. You're unable to do that on an Extreme difficulty save, so I had to download a mod to make the parry 1-second across all difficulties. Besides that, Amy and Tails are fun to play, but Knuckles is not. His glide feels awful to use and his platforming segments tended to be the least fun. The music is great, as to be expected. The lore is phenomenal. I listened to every character conversation and paid attention to every cutscene. The new final fight seems fine, but I had to cheese it since I was on Extreme and didn't want to re-fight Supreme 20 different times. The cyberspace levels were alright, nothing too exciting. Overall, the gameplay was mixed, but I enjoyed everything else. With this DLC, I can confidently say that Sonic Frontiers is worth the $60 price tag. If it goes on sale, absolutely pick it up.",,
"This is a review coming from a long-time Sonic fan:
I really liked this game! Sonic Frontiers is a massive step in the right direction for Sonic Team after the mediocre Lost World and unbearably dull Forces. The talented Unleashed/Generations team is no longer working for Sonic Team (and hasn't been for a while), but this is the first game since then that actually feels like it has some direction and passion to it.
The game is not quite ""open-world"" a-la Breath of the Wild, but instead is more like very large, sprawling levels akin to Super Mario Odyssey with the ""Cyberspace"" sub-levels placed within. The devs refer to it as ""open-zone"", and I think its the real meat of the game, and definitely the best part of the game. Its a blast to speed through the open fields, speed through obstacle courses to collect tokens to progress in the story, and I personally enjoyed the puzzles to open up the map layout, even if they were mostly easy.
The cyberspace levels are traditional Sonic stages that are something like half-reused level layouts, and half-original. Personally I do not mind the asset reuse as the cyber levels help shake up the game's pacing and adds variety to the game.
Also, there is fishing and its actually fun, and probably the most polished part of the game, humorously.
Sonic Frontiers also has Sonic control genuinely well, probably the first time since Sonic Adventure 1. He is not twitchy at high speeds like SA2 or Heroes, but he's also nimble when moving slowly unlike Unleashed/Colors/Generations. You can always have the controls adjusted to your liking, however they do not apply to cyberspace levels.
Visually the game can look both great and dull at the same time, it really depends on the time of day and environments you are in.
Music is great, like all Sonic games.
The story also deserves some praise as its the first time in a long time that the story isn't unbearably cringe. Its serious like the Adventure games, but its voice acted decently, so I'd honestly go as far as to say its probably the least cringe a Sonic story has ever gotten. It also lacks the sense of adventure that the SA games had, so hopefully a sequel can follow up on that, because there is serious potential.
The only real issue with Frontiers, and arguably the most divisive aspect of the game, is the complete lack of polish for the gameplay. The gameplay is extremely jank, with Sonic frequently either glued to the ground or flying in a straight line in the air at 100mph if he hits a rock, and the combat feels extremely floaty and odd until you get used to it. This game doesn't feel rushed, more just that the engine they used genuinely doesn't work well with Sonic's typical gameplay. And additionally the pop-in is atrocious, but I'm sure everyone has heard that already.
However, I think if you can look past the jank, theres an incredibly fun game to enjoy.
I'd personally give it an 8/10 and I think most people who are saying it sucks are being way too hard on it. Its really not bad at all aside from polishing issues. Its quite great!
Also Sonic Team better actually follow up and improve on this, with more of a structured story and connected environments and more polish, a sequel in this style would genuinely be something special. There's serious potential here.",,
"The soul of a AAA game but the body of a tech demo

Despite all the jank and the frustration this game gave me (last act cough cough) the highs of this game more than make up for it in my opinion.

I'll never forget the feeling of fighting the first titan or just doing dumb stufff in the islands.

Critically speaking the game is a 7/10, but as a Sonic fan this brings me nothing but hope for the future of the series.",,
"Writing this upon finishing Sonic Frontiers in hard mode.

Let me start by saying that this game is fantastic, and very much worth purchasing for the following reasons:
- Open-Zone environment. The game really shines here - it is a ton of fun running around and exploring the islands.
- The combat. It's no DMC, but it is very well done. There is a pretty good variety to the enemies, and Sonic's moveset is a lot of fun to use.
- The story. Wonderfully done, and had me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire playthrough. I took the time to complete every side interaction to get the greatest amount of lore possible.
- The music. Fantastic soundtrack. Enough said.

However, there are some issues that stop this game from being truly great, and they are as follows:
- The over-reliance on 2D sections. These are a crutch, ESPECIALLY when used in the open-zone areas. Thankfully they aren't used too much here (except on Island 3).
- The over-reliance on springs, dash pads, rails, etc. Sonic has a beautiful moveset, and to see more natural environmental interaction with it would be fantastic and very satisfying. Instead, traversal is often done via these other elements.
- The true final boss. This one *really* gets me. The whole story, the lore is building up to what Sonic has to face at the end. Power-scaling statements are even made with reference to the previous games, and so, I was hyped to fight whatever the final boss was going to be, given the standard set by the Titan fights. And what we actually got was... utterly lackluster. You can basically tell they ran out of development time, and had to throw something in there last minute. Please Sega, patch in a true final boss fight on par with the Titan fight!
-- Also (*minor spoiler*), missed opportunity to use the Super Emeralds... I really thought the story was going there.
- No ability to re-play the Titan fights without another play through. Had a I known, I would've saved before the fights. Again, seems like something that could be addressed with a simple patch.

Overall, had a blast, and am looking forward to playing it more!",,
SONIC IS BACK! SEGA DELIVERED,,
"Pretty fun to play, which is already a thousand time more than i hoped considering the last 15 years of the series.",,
"This game is probably my favorite Sonic game of all time!
Sonic Frontiers is just amazing.

The soundtrack is outstanding, the environment looks nice and the controls are pretty solid and customizable, but for an even better experience i would recommend physic mods, there are quite a few on Gamebanana. (I personally use Tracker's Physics Tweaks.)
On that note be sure to check out Gamebanana often for mods that might enhance/change your experience.

I really hate that Denuvo is in the PC version, there is no reason this game should have Denuvo (Sonic Mania also had Denuvo on launch and making the executable 400 MB instead of 4 MB), hopefully it will get removed soon.

but other than that, this game gets a definitely a strong 9/10 from me!

Update:
The Final Horizon was a pretty alright addition to Sonic Frontiers. The mutliple playable characters are nice but they all have some flaws, same with the ""new"" Ouranos island.
The new final boss fight and Cyberspace stages are awesome and definitely a big highlight for me!

The update did break mods, however most of the major ones work again!
So please, play this game with mods and HMM codes, they are awesome.",,

boring and mid,,
Good great awesome outstanding amazing!,,
The open world aspect is interesting but doesn't fit for a character like Sonic. The individual stages are too much like rehashes from previous games.,,
"This game is really weird. Clearly they're trying to do something new and exciting with the franchise, and the core gameplay loop and exploration is honestly pretty enjoyable, but the whole thing just feels so janky and incoherent. Nearly every area of the game desperately needs some TLC; it's blowing my mind that the reviews are generally quite positive. My gripes, in no particular order:

- The open world feels like a cheap UE4 demo -- low-quality, generic-looking terrain; poor foliage effects; and puzzles and enemies seemingly randomly sprinkled throughout the landscape. It really does feel like a fan-made demo at times.

- The camera jitters around oddly when you run (especially when not boosting), making it harder to see where you're going.

- Sometimes the boost button just doesn't work. I haven't figured out why.

- The soundtrack is a strange mix of generic-sounding piano and anime music, with no clear unifying themes or characteristics.

- The plot has yet to provide anything beyond ""you're Sonic and you have to defeat Eggman and save your friends, and oh by the way there's a strange mysterious anime lady in every other shot"".

- The UI feels unintuitive -- it's not something I can really put my finger on, but there are just a ton of little things that don't make practical sense from my perspective as a user. Everything's there (except for some more in-depth graphics settings, but welcome to PC gaming), it's just not where it should be. I know that's not helpful or constructive at all, but it's how I feel.

- A LOT of this game feels like the devs really liked Breath of the Wild, but just took some of the surface-level elements from it without understanding the core design philosophies that made that game so brilliant. Nothing wrong with borrowing elements from other games, I just don't think they borrowed the right stuff.

In general, this game just feels super unpolished. It's not devoid of any redeeming qualities -- again, exploration and combat is pretty fun, the bosses so far have been good, and the cyberspace levels are a neat challenge. I may even complete the rest of the game. I just think it's a shame that the devs either A) weren't given the time they needed to polish things up, or B) simply didn't recognize the need.",,
"I really wanted to love this game because it felt like Sega had made a slow step towards the Adventure formula which is my favorite. Unfortunately, the game feels like a parody titled ""sonic but randomly souls-like"". The hub area of the world, which is a as significant portion of the gameplay as the stages, is completely lifeless in color and barren in content. It's just dull grass everywhere with enemies scattered around, and repetitive and unimaginative parkour challenges. It takes itself too seriously and it just doesn't work out in the end, neither through gameplay nor cringe cutscenes.",,

Dookie game alert.

If this was not a Sonic game, nobody would defend this unpolished mess. The ONLY positive thing about this game is the soundtrack. Everything else (the story, the combat, the platforming, the puzzles, the exploration, the cyberspace stages) feels janky, uninspired, unpolished, and passionless (same as always). To charge $60 for this is just plain disconnected from reality.

I understand functional games are a rarity for the Sonic series. So, I get that it can be exciting to receive a game that actually runs as intended for once. However, please stop pretending this is an acceptable product from SEGA. Also, this game is butt ugly. ""It needed to run on the Switch"" is a terrible argument because there are plenty of switch games with decent visuals.

Save yourself some time/money and just play some fan games instead of this garbage.

"Sonic Frontiers is one of THE games ever made!

Overall, I recommend buying this game, especially if you're already a starved Sonic fan, assuming you still give a ♥♥♥♥ about this series somehow. If you're not already a fan, perhaps wait for a sale. I do believe £50 is pricey when you compare this title to similar games both on and outside of Steam. Just keep your expectations in check. The high points are amazing, but man do the lows suck ass.

In a number rating, I'd just BARELY give this game a 7/10. It would be a 6 if not for the context that this is the first GOOD 3D Sonic game in over a DECADE now, and I greatly respect Sonic Team for actually having some ambition like the old days. Despite 5 years of development, it is clear they had many troubles making this after needing to scrap everything and start over. This game IS unfinished, it's obvious especially later in the game, but despite everything, I still love, and more importantly, respect what this game turned out to be in the end, again given the greater context of Sonic's game history.

Here's a rough list of things I liked and didn't like from the top of my head, some points include spoilers:

-- Liked --
- The writing is some of the best in the series. Nothing groundbreaking for the writing world, but for Sonic it's a massive step up. There are various scenes in the world where he can talk with his friends in ways you'd actually believe to make sense. Crazy! I do wish more was happening during these moments outside of just standing around and talking, but it's a start.

- The boss fights. With the exception of the final 2, they rule. Don't spoil yourself on them. Just play them.

- I do believe the combat is serviceable, I just wished for something more involved.

- The music. No ♥♥♥♥ the music is amazing, it's Sonic. Again I must point to the boss fights as those tracks go HARD. It's ridiculous but I love it.

- A lot of people don't like these, but I actually liked the Cyberspace levels overall, but I would change a lot about them. I think S ranks need to be FAR harder to achieve, the red rings should actually take effort to find, and the controls should be IDENTICAL to the open world controls. For some reason, Sonic's physics are completely different in Cyberspace in all the worst ways. I understand why they are disliked, primarily for the fact they are in every way WORSE than Unleashed and Generations levels, but I still had plenty of fun with these. Still better than Forces lmao.

- Fishing! :D

- There's a lot of sections where you'll be playing some kind of mini-game to beat a challenge. Random world challenges do this and so do some guardian fights. Some will likely hate this but I ended up really enjoying it, with the exception of one instance seen in the dislikes list. Overall is really reminds me of Nier Automata.

-- Disliked --
- The open world level design is bland and boring. Still fun to run around in, but I'm not a fan of the massive disconnect between the world geometry and all the random rails and boosters everywhere. It just looks kinda bad and doesn't make any sense.
- On the topic of the open worlds, Chaos Island, the third island in the game. It. Is. BAD. The game often locks you into predefined paths that are more like traditional Sonic platforming challenges. That's what those rails and springs are. But it's HORRIBLE in Chaos Island. Hard to see, or outright HIDDEN booster pads sending you in a completely different direction, locking you into a 2D section you can't escape from, and when you try to frantically get out, you hit ANOTHER one. It's not this bad for the other worlds, Chaos Island is just by far the worst in the game. The boss rules though.

- Graphical issues. The game ran fine for me, but the pop in is awful. I was hoping for an option to reduce it on PC but n o p e. It very often disrupts gameplay too, as platform challenges RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU can sometimes not load in visually, so you can't see where you need to go. Remember you travel quite fast in this game too. Not a good mix as you can imagine.

- Invisible walls. WHY????? Open world game locking off large chunks of the map for no reason. OK.

- Ignore this point if you REALLY want to see the true final boss completely blind, but it sucks ass anyway so you shouldn't care tbh. The final boss is awful. Minor gameplay spoiler here, not story related. The gameplay of the true final boss is nothing like the rest of the game. You go from Sonic to TouHou for no reason at all. I like bullet hell shoot-em-ups, but ♥♥♥♥ this. It isn't even cool to look at. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SPHERE. Not to mention the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ monologue it goes on every time you fight it, and if you lose, back to the beginning! It's long and annoying and uninteresting as hell. Terrible way to end the game when you have so many kickass Titan fights.

- This game's physics are janky as hell. I fairly often clipped through the geometry of some guardians and titans. Sonic just randomly decides whether he feels like sticking to the floor like a magnet, or just being launched into the air. The wall running sections are extremely inconsistent. Sometimes he sticks automatically, sometimes you need to hold the boost button just to run normally, sometimes the boost actually boosts and launches you off the wall, sometimes Sonic doesn't even move in the direction you input. Then there's the issue of Cyberspace having different physics entirely, so the skills learned in the world don't apply. It's just a mess.

- This game has a parry move. It's lame. You hold both bumper buttons with no timing needed. It also does this annoying thing where it slows time. How is that annoying? There's a guardian fight later on that you MUST parry to beat, but when you do, you're just stuck waiting for it's next move because you can't attack it while in that phase. Repeat until it finishes it's phase. It's just lame design that feels completely untested.

- You can level up Sonic's stats, but they take WAY too long. Speed and Ring levels can only be increased ONE AT A TIME using LAGGY menus. It will literally take around 30 minutes to max them out just using the UI alone. Who thought this was a good idea?

- The UI in general is just laggy. You need to wait for the game to allow you to select and press a button it presents. There seems to be some arbitrary delay on these actions for some reason.

- There's a big issue that comes up in the story that goes absolutely nowhere and is resolved in the exact same scene it became a problem with no real stakes at play.

- There's a pinball challenge I really hated but I just hate pinball tbh.

- The story cutscenes are just kinda lame. It's all just standing and talking.

- I know for a fact there's more to this list but I can't think of them right now. May edit later.

Overall, a good game with many issues as said at the start. Just keep your expectations in check and you'll probably have a good time. For once, I'm actually more of a glass half-full guy in this scenario. There's a lot wrong with this game, but it gets quite a lot right, and when playing I felt like the good outweighed the bad just enough.",,
"I uninstalled and requested a refund for this game. The overworld is entirely boring, the minibosses are uninteresting. I did a side mission where I had to draw a circle to destroy weeds. That was it.

The only good mission was mission 1-2 (The missions are replays of levels from old games but shortened and every red ring is on your path) which took me a fair few tries to S-rank but other than that, I accidentally S-ranked every other mission I tried first time.

Mission 1-7 was completely devoid of structures. I completed the mission and got all 4 keys on my first try and I didn't even have floor to walk on, the world was empty. Sonic is not supposed to be this easy that I can S-rank a mission using only obstacles, enemies and spin bars due to the entire world glitching and not loading.

I had 4 hours play time due to the amount of times the game glitched and I had to restart and it's nothing to do with my computer, it's just SEGA not realising that the best game they've released in this millennium was Sonic Generations and Sonic Mania (Which I don't even think was SEGA). Awful product

EDIT:

Since I couldn't get the refund for this game, I refused to let it go to waste and decided to just play it. I can't. I'm on the 2nd world and fought a shark miniboss at which I homing attack his tail then press left, right or down while it surfs around the sand. then after enough I can bash attack until it died as it lay there helpless.

I have to collect 88 more knuckles medals to help him and for a game where you're the fastest thing alive, this game does everything it can to stop you in your tracks every 35 yards.

If you're looking for a game where 90% of the enemies involve you running a circle around them then bashing attack until they do or if you like running around vast open worlds for 4.8 seconds before stopping to do a mission that gives you 55 seconds to circle an object that turns into a wall you can run up for you to run up in with 48 seconds to spare, this game is for you.

As for me, I'll take the £35 hit because I'd prefer to pay £35 to never play what I would consider to be the worst Sonic game I've ever played. I'll go back to Sonic 06. at least that's so bad that it's funny.

TL;DR - Don't buy this game, it's the worst thing, ever.",,

"I don't get it. There's obviously a fun game here with crazy potential, but the game actively goes out of it's way to take control from the player.
You would think you're getting a full blown sandbox game to run about in and find really fun ways to traverse the area with high speed. Sadly this is not the case.
There's also Sonic levels sprinkled into this which are just copy pasted elements from Sonic Generations levels that don't play as well as they did in the original game.
Grab this game cheap if you absolutely must but these devs still have a long way to go.

"The best 3D Sonic game we've had for a while. While some parts still feel like they could use some work, as a whole, this game is a fantastic experience for Sonic fans. Here's the things I liked the most:
- The characters are FINALLY written properly for once, making me actually invested in the story. Some of the arcs they go through can hit pretty hard.
- The movement in this game is nice and customizable and we finally get other characters to play as after all these years.
- What probably needs no introduction, is this game's AWESOME soundtrack. This is the most satisfying iteration of Super Sonic that this series has gotten.",,

"It is a 9/10 in my opinion! Amazing game compared to sonic forces.

This game is going to feel slow at first for about the first 30 minutes to an hour, but then you will start leveling up your stats and you will start to go a lot faster. This game has my favorite soundtrack, great game play, beautiful graphics, love the open world, awesome story, the super sonic boss fights, etc. I could talk about this game all day!

The only flaws this game has is that the open world feels a little repetitive at times, the cyberspace levels are literally zones from older sonic games that we have seen a billion times; I would fix this by making the cyberspace levels have unique new zones and level design overall.

Overall, this game is outstanding 9/10! So worth the $60 if your a sonic fan! (although maybe if your not much of a sonic fan but still want a good and fun game, then I would recommend waiting for a sale) With all the beautiful graphics, game play, story, just how it is overall! It is an open world sonic game that you will definetly be spending a ton of hours on!

Hopefully they iron out some of the more frustrating parts (I'm looking at you speed and ring leveling) so maybe wait a bit, or wait until it's on sale. but overall, I've really enjoyed the experience.",,
"I'm having fun with it, but can't recommend to many people since the game is pretty bad and just following the open world hype train as sega likes to do. if they try to build on this it might make a better next game.

it's like playing Sonic Adventure on the dreamcast with janky movement physics at times and the level portals, and how pretty much everything is a scripted cutscene/event. The only difference is better graphics and music and the fact it was released in 2022.",,
"Just what the series needed.

The gameplay is a huge improvement from Forces but could be something truly great in a future title with a good base structure around momentum-based platforming. The open worlds are really good as they are with the weakest of them being chaos island, which I believe with momentum-based physics would have made it one of the most fun to play through as you could use the terrain to cross the gaps and have a satisfying way to traverse the map.

Cyberspace leaves me in a weird spot as I don't hate it but I also don't love it. The controls being different to the open world isn't the best and with most of them reusing level layouts from previous games doesn't fully help that as well as having the level themes be from green hill, sky sanctuary, and chemical plant. These for me make the stages lack an iconic feel like you could with previous stages in the series. The city design is nice because it acts as an amalgamation of all the previous city levels mashed into one, This type of design could have made having older themes done with a unique twist making them more refreshing to see. some examples of this could be: Green hill mixed with seaside hill and emerald hill zone. chemical plant mixed with Eggman land and metropolis zone. sky sanctuary mixed with Babylon garden and sky road.

The story being pinned by Ian Flynn leads to the characters being characterized as they should be since (for sonic at least) Sonic and the Black Knight, which was in 2009. The extra depth to weave elements from different games through the dialog was nice to see with references to games like S3&K SA1, SA2, Heroes, Shadow the hedgehog, Unleashed, Colours, Lost World, Forces, sonic riders team sonic racing, even one line to reference the idw comics which is nice to see.

Overall, the game is not perfect but it does show a lot of promise for the future and on its own was a really fun time to play all the way through despite some jank that occurred throughout the game and the pop-in issues.

Just like with Generations, I'm excited to see what the community does with mods and custom stages to fully test the capabilities of the game.",,

"There is so much to unpack here... While I did like the game, I cannot recommend it at it's current state (doubt there'll be patches to fix this issues tho).

I do think this game is a step in the right direction for Sonic franchise, game is fun to play and story is decent. But at a price point of an AAA game ($60 atm) you would expect SO much more of the game. For me, Generations was the peak and we could go from there. But for whatever reason, Sega didn't seem to learn from the positives from that game and screwed it up yet again.

Sonic is super slow, even at Max Speed Level, unless you use the boost. Stats? They're worthless in the cyberspace levels and controls there suck. The boost which was supposed to make you go faster through some parts of the stage, barely increase your end speed. Also there is no momentum in jumping, making your jump capabilities sufferable. Remember the pause after homing attacks we had in '06? It's back and instead of fighting enemies your fastest route is to avoid them as much as you can.

A lot of times you're just trying to get somewhere in the map and then suddenly a speed booster on the ground takes you off of your route and suddenly locks you in a 2D section which you have to get creative to get out without completing the section. Not to mention there are various weird moments when doing 2D sections, like Sonic suddenly going downwards on a wall when you're pressing up or when you think just a booster is enough to get you through a loop but if you stop holding forward, Sonic almos immediately stops, like the boost is completly worthless.

Boss fights are a joke, even on hard mode. Mini-bosses just get annoying when you're trying to walk around and by accident trigger a cutscene that engages them and you have to boost away to lose aggro. I found myself avoiding fights most of the time because it was so much better to just go chill with Big and fish for resourses.

Upgrading abilities at Elder Koco? Be ready for a very painful proccess of doing it one by one, as someone thought it would be a good idea to not let people upgrade as much as they could in a single go. How the hell does this gets approved? UX people, please help them.

And on top of all that, there are assets suddenly popping in the screen as you run around. And this was an issue even on PS5 consoles. You'd expect a game at AAA price to be able to handle this much properly. Speaking of assets, why are most of the stages based off of the same 4-5 stages all the time? The franchise has so many great stages that could have been used and reimagined. At some point I was a bit sick of seeing Green Hill stages all over. S-Rankings? Easy. Not challenging at all. Not even collecting red rings was hard.

I really wanted to write a positive review for this game, but with this much crap, I just can't. Go play Generations instead.",,
"I have a thousand nitpicks with this game, but ultimately the core gameplay of roaming around, fighting enemies and collecting stuff is just fun. It just flows incredibly well. Plus the bosses are quite sick. Still I wanna address my 2 major issues with the game, in case of them being a dealbreaker to anyone.

Firstly the game is way too easy, even on the highest difficulty. Really wouldn't have hurt to crank up time limits across the board for the hard difficulty, so you can actually feel accomplished when you beat any kind of challenge. Only a single level and a single boss (kinda) did that and those were the best parts. The only way of skill expression after those is getting collectibles in efficient, unintended ways, which can be pretty fun though.

Secondly the economy, if you wanna call it that, is pretty dumb. For some reason they thought it'd fun to have the fishing minigame be the best way to level up by far. And because you progress through collectibles, this also means that they are pretty much unlimited, making them feel worthless too. So all in all the game completely disincentivises you from enjoying its core gameplay just with a few poor decisions.

I tried my best to look beyond that, which is why this game still made for a fun 30 hours to 100% for me. Wouldn't be suprised if people who don't make this effort to simply end up hating the game for it though.",,
The most badass sonic game ever made,,
It's very good,,
4am to 10am,,
fantastic,,
after getting 100% and beating the game i can say that this game is well worth your money,,
"Honestly this game is pretty good!! For most people, this game might be a 7/10 or 8/10 game, but for me, a Dark Age fan, this game is an 9.5/10",,
"Lifeless and empty
Tries hard to be like Zelda: Breath of the Wild but just has no soul to it
Feels more like playing Death Stranding or Nier Autiomata than it does a Sonic game",,
"I think this in my honest opinion is a very enjoyable and fun game, I like the many ways of getting memory tokens for each character, It feels like you need to get them in a set pathway but honestly that isn't true, due to how Sonic feels you can get them anyway you can! also the music and bosses feel really fun to fight and do",,
"Sonic Frontiers is one of the greatest Sonic games of all time.

The open-zone maps all felt very good to explore. They were the perfect size; they didn't feel too big or too small. The challenges around the islands were fun to find and complete. The islands contain token items that are needed to progress through the story. These can be found through various platforming challenges on the islands. These platforming challenges all felt great to complete.

The cyberspace levels play like traditional Sonic levels. Some of the levels are near-identical copies of levels from past Sonic games like Sonic Adventure 2 and Sonic Generations. The cyberspace levels have some additional missions that can lead to different rewards: find all five red rings, clear the stage with a certain amount of rings, and beat the stage under a certain time. Overall, I felt like the cyberspace levels were too short; most of them can be beaten in under a minute, and the longest ones are only around 2 minutes long.

The combat was very good. Sonic has a skill tree that lets him learn new attacks that can be used on the enemies. The different attacks can be more beneficial to use in some circumstances than other attacks. For example, if some enemies are grouped together, it would be better to use an attack that can hit multiple enemies at a time. Finding the mini-bosses around the islands and figuring out how to beat them was always a good experience. The mini-bosses all have different ways to defeat them, so figuring out their weaknesses is a good challenge.

The boss fights were all well-designed. The bosses amplified the great aspects of the combat. Every boss was fun to fight against. It's hard to mention anything else about the bosses without spoilers, so I'll stop discussing the bosses here.

The music in the game is perfect. The soundtracks selected for the open-zone islands were all very fitting for each island's theme. These tracks even change as you progress through the story, so they don't become stale after hours of playing. The music selected for the cyberspace levels are fast-paced, and they reflect Sonic's speed perfectly. The choices for the vocal tracks were all perfect to represent the in-game events when they are played.

The only other problems I had with the game contain spoilers, so I won't mention them here.

Overall, Sonic Frontiers is a great game, and I would recommend it if you like open-world games.",,
"Best Sonic game yet. I absolutely love it, it's probably my new favorite game. The OST is of course amazing, but this time the music is so insanely hype that it will most likely give someone over 50 a heart attack. Exactly my kind of music. These boss themes make me feel like I could do anything. I found myself literally looking forward to the big boss fights, just to hear their theme.

Only problem I got is that having to use the cyloop to break enemy shields, really breaks the flow of combat. It is super satisfying otherwise though.

The 2D sections make you much slower, so you can actually know whats coming up without memorizing the level layout.

The characters also reference basically all the older games. So it feels conneted to the rest of the franchise, without reusing Green Hill for 25.000.000th time. Even though they do that, but only in cyberspace. That's fine though, because the levels are fun.

If you liked any of the other Sonic games, you'll most likely enjoy this one.",,

"this just put sonic above mario for me.
Mario has strong competition in the movie department already and this game absolutely thwamps mario odyssey. if sonic keeps it up, Mario might not be the star of plat phormers anymore.
this game has some similar issues, but arcade mode is a real saver.
id love to see a feature like that in Mario Odyssey, but sadly that game makes you kick rocks for moons.
nothing that stupid and boring here, though there is some monotony its still far better than Mario Oddysee and im sure Sage wont take 7 years to make the sequel like nintendo does with 3d mario titles.
it took a long time for sonic to get on his feet again, but honestly it blows past mario now.

THE MOVIES
wow Sonic is having its 3rd movie and they have all been really good so far.
Mario just barely got over himself to try that again 30 years later and boy it looks really bad.
unlike Sonic, Mario never took the risk of developing there 1 denominational characters.
there's no hope that the Mario movie will be much more than a funny mind ♥♥♥♥, id be serprised if they even do anoither Mario film, but we will see.

The Music.
both have always had such good music, but were as Mario is still just funny fun.
sonic has stayed genuinely good while introducing much more music genre over the years.

The Bad
Sonic was pumping out some hot turds for what felt like forever, but to be honest as a Mario fan i haven't even liked a game in 10 years, last time i was complacently happy with a Mario game was Galaxy2.
Sonic was doing much better by the time we had sequels to the racing games before Sonic Team Racers ♥♥♥♥ the bed wich is sad, but Mario has been milking the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Mario Kart for 10 years.

its not by much, but as of now Sonic is ahead of Mario and i don't see the current lazy aass attempts from Nintendo putting out anything too great for a long time.",,
"I'm a long time Sonic fan having tried his best and worst outings over the years and this has got to be one of the worst I've yet played. This feels like a haphazardly put together open world with random things to do, confusing progression, and normal Sonic levels scattered throughout. A tedious and unnecessary combat system is also introduced. Exploring the open world can be fun and the Sonic stages definitely are fun, but the mundane tasks and mini games you have to do in order to progress the story and the awful combat (especially in boss battles) kill the experience. I’m not sure what Sonic Team was trying to do here, but it feels like they failed or more like even they didn't understand what they were trying to do. It feels like a tech demo that somehow got greenlit as a game and was forced into existence. It visually looks pretty bad too. The character models look good, but everything else, from texture work, level of detail, to art style all look heavily aged and mismatched.",,
"The game has a lot of issues, at the current price, heck even the current sale price I got it at of 33% off, hard no. It's fun but that fun is always barged aside by the janky controls, the clunky combat, the absurdly low view distance where items pop in in front of your eyes, sometimes as you land on them, and are expected to have enough time to jump/dodge the incoming hazard. It feels like a dev test or a proof of concept where a story and bosses were slapped on. The random mini games and puzzles are given no rhyme or reason than The Ancients move in mysterious ways. I've reached the third Island which appears to be halfway, and i'm 10 hours in, if this changes later then it's already too late.The game has fun, and it has potential, but pop in, bad aerial control and questionable level design for some of the open worlds mean that fun is cut short by all the annoying flaws that lie in wait, they're not always there, but then one will creep up on you again and remind you it is still there. For £15-20 go ahead, you'll get some enjoyment out of it. but for the AAA price it asks for? Definitely not.",,
"If you've been waiting for Sonic Adventure 3, well, this is Sonic Adventure 3. The story of the game is definitely one of the best the Sonic franchise has ever had. The one thing I wish the game had was Momentum, the ability to gain speed as you run, but the story and replayability of the game definitely make up for that. The Cyber Space levels in the game also kinder to the 3D Sonic games of the past, while also integrating the open world aspect beautifully. And, as always, the soundtrack is an absolute banger, probably even more so with the heavy metal tracks with the Titan boss fights. I would highly recommend picking this up, whether you're a Sonic fan or not.",,

fantastic game! 10/10,,
"Dont. Buy. I had a bunch of high hopes for this game as it had amazing looking trailers but as i played the gameplay all felt half done and for a game built around ""Going fast"" i was going incredibly slow. Sega has done the bare minimum to make the game look good, and even less to make sure the game ""Feels good"" as well. With constant pop in from assets and lighting being loaded in to the suprising LACK of voicelines you would expect, this game has proven to be utterly dissapointing. Putting in a refund.",,
"You know when a game isn't exactly perfect, but it fills you with pure joy to play?

My first concern with this game from its announcement (and the original leak from way back when that turned out to be completely accurate) was that this game's concept was too obviously cynical— ""open world game with specific inspiration from Breath of the Wild"" gave me the impression that this game would be a cynical product rather than something driven by any genuine creative vision.

Then, when the trailers were released, the game looked like a janky mess. I immediately wrote it off and figured that, at best, the game would be so bad that it was funny; at worst, it'd be mediocre and boring.

In the end this game is pure Sega. It's full of ideas, many of which are new and many of which are throwbacks. They take a kitchen sink approach and while not every element is great, it has so much that it's difficult to get bored. Underpinning everything is the ""open zone"" approach. The open levels are scattered with small platforming segments that you can 'ride', so to speak, towards your destination. There are also many bosses and enemies littering the maps, and their designs are often creative... mechanically they're a mixed bag but it's always fun to find new enemies to fight. There's a battle system involving parries and a number of unlockable moves that, to be honest, seem like a waste... most of the enemies are gimmicks and there is no real mechanical purpose to the special moves beyond perhaps style.

The game has... I think 30 different Cyberspace levels. Those are like Generations/Unleashed boost gameplay style. They feel a bit awkward compared to those two, with a really bad homing attack delay and nerfed boost, but the level design isn't bad... a few of the levels are really good. I think, taken on their own, these levels are much better than something like Colours (which I'm not a fan of tbh). As a side activity they're better than I would have expected.

There are a number of Super Sonic fights in the game. They're more about spectacle than mechanical depth, but that's no different than previous Super Sonic fights... if anything they're better and more well-executed than any other 3D Super Sonic fights. Each fight has a sick vocal theme. Whichever group/s Sega got to do these songs are real good... they lose the campy appeal of Crush40, if anything they remind of me Revengeance's songs with a little less bombast but also more quality. The second and third boss fights in particular are incredible and go way too heavy for a Sonic game.

The game delivers a really interesting backstory about the world— one that will appeal especially to long-term Sonic fans— but the story otherwise is poor. In particular, it left a lot to be desired regarding Sage and also the role of the titans. On the other hand, the writing is much better than you would expect from a Sonic game. There are some genuinely touching character moments.

Anyway. I had a more pure experience of joy playing this than I've had playing any other Sonic game for as long as I can remember. It reminds me of Sega at their peak.",,

Sonic Frontiers Breath of the Evangelion (or Breath of the Wild, Shadow of the Colossus, Evangelion)",,
Not a fan. Every mini game seems to be more fun than the main game which is just open world wandering with not very creative level design. Really struggling to see why it's rated as 'overwhelmingly positive'. Played through approx 5 hours of the first world and it was just depressing and repetitive so I abandoned it.,,
"I quite enjoyed sonic frontiers, the open zone gameplay is relatively fun and the cyber space stages are certainly there but overall it was pretty alright.
Even with the pop-in (its very noticeable at certain times) it still looks pretty good visually.

cant believe a sonic game made me feel emotions, they haven't done that since 2012",,

-running around collecting mcguffins for a dozen hours like a tired old ubisoft game with horrendus pop-in

-green hill, chem plant and sky sanctuary being 3/4 of the level themes
-your skills never being tested and being able to breeze past the game with no upgrades
-60fps lock and 30fps locked cutscenes in a game with in-engine cutscenes (there's already mods to unlock the fps so there's no reason for this) and none of the CGI cutscenes in the trailer in the actual game (seriously wtf)
-super sonic gameplay that, while cool, lack the emotional impact super sonic bosses usually come with to make way for micheal bay action with music that'd fit better in devil may cry or metal gear rising
-Denuvo, AGAIN.
Then this is the best sonic game! Sonic is back guys! 11/10, woooooo!

If you can't detect sarcasm I don't really like any of these things. I feel like SEGA has mishandled the franchise so badly and released so little content over the last 5 years that fans are now ravenous to hang onto anything to praise and protect it. I personally find this to be more of a misstep than Sonic Forces in a lot of ways honestly, at least that felt like an echo of what could've been a great sonic title and not just sonic in a tech demo. It appeals to the more average gamer so it'll be praised far more, but imo the heart of Sonic has been forgotten by Sonic Team, and if this was their best effort to recover it my hopes are lower than ever.

EDIT: Having beaten the game I'll add that Sage, the new character, is by far the only saving grace imo. Her ending song was the only time I felt any sense of the earnest emotions I'd expect from the series. If you actually want good sonic content, please go support the IDW comics and read through the metal virus arc. It far surpasses anything Sonic Team has produced since Unleashed. I heard Ian Flynn, writer on the comics, was part of writing for Frontiers but I assume he must've been brought in late or swamped by restrictions from the higher-ups to salvage this. If by the 0.001% chance SEGA read this, let the people involved in the comics write the next game story, and go back to the Adventure or Generations gameplay formula keeping the control improvements this game made, please.

Also, shoutout to the modders who overhauled and fixed a lot of the broken stuff in this game week one. If they can do it that fast why couldn't Sonic Team with the source code and 5 years of dev time. It's just embarrassing. Any playtime you see from me on this game is purely because of their efforts to turn the game into a truly fun sandbox.",,
This is genuinely one o' the most boring games I've ever ♥♥♥♥♥♥ played all you mooks who I know that gas this game up ♥♥♥♥ you,,
its so bad,,
"How can it be so bad?

I don't usually trash talk about games I play, but this one is deserved, trust me.
I was thinking that all the fuss and prediction around Sonic Frontiers being the worst episode ever was a bit over dramatic.
Let me tell you: the legend is true. This game is a pile of bugs and bad decisions.

The fact that it can be released with so many bugs just in the game menu just tells how bumpy the road must had been for the development and what to expect when in game. Crashes when just scrolling through options, no way to adjust resolution because it crashes probably just before the setting... hell I don't know, I never get that far, full screen not working, image blurry...

But I'm a nice person and we are all humans after all so mistakes can happen so I continue to the game itself.

And I mean.... what the ...?

Nothing makes sense in this game.
So, you think you can roam into the freshly discovered new land ? Bcause this is what open world is?
Naaaah. Not for Sega. For Sega open world is just a big stage selection, where you can't even go wherever you want.

Usually when such limitation happens in open worlds it's mixed within the story so well that I easily accept it, because it

Here I'm just blocked by a broken bridge with no way to work around it except for clearing the level stage that is 20 feet before.
Again, I won't talk about the story because... I mean, I bet someone out there will compile all the ingame cinematics but jesus... even movies are better.
Sega is trying so hard to surf on the Zelda wave except they all got it wrong. I mean, if you try to get close to that vibe (open world and stuff) you got to have the story to back it up and make it coherent with your gameplay decisions.
What seemed to happen here? Take trendy game style/design etc etc, mix it all together and VOILA : Sonic Frontiers.

In the end, we have a story that it's just a poor excuse for a game background, gameplay that doesn't match what was announced and more bugs than I can count.

TL;DR; It's really expensive for a pre-alpha.
Keep your money.",,
"The game appears to have been designed with the intention of emulating the style and mechanics of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. However, it becomes evident that the developers have merely attempted to imitate the visual style and gameplay elements of the original, rather than truly emulating its essence.

After two hours, the player may feel as though they have seen everything. The game has been played up to the boss Giganto. The gameplay is repetitive, with the player collecting items and nothing more.
The most egregious issue is that, if the player picks up a collectible on one of the flying rails, they are thrown forward and must return to pick up the other collectibles on one of the other flying rails. The game is essentially an Unreal Engine map with Sonic objects inserted. It is uncreative and boring. Some speedpads simply spread out on the floor.

The cyberspace levels are relatively straightforward and brief. As far as I am aware, they also tend to utilise the same three or four designs. One of these is Green Hill. Additionally, they reuse level design from previous games in cyberspace.

Sonic's speed is frustratingly slow, and the player loses momentum with each turn. All attacks, with the exception of the Cyloop, are merely cutscene attacks without any form of feedback or additional features. Fights in this game are essentially just button-mashing.

The game has too many graphical problems, particularly the popping of objects from 10 meters away, which looks rather unimpressive. The game was tested on a RTX 3080ti and Ryzen 5 5600x.

The physics are buggy, with Sonic getting stuck on the floor and walls all the time.
In the ""Tower"" boss encounter, Sonic consistently became stuck on the boss during the cycle because it was possible to climb on him.

I viewed the narrative on YouTube after I had refunded the game. At least it is superior to the content that has emerged since Sonic Colors. However, this does not imply that it is on par with the other games' narratives. It is still primarily a Sonic-centric narrative.

I can confirm that I have seen everything within two hours due to the use of copy-paste content.
It is outrageous to charge 60 euros for it.",,
"It's a very good Sonic game, and I can't quite put my finger on why I'm compelled to refund it.

I feel like a casting director sitting in front of a very talented individual and telling him that while he does have a knack for acting, and very closely fits the description for the character we want, we're still not accepting him for the role.

It's everything I thought I wanted in a Sonic game, but I'm just not impressed. Refunded.",,
"Sonic Frontiers huh? sounds pretty cool right???? yyeaaahhh, I dunno, after playing this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games for hundreds of hours, I can't really recommend it to someone...unless its for mods and whatnot.

Also, ♥♥♥♥ Chaos Island.",,
"One word: repetitive.

The core gameplay loop consists of running around a barren, boring open area with platforms and rails floating around. The entire game has this sad, lonely, dreamy, washed-out look and feel to it that's just not all that pleasant, at least to me. There's occasional combat that, while interesting at first, gets boring quickly as you learn the best moves to defeat each enemy and just repeat them every time. Controlling Sonic feels great, but the world doesn't provide anything interesting to do, or at least doesn't contextualize what's here in any interesting way. Just barren world with random platforms floating around and platforming 'challenges' that don't provide any real challenge.

Strangely enough though, you can also skip most of the platforming, since you can literally just run around in tiny circles and make the story-progressing and upgrade-unlocking pickups appear out of thin air at a decent rate. Literally. It's hardly a good alternative though, as you end up getting a choice between boring platforming and literally running in circles.
You still have to defeat bosses for unique pickups though, and complete some 'puzzles' (only one of which I actually somewhat enjoyed) to unlock routes to new places in the world.

The second part of the gameplay are regular linear stages that you enter from the open world. They're decently fun, designed to be beaten in less than a minute sometimes, making them fun to replay and master to tick all the checkboxes (rings, red rings, time). They do, however, carry over the sad washed out look of the overworld - gone are the vibrant colours and the happy-go-lucky feel of the past games. And make no mistake, the open world is not just a level select hub - you need to run around, collect stuff, complete repetitive challenges and earn your chance to play them.

To sum up, I quit halfway through, and can't force myself to play any more. I would gladly play through the linear stages and experience the story, but the thought of running around the open world and collecting random stuff just doesn't appeal to me at all.",,
"Very tedious, very repetitive game. You're better off watching a let's play of this game",,
"Not worth $60. Save your money. Takes control of your camera and throws you off of the edge of the map constantly, even with all the settings related to camera control turned off. Gameplay is poor, story is even worse.",,
"Listen man, I love Sonic but this was painful to play lmao. I knew that SEGA was mostly churning out ♥♥♥♥ Sonic games ever since SA2 but I didn't know it was this bad for Sonic fans to finally think they're eating some good food (it's not LOL).

I appreciate the hard work the devs put into this game, but their direction is all over the place. It's like they tried mashing together all the popular genres at the time and plopped Sonic right into it. You're trying to sell Dark Souls combat but there's nothing 'soulslike' about it because Sonic can just spam homing attack and dash away LMFAO. You try to appeal to BotW fans but the world is empty and all you can do is collect korok mimics (Koros???). I feel like SEGA fails to understand that Sonic is honestly literally its own genre, yet they never capitalize on it except that one time with Sonic Mania.

Also don't get me started on the unfortunate cutscenes and shoddy voice acting oh my god death

Anyways still waiting on SA3 (Shadow with guns does not count)",,
"Updating the review now that I've completed the story.

This game is surprisingly deep for a Sonic game and proof that Sega's head is in the right direction. Pretty much everything feels great in this game with only a few minor kinks to work out (camera locking in later islands, the 1-2 S rank time, challenge variety, etc) but this really is the first game in the franchise since Generations *a decade ago* that I can truly call a great game.
If I had to nitpick though, Big's Fishing Mini-game (and grilling if you have the Monster Hunter DLC) is absolutely BUSTED and can max out all of your stats as well as skip just about every stage, challenge, or secret on every island for no time flat, and there isn't really a lot of variety in the stage designs, effectively making use of about four or five designs of which all but one are taken from previous games.
Regardless, this really feels like something new and took me about 15 hours (the time of review) to see the ending, and that's with a majority of islands at about 50% completion.

I definitely believe it's worth picking up right now, even if it's just to support Sega for doing so much to make this game work despite obvious risks for such an ambitious project (especially after the lazy ""Sonic Forces"" a few years back).",,
"Sonic Frontiers is a confused project that tries to be both a 3D-platformer and an action-adventure game while failing to do either well. Sonic's controls and abilities change based on setting; Sonic plays like an action-adventure character in the open world and he plays like a platforming character in the speed stages. The speed stages play just like every other -era Sonic game, so players who enjoyed the speed stages from should be happy. However, the open world combat and gameplay are hampered by the need to keep it close to how Sonic plays in his platforming stages, resulting in a clunky hybrid of straight-line speed and combo-based combat. Ironically, open-world combat feels like a , tedious version of 's combat system. The open world isn't fun to explore because it is designed around a clunky hack-and-slash combat system instead of being built to showcase Sonic's platforming and speed mechanics.",,
"I have to say, I wanted to like this game. And in some aspects I do, the story and characterization even this early on are sublime, the open world is an interesting and fun change of pace (subjective!) from the tightly designed levels (which are also present), and I find the gameplay pretty relaxing.
So, why the thumbs down?
The game freezes. Constantly. I timed it on my most recent play and with everything else closed my WHOLE PC freezes up for up to twenty seconds, and I rarely went longer than 20 seconds without freezing. This is regardless of the settings, hardware (just got a new graphics card- it's still bad, if not somehow even worse) and various tune-ups. I'd say about an hour out my 3 hours on record was spent in the options menu and timing out freezes, it is just Awful. I honestly regret not refunding it while I still could.
Word to the wise: I heard this is an issue with Windows, and the fact this game uses Denuvo; I'm not savvy with anti-piracy software, but from what I understand the issues start there.

If you're a Sonic fan thinking of playing on Windows (and especially if you don't find the idea of an open world sonic that interesting), save the money. Buy a better optimized game and watch the cutscenes alone. I'll update with whether it plays better on Steamdeck, since that runs by default on a Linux OS. Rating subject to change in case they fix the GLARING performance issues, and/or the steamdeck port is actually playable.
There's something to be said how anti-piracy software mostly only hurts legitemate consumers. I can't recall it ever actually stopping pirates, a would-be pirate in 99% of the cases was never going to be a consumer. I love Sonic, but same as ever I fear for the future if it prioritizes *shoddy anti piracy measures* over actual game performance.",,

The cinematic transitions to the fire music ost like ""break through it all"" and ""Undefeatable"" makes this game amazing and like your fighting a real serious boss or threat.

"I wanted to like this game as a fan, it has some good ideas but it's just not well executed, the environments aren't interesting, the platforming is a bit janky, the combat is not engaging at all which makes the bosses and semi-boss encounters boring, the game rips control of the camera from you when you're exploring the world to focus on enemies or random obstacles, the story is incredibly boring.

Decent ""for a Sonic game"" but at this point that doesn't even mean anything. It just doesn't do what it's trying to do very well, the ideas are there but the execution is mediocre. I heard the game was done on a very low budget and that is apparent - but that gives me hope that with the sales and hype of this, they'll give it a proper sequel.",,

"As a diehard Sonic fan, I really wanted to like this game. To its credit, this is probably the best thing to come out of Team Sonic since Sonic Colours, but it still largely falls short of being as big of a comeback for the franchise as it was hyped up to be. At first, the open-world gameplay seems to be a promising new direction for the series, but as the game goes on, it starts to dawn on you that 95% of the content in the game is mind-numbingly repetitive. The cyberspace stages are just a watered-down iteration of the boost gameplay from previous modern Sonic games that repeat the same handful of level themes (which were already reused from Sonic Generations), and the platforming and puzzles in the open-world sections of the game never get much more challenging or deep than the first level. By the time you get to the third island, the game already feels like it's overstayed its welcome. The game does have its positive aspects, however. The music is incredible, as is to be expected from a Sonic game, and the graphics are some of the most impressive in the franchise. And at its core, the Sonic formula is still fun and it feels awesome to be able to control Sonic in an open environment. However, this game gets pretty boring the further you get into it and I don't really feel the desire to go back to this game like I do with say, Sonic Generations or Sonic Adventure 2 (the best game ever made). I can't say I'm too thrilled with the Sonic franchise becoming open-world given how it was executed here, but here's hoping the sequels improve on the formula somewhat.",,
"First Screen, right off the bat, trying to fix sound and screen settings, but typical click on what you want to change or effect... does NOT work, you got to first, from Option menu itself, click on Options first, THEN the next 'category' before it'll show you the actual options, (and right click to cancel to go back 'up' to previous choice)and even then, you can't click on the bar but make it go up/down 1 click at a time. So it DEFINITELY feels like strictly made for controller with mouse support as a side-afterthought. Even the on-screen controls show ""select"" with spacebar and ""ctrl"" for back. if you aren't going to have proper mouse support, don't put it in at all?

First level. Game freezes for 5-10 seconds, no keyboard controls work.
Trying to get in-game menu to try to get options, Half the time ESC didn't work or P wouldn't open menus, so had to quit the game to try to lower the settings even further, which was on default low, then lowered resolution few times.

Any game you have to do so much, just say your a controller-based game, and say keyboards not well supported. don't make me hit 208 buttons just to reset the level or escape, or even change volume. So bad startup impression I would refund it cause it'd take more then 2 hour to try to diagnose just exactly what's going wrong.|Went to borrow controller, and low-and-behold the game functions so much better, just proves it wasn't designed for keyboard/mouse for me. Should be posted on main page.

Edit : Plus after getting out of the first mission, had to reset the controller a few times (fully charged and default Xbox controller) cause the game chose to ignore the left stick's input after a load screen (fell off edge, oops). I haven't been able to get around first map without issues. then load screen tells me how to change outfits, cool, go to title screen... wait how do i get there again? ... after 5-10 minutes of exploring the menu, found no way to return to main menu.. so Alt-F4 it is.... Menus are NOT this difficult to make quite user-friendly

Editx2: Played for awhile more, using both keyboard/mouse (to test) and controller(to play/enjoy the game). This game is great if your console/controller based. But if PC, I would expect some basic fundamental UI ... well ""basics"" IE: you click on an option, it goes to it, not 3 other options so it will ""unlock"" your sound bar. can't just go to it and click. not major, but this applies to EVERYTHING in the game.

Yes, there are ""Free"" updates, and they are doing changes slowly, sure. It's the AAA price-tag and to put it kinda bluntly, a crap-show-poor PC-port job. As a console, sure put that Price up, but come to the PC world, there's basic standards for AAA games, such as FAR more control (without moding/file editing) on your graphic settings.

Some things I don't mind options being limited in like graphics, such as framerate, why are they making so few options? idk, but since the human eye for 90% of the population can't tell much above 60 fps, anything above that is basically useless for me.

TLDR: Great game, horrible price for POOR pc port by Sega. MUST have controller to really 'enjoy' and control the game. Get it under $30 and it'll be worthwhile buy, but there's no ""recommend on sale"" option.",,

Some people say that this is a major step forward for Sonic, I cannot say the same, this is a major step BACKwards instead.

"Notes: I only fully finished the first island, and got 25% through the second.

This game is so repetitive and boring it makes my mind boggle. It's so disappointing because at first, zipping around as Sonic in this open area is actually really fun (heck I played 10.4 hours of it). But when I realized that the entire game was just running around, collecting badges, talking to [SONIC CHARACTER HERE], and doing some Korok quest... I just stopped. When I play a video game, it's because it's fun and engaging. This game is fun, but frankly just not engaging. Where are the fresh ideas every island? Desert and Grass literally aren't different at all except some different terrain generation and new enemy types. Speaking of enemy types, there aren't a lot. There are around 5 for every island... and that's it. There are all copy and pasted everywhere.

A fun little programming oddity I encountered was when you move your mouse fast, the camera moves slow. Move your mouse slower, and the camera moves faster. Move your mouse as slow as possible, and the input won't even register.

Overall the core mechanics are very good. Combat is easily the only thing in this game that feels fully polished to the way it should be. Fighting enemies is fun, and the first island is a ton of fun. But like I've said before, the issue arises when that's really all to do.

Why is SONIC using the most bland and generic landscape types? As bad as Forces as, at least the Desert levels looked like a Sonic game.

The story is fine.

The main issue I have with this game is not the game itself: it's Sega. Sega, for some odd inexplicable reason, really hates Sonic. Actually, no. It hates SONIC FANS. I am amazed at how much of a beating Sonic fans can take and not leave.

It makes me sad that Sonic Team *really* wants this to be a good game, but Sega just will not let them do it. This game needed way more time in the oven to be fully fleshed out, but Sega just flat out refuses to! It's either that, or Sonic Team literally just sucks at everything they do... in that case it's still Sega's fault for keeping them around.

This game is a glorified tech demo, nothing more. At most it should be $30. It's bland, repetitive, and a low 6/10.

But hey, it's better than anything Sonic has done in the past 7 years so YAY!",,
I would say this game is just FUN. even the little quirks help it's charm.. on it's way to being the best sonic game... more please?,,

"Some of the worst performance I've ever seen in a AAA game, $60, and it comes with malware on it. All this to guarantee no one except the elite of the elite will be able to run this mediocre, asset-flip Sonic game. I regret playing the game as long as I did because that's a lot of money that I will never see again, all to buy this sh-tty, Denuvo-perverted hackjob mess of a Sonic game that I can't play above maybe a rocky 30 FPS on a good day.

Oh, and ""Verified"" for Steam Deck? Don't make me laugh. Someone should be fired for that rating. This game runs like hot, hot, HOT garbage on deck. As on PC, 30 FPS is a miracle to achieve, even at minimum settings. Even then, the device heats UP to the point I'm almost afraid it's going to catch fire. Not even state-of-the-art, graphically intensive games like DOOM Eternal push my hardware this hard, it's almost impressive how poorly this ultimately crappy game performs.

The game itself is fine. It's okay. It's not worth $60, and it's not worth nearly exploding my ""verified"" steam deck. The fact people defend this trashheap shows how low the bar is for Sega. Their fans will defend anything and everything they do, no matter how greedy and terrible.

But what if you're dying to play? Like, if you don't play the game RIGHT NOW, you're going to DIE? The answer is simple: emulation. The Switch version is far better performing via emulators, and best of all, piracy is free! So much for your crappy DRM, Sega. Don't buy this game; steal it. You get a better product at a lower price. Thank me later :)",,

"I'm surprised by my reaction to this game, and even a little conflicted. For context, I'm huge fan of Sonic and I'm coming from playing Forces recently. First off, this game is not great on Steam Deck. It must run at 30 fps to avoid screen flickering issues, and quality is poor at its screen resolution. If the Deck is your primary games console then I encourage you to hold off on Frontiers until something is improved.
That aside, my overall impression is quick because I could only bear less than an hour of gameplay. Sonic's control in the first two cyberspace stages is noticeably worse than Forces, and his physics are different than Generations and even Forces. It's odd how slow yet unwieldy Sonic is in Cyberspace. This game is funner than it looks, because cyberspace looked pretty sick from the videos I'd seen of it. However, managing to play the first two levels called back to my time playing Shadow and Sonic 06 and trying to control Sonic/Shadow in those games.
The open zone seemed mildly entertaining. I'll give this game a second chance when it's a better price and I have a better machine to play it on. I'm hoping the open zone gameplay gives a better impression after a year or two.

EDIT: It's an okay game. It doesn't meet my expectations for a Sonic game, but there are much worse games out there.",,
"It was a fun game, but it's not worth $60. I would say $30 because the worlds are basically copy and paste with a different skin. I'm still lacking the motivation to finish the last island because I'm tired of doing the same thing. Run around the map to collect gears, use gears to unlock mini-game levels to get keys, use keys to unlock emeralds, gather all the emeralds to fight final boss, rinse and repeat 4 times. The game is just kind of a grind and saps the fun out of everything with the repetitiveness. The graphics are amazing, the gameplay is great, the enemies are cool, but it just fails in variety. Also the final bosses were kinda meh since you just smash attack buttons over and over or parry when instructed; some of the mini bosses are harder than all of the final bosses.",,
the game is midtier,,
"i would just like to say for being open world its somewhat terrible especially with all the random crap littered every where the trailers show a much nicer open world feel but it feels like they took the forests and structures away and gave you rails platforms and bounce pads at random, besides that the controls feel awkward on key board and i have tried controller that didn't work for me either, then there's the fact that speed runners had already beat the game even before it was released, must i go on... just terrible all in all for me Sigh",,

I really like Sonic Frontiers and now I will list the things I like and don't like about the game:

Likes:
- The gameplay is fresh and unique
- Atmosphere - The world feels empty and depressing and it's really unique for a Sonic game. It's just so interesting that in this game, there's a lot of emphasis on not only ""going fast"", but also stopping to drink in all the scenery.
- Graphics - The game looks very beautiful with not only its texture quality, but with its overall aesthetic
- The game is well optimized for my PC and my specs are not too heavy, but still hold up strong (aka i7-3960X, 32 GB DDR3 Ram, GTX 1050Ti)

Dislikes:
- Sonic's voice actor - His voice is too deep to be sonic and it's cringy. lol. My exact first words were: ""the voice actor makes it seem like Sonic's balls have dropped."" LOL
- Some visual glitches, but it's not too big of a deal really. I can live with it, but some other people might consider it immersion breaking...
- The handling of Sonic - It's kind of loose and weird feeling. Like you don't feel like you have tight control over Sonic's movements and sometimes you may miss a jump or angle sonic in such a way that you didn't quite want him to move in. (It's kind of hard to describe, but it's kind of like, you know when you use a gun there's the phrase: ""point and shoot"", well it feels like when you control Sonic you can't always accurately point sonic in the direction you want him to go. Sometimes he will just fling off the stage with a slight mismovement of the thumbstick.

- The only real major criticism I have with this game is that after the third island, it starts to feel a bit repetitive, but luckily the game ends in time before it starts to feel like it was dragged on for too long...

I had similar sentiments with Red Dead Redemption 1 (which is not currently on steam), but was an excellent game similarly to this one, because it initially felt unique and was fun to play and then started to get repetitive, but wasn't dragged on for an unnecessarily long time.

Nonetheless and despite my minor and nitpicky criticisms, I really loved this game so far and I would highly recommend it as a birthday gift or just a gift in general for someone who wants to try something fresh and new from the Sonic series of games.",,
"I don't know.

The basics are alright, but it doesn't really layer much else on top of that. The first island is the best part, but then it just repeats itself across the rest and stretches the basic premise really thin between the incredibly short (but fun) stages vs the pretty empty open world areas, Eventually it feels like they just give up and do a bunch of on-rails segments with fixed camera angles, and the boss fights are mostly some form of quick-time events. The fishing segments are bizarre, they clearly didn't want to make them horribly annoying so instead made them incredibly watered down and not very fun. There's a disproportionate amount of tedious little puzzles versus actual stages.

The story is pretty bland and it spends a lot of time with characters just standing around and making references to older games, then some stuff happens that I struggle to care about.

It's not really a game where thumbs up or thumbs down would be accurate, it's kind of a 6/10 game that plays okay but is very empty. It's a lot less messy and broken than many other post-Dreamcast Sonic games but also doesn't really try to do anything to push itself.",,

In my head, I see the sonic game I've always wanted. Basically the same level design as the first three games, but the ability to turn around. Branching paths, underwater sections.
This game IS sonic 2006… they've just expanded the hub world, same jenky physics and same let's play it for you rail segments.
There have been lots of fans made sonic games that capture that feeling I've been looking for, sonic team is probably dead. Sega went to Sammy and all the talent left.

"First and foremost, this is the most fun I have had from a Sonic game since Sonic Generations. Which says a lot as I personally am not a fan of the Boost Formula implemented in the series since Sonic Unleashed. The most fun I have experienced with that style being from Generations itself. However, I can say that the Boost stages in this are very nerfed compared previous entries. Thus I still find myself coming back to those stages more than those titles. The slower movement allows for more accurate precision, yet at the same time is diminished by the clunky heavy physics that makes Sonic feel like a race car present since Unleashed. Even with these issues present, being cut down to each stage averaging around 1-2 mins feels like a godsend for my attention span. As well as the music doing a fantastic job at immersing me into the idea of cyberspace. I have thoroughly enjoyed these stages and hope more improvements can be done in the future through updates, as well as future titles.

The open zones, however, were a different story entirely! Allowing the player to control Sonic in a sandbox playground more akin to that of the Adventure Field from Sonic Adventure while still maintaining the core premise of Sonic gameplay was a very delightful change and I welcome it immensely. Although some challenges and puzzles started to become more mundane than others, it did a good job keeping me engaged. The exploratory element coupled with the interesting gimmicks was a wonderful change of pace from prior titles. The combat for example was a fun addition. The unique ways to approach each enemy while stringing combos together was a breath of fresh air to this series. Sometimes it was a bit wonky, but can be over looked because... c'mon... it's Sega.

The story was where the game fell a little short. Don't get me wrong. Ian Flynn is a great writer I respect the hell out of the man. Especially growing up reading Archie's Sonic the Hedgehog comic series as well as continuing to support through IDW's run. But the plot had this nice sense of mystery and wonder to it that when it was all said and done the ending was a little lack luster. Still... the story does a substantial job falling in line with the story telling quality of the Adventure days of the franchise, and is considerably better than anything we have received from this series in years. I love the little interactions between Sonic and the other characters, allowing us to dive more into the relations between them. I even thought all the callbacks and easter eggs to prior titles and other media were charming in their own rights.

All in all I enjoyed Sonic Frontiers and consider it a notable step in the right direction for the series, and I hope to see continued success from this series in the future. Let's do it to it Sega!

*I also want to point out that this is (at the time of this review) the only steam game I put forth the effort to sit down and 100% complete and earn all the steam achievements. If that doesn't say enough I don't know what will.*",,

"I absolutely would recommend this to anyone sonic fan or not, the open zone gameplay was extremely fun and enjoyable so were the side stories and character interactions. However I have two negatives about this game firstly the cyberspace just doesn't feel right, compared to generations or unleashed HELL even forces the controls and physics feel weird and my final problem is the true final boss is just kinda underwhelming it's hard but didn't really feel cool or sonic to me, felt more like Touhou but regardless I definitely would recommend this game.",,

"So far, fun game getting used to the movement was easy yet it feels like I'm just scratching the surface which is great. Hopefully the other zones so far are not ""get the chaos emeralds to fight big boss"". The only thing I wish was different is that this game and sonic games in general would stop trying to be so serious it feels like every sonic game there is a melodramatic story where everything is taken seriously, it's funny to see anthropomorphic animals say crap like ""that's why it's called war victor"". Not saying sonic games can't have story just make it like a story from one of the Mario RPG stories, A story that can be serious but not to the point the game forget's it's main character is a anthropomorphic blue hedgehog.",,

This game repeats the same stuff over and over again and it is already a bore when i'm on the second island only and i was losing motivation quick to play this game for long and it was confusing to me on what i was supposed to do as it did not give a clear indicator in my opinion

The combat actually is decently fun if a little mashy, the enemies mostly feel unique and actually feel like a natural evolution of sonics fast movement system instead of an annoyance. The music is lack luster most of the time and the cyber space levels all mostly suck, usually just being worse versions of sonic levels from previous games, but the open world is practically a gigantic fun ass level so it evens out

The game cuts way too many corners and has a severe dip in quality about 40% into the game. I would not recommend this game at full price.

Warning: Minor Spoilers ahead

CONS:
- Cyber stages are poor attempts to reuse level design from past games, most from SA2.
- Only 4 aesthetic themes for all the cyber stages despite the above point
- 3rd island is janky to play since most of the platforming challenges forces you into the 2D perspective
- 4th island is nothing like the others and consists of ONLY a few tower challenges that can all be finished in ~30min. Also uses the other half of the 1st island as a base instead of being a new island.
- Final Titan not nearly as fun to play as the others. Spectacle is nowhere near as good either.
- The last boss
- Pop-in is really REALLY bad, with obstacles and assets loading in even AFTER you get to them. Playing on a 3070 with a 5600X. The game is poorly optimized.
- open zone obstacle assets are all generic and don't relate to the island's theme
- 60 FPS lock, while there's ways to remove the FPS cap, it ends up breaking the game at several points.
- parry isn't a parry, but is instead a block you can hold that auto-counters (which trivializes fights)

PROS:
- First 3 titan fights, albeit play janky, are super cool spectacles with amazing music. Probably the most memorable super sonic segments there've been.
- The fundamental concept of running around as sonic in an open area is just plain fun, especially in the first two islands.",,

"It's an amazing step forward in the franchise and you should definitely try it, but there are just some design decisions that don't make sense to me. Here are the biggest that stick out to me:

In an open world setting why did they decide to copy and paste the same assets everywhere. All the islands have the same buildings and platform style. Even some coloration differences could have helped. It makes the world feel artificial and boring. There are also times where I would find a neat place for a boss or item that was just empty. If you go open world maybe you should fill it with things to discover constantly, as that's like the whole appeal to it.

Sonic controls so different in Cyberspace levels and 2D sections. Moving around in the world doesn't feel too bad itself, but for some reason the physics and parameters of his movement change when you're at certain parts. Not to mention when you jump it doesn't carry your momentum. It's a probably that keeps happening with these games, When you're moving fast and jump you expect to jump at the same speed as when you're moving, but instead you're usually met with slow down. It feels awful and I don't understand it.

The BIGGEST headache I had with this game was increasing my Ring and Speed Level. With the seeds of Power and Defense you just hand them in and bam, you go from like LV 6 to LV 23 in an instant. But for some reason the only way you can level up your Ring/Speed is one at a time, handing in 12 Koco for your choice of level up. When you have an achievement that requires you to max these stats out, why is it designed like that? The system is there... and yet they put you through the pain of slowly leveling those skills ONE at a time... I don't understand it.

Even still, it's the most fun and comfortable Sonic game I've played in a while. It changes the formula nicely, and with a few tweaks and proper consistency I can see a masterpiece for modern Sonic games on the horizon.",,

Very enjoyable game but too short for 60 euro. Also didn't enjoy the last boss compared too the first boss.,,

needs more cyberspace themes and can feel repetitive but the game is fun and the ost slaps,,
The first boss has the best soundtrack EVER,,
Game Gud,,
"I had fun with this game. It's not the best game ever, it's also very far off from being the worst game ever. It is the best of the current sonic games, which is a low bar... There are issues with some of the aspects of the gameplay, mostly the combat being sometimes a chore. Some of the mini-bosses I just flat-out avoid.",,
"9/10. pretty much everything was phenomenal (music, story, gameplay) but they did fumble the final boss a bit (first part was easier than the rest of the bosses, second part was... well I'll just say a letdown).

soundtrack's probably the best one of the year, only song I didn't exactly care for was I'm Here (the main theme, funnily enough) but the boss themes are SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GOOD ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ THEY WENT SO NUTS ON THESE WHY WAS THIS SNUBBED AT THE GAME AWARDS

graphics are another thing I should mention, as shown in pre-release stuff there is a decent bit of pop-in but there was only one time I really minded it tbh. there were also a couple instances where the shadows freaked out, but again I didn't really mind.

controls are great, not 100% perfect but eh I doubt I've ever played a 3D game with perfect controls. Sonic feels great to control, though funnily enough maybe a bit slow. you can upgrade his speed at certain places, but it did feel a bit clunky to do.

combat's a crucial part of this game, and thankfully it works really well. there were a couple instances where I got ganged up on by some lesser enemies and they could attack me while I was attacking other enemies, which got a bit annoying, but it wasn't unbearable.

thankfully the combat was fun to execute, though some moves felt a bit odd to perform. probably just my inexperience with the character action genre tho. skill tree was cool but honestly I didn't really get why these were necessary inclusions. eh, probably just me.

just remembered, the performance. loading times could be a bit long, which did get annoying at some points (reloading my save, going in and out of cyber space, etc.) but at least with the cyber space there was the training stuff to do while you waited. nice time waster.

story's phenomenal, as should be expected from Ian Flynn (the main guy in charge of the Sonic comics since like 2006). Sage is an amazing character and I hope she comes back in a future game. really cool to see some more Sonic lore honestly, hope to see more of that

oh yeah THE BOSS FIGHTS dude the music combined with the gameplay and the spectacle of it all just became such an amazing experience every time, especially with the second boss. I'm not spoiling a thing here, these need to be experienced. (well, the main three at least).

so yeah all in all Sonic Frontiers isn't a perfect game by any means but it's just such an amazing experience that it's entirely worth playing for that alone. probably my favorite game of the year, though tbf I've only played Kirby and the Forgotten Land and Splatoon 3. buy this game. if you're hesitant, get it on sale. but you need to play this game.",,
buy now yes,,
first good sonic game,,
"Amazing game.

Play it and just make your own opinion.",,
"this game is honestly extremely lack luster. the story is really bad, the movement is terrible, and the RANDOM POP INS just makes this game a complete NO.

my biggest issue is the way they decided to do cut scenes. its literally sonic 06. for example when you have to talk to amy it pretty much goes like this-find her, loads cut scene of you throwing hearts at her. then load actual cut scene where its literally a bunch of random nonsense that can be summed up with a few words. literally. most of the cut scenes is just sonic asking how someone is feeling then getting some extremely drawn out response for no reason other than to fill in gaps of time, then another small load to get back to the open world. and this happens MULTIPLE TIMES BACK TO BACK.

the story is also really really bad. the ""villain"" is also really bad. controls feel off most of the time, and sonic will stick to random objects for no reason at all leading to him just standing on walls/rocks. the ""cyber space"" levels arent fun at all. they control terribly and the recovery time on the homing attack is terrible. honestly theres no point in using it. i found myself avoiding enemies rather than fighting them in cyber space levels because of how much time it wastes just having sonic float in mid air for so long.

the enemies are BORING. i started on hard and WOW does it not do anything. im not expecting the next darksouls from it but most has extremely long wind ups that make it impossible to actually get hit unless you have the reaction time of a 3 year old. the ""titans"" are also all bland and boring. like 1 literally doesnt even attack AT ALL. another has a huge wind up so you dont really get hit, the tower is boring bland and just lame. it literally poses zero challenge and zero effort. then theres the squid which is the most fun to fight but thats because you're chasing it at high speeds, but once you catch it it kinda doesnt do anything except let you beat its ass for the most part then runs away again. BORING.

then theres the open world part. the world is empty once you kill the asura and squid. theyre huge and super noticeable but once theyre gone you're left with a empty ugly and boring to look at world. the puzzles are also extremely boring and you can tell they put zero effort into them. there hasnt been a single one i saw and thought hmm.

overall just another really bad sonic game. this is literally sonic 06 with a reskin for the most part and half the content cut out. everything just feels off and you'd think theyd actually fix the issue with sonic sticking to surfaces but nope. exactly like in 06.",,
"Good game, but it's unplayable without the improved physics mod. It's more similar to Mario Odyssey than Breath of the Wild in my opinion",,
I liked this sonc,,
"I wanted to finish the game before giving my thoughts, and careful consideration as to what I was going to write. I'm a long time Sonic fan (ever since the first game, really) and I came with doubts about the game. There are positives, but my doubts are confirmed, and I'll explain why I decide I cannot recommend that game.

On the plus side: I had some fun. Exploring the open zones with Sonic is a dream come true, and for once it handles semi-correctly (more on that on the minus side). The fighting is fun, if a little simplistic, though the moves variety is often useless except for the cool factor (which I'm on board with, honestly). The writing is phenomenal: the story isn't very profound or interesting in itself, but the character writing is the best thing we've had in the series so far. I want Ian Flynn unleashed for the Sonic series, I trusted him, he mostly delivered. Also notably, I didn't encounter anything I would consider a bug, which I was pleasantly surprised with.

Why the gloom, then, you'd ask? Well, the main point of contention is the state of the game. It is particularly obvious in the Cyberspace levels, that are barely playable. The handling is made for the open zone, and it shows, you are barely able to control Sonic, and you mostly are on a roller coaster where any diversion from the path will be punished HARSHLY. It's not 06 levels of frustration, but only because you're mostly on a rail. And, sadly, it shows in the open zones too. Even without paying too much attention to it, it is very noticeable the game is only fun to handle because many sections, many things, put you on an assisted rail, even when it is detrimental. I enjoy the 2D phases and all, and the seamless integration of 2D parts in open zone is kinda nice at moments, but the game is really only barely holding itself together because of such tinkering. It goes along with the abysmal technical quality of the game, that is UGLY, the textures are UGLY, the animation aren't very interesting, the pop-in is atrocious especially if you try to 100% an island (which is useless, luckily) and cannot see the way leading to a memory token. There is nothing interesting to do beside going through the story, fighting and hearing the snippets of side story (that are way less interesting than the main one). The ""open zone design"" is a failure in that regard: it's just a sandbox for you to speed around, but a little motivation would go a long way, this is clearly no Breath of the Wild that I can go back to whenever and have fun. I don't really want to go back to it now it's over. The repetitivity between the different island is a real burden. It is simply a collectathon which is lazy in 2020.

Those negatives are the reason I can't recommend the game, despite liking it well enough: Sega shouldn't be rewarded for it. This is one of the biggest licence of a significant company, and it should be better. This is not what a licence game, that took 7 years to make and had high ambition should be like. Fans deserve better. It is overall a lazy performance, and it is incomprehensible when almost every Mario or Zelda manages to reach a much better level of quality. I don't like Mario or Zelda (except BOTW). I like Sonic. Sega, don't make me have to praise them when I review a Sonic game!

Side notes: Fishing is boring, but a good way to avoid some need for collection or upgrade your character. The true last boss is a complete failure in design, whether it be graphic or game design. And I want a Knuckles and a Shadow game with characters as well written and respected as the characters in this game.",,
10/10 Flying off the map simulator.,,
a pleasant surprise,,
"This game is amazing! Even if the experience only took me about a day complete, every second was a blast. The islands, the music, and Sonic himself felt so good to be with. . Plus, you get to have some many interactions with a few of the sonic cast. It made me feel like they had some actual character development. Get this game! A lot of people are saying Sonic is heading back in the right direction,and I believe them.",,

good game up til the 2nd island,,
0-0,,
Its pretty fun,,
Sonic frontiers lacks cohesion and feels like a tech demo. The open world lacks any degree of character. This was a big chance to finally reexamine this series and innovate but we are getting more of the same. A wasted opportunity.,,
"Okay to let you know I'm a Sonic fan so I have a bias.

Let me be clear; this is an adventure beat em up platforming Open World RPG, it is a bizarre genre mash up BUT I LOVE IT! If you don't like this kind of genre mash up, I don't know what to tell you.

Combat, speed, and other forms of play styles compliment each other, and the cyber worlds are a mix of, ""eh"", and good. They're required levels but not as bad as before.

I wish this had some more RPG elements to really allow you to build upon those elements. Sonic is fast, however if you want Sonic to be faster, the game allows you to go out of your way to improve your speed, and a gradual getting used to faster, and faster speeds.

That's not to say all the ideas merge together beautifully, defensive play you have to be patient and wait for an opening. Other than that; beautiful merging of game play elements.",,

Possibly one of the Best Sonic Games I have ever played. This might be a must try at least.,,
cool game,,
"As someone who's been a Sonic fan since i was a kid i can't help to see the pain that was his poorly made games, since the early 2010s Sonic has always been a punching bag for critics a big name youtubers nowadays but this time I genuinely believe that this is one of the better Sonic games out there, it tried something new and I feel it paid off.

Sonic himself feels great to control he's a good balance between speed and control which can also be upgraded for further speed, i was concerned that the collectable items were all gonna be required for 100% completion which thankfully aren't as they're easy to get and you can just straight up buy them at Big's fishing area (music in there is so good)
The new open zone areas are a great fit for Sonic as it doesn't confine him to the standard level layout they honestly feel similar to the areas you'd see in a 3D Mario game but have enough space for Sonic to move around quickly.

The story i felt was really good for Sonic standards, its nice to see all the characters given more personality this really goes double for Sage who I really like how her arc went in this game.

Combat is also a step up taking some inspiration from character action games like DMC or Bayonetta I ended up enjoying it a lot, really helps make the enemies more of a threat it isn't as in depth as those games but what was done i felt was pretty good!

Most of the bosses and titans were fun as well making use of the mechanics of the game in effective and fun ways which makes most of them fun to fight.

There is of course issues i have with this game like how when touching certain boost pads, springs, etc. you sometimes get locked into a 2D view which i get why but its also annoying as it forces me to take away from the intended path i wanted to go to, then there are the cutscenes for the mini-bosses or when Sonic's ring count is maxed out while they were cool the first couple of times they quickly got annoying and in the case of the mini-bosses it would lock the camera to said boss when i tried to run away it also restricted map usage which was also frustrating honestly i felt they should've taken a queue from BOTW and just but the bosses health bar on top of the screen and in the maxed ring count cutscene make it a simple cut-in.

Also for some reason when you die to a titan boss you loose all your rings which i'm baffled by not sure if that's an oversight but it made getting the chaos emerald from the third boss more annoying

Also the final boss... yeah wont spoil it but man what a let down really should've been more hype.

Also sometimes parrying feels off to me there isn't really a good or clear visual indicator for his parry, sure he does an animation but it's kinda hard to see when fighting against enemies.
Overall though if you like Sonic you'll probably like this, if you don't like the boost formula or previous Sonic games then i ask you could try and give this game ago because i think this new gameplay style might be more suited towards this new group of people.

Must say this is a great start for a new Sonic formula and I eagerly await for SEGA to expand upon this gameplay style in a future Sonic game.",,
"There's some bits that could absolutely use polish and some of the later things feel a bit rushed (as well as some of the required challenges feeling a little unfair), but having completed the game I really enjoyed it! The writing was good, the story was excellent, and the characters felt on point- most of all, that carried me through the bits that I really disliked.

Even if it's far from perfect, it feels like there's a lot of heart and a lot of love put into this, and I hope to see them carry it forward to the next adventure!

My only really petty complaint is that it feels way too hard to trigger area/idle lines, so I hope that gets fixed eventually? They feel too rare at the moment.",,
They did it lads,,
Finally a really good sonic game,,
finally something playable,,
"Am I biased? Absolutely.
Do I care? No.",,
Literally the BEST Sonic game of ALL TIME!!,,
gaem,,
good game,,
"Being a Sonic fan I couldn't recommend this enough it has great open world game play the new attacks are so cool and the story along with it has been very incredible too, if you yourself are a fan you gotta try this game out for sure.",,
"Despite its jank, and how it looks like it wouldn't be fun, playing it yourself is somehow fun. I don't understand why.
That being said, the third island has too much 2D. And the lack of polish really should be addressed by managing Sonic Team better with a bigger staff and budget next time.
I'd recommend playing this game without seeing anything past the story trailer, the US marketing for this game was really bad (e.g. IGN footage provided by SEGA and always not showing enough of how the game is fun). They also gave too many surprises after that story trailer.

Again, I really had fun with this game, but it's also one of the more janky Sonic games I've played. I really like the story too; a story that takes itself seriously for once? That's just what I wanted. It doesn't feel real, after having had 13 years of stories that ""don't take itself too seriously"", I hate that being spread as a positive point for stories that don't try hard enough. We need more serious stories and this game has one, though some of the callbacks are a bit baffling...
This Sonic game is crazier than any other Sonic game I've played.
""Experience Sonic like never before!"" That sure is accurate.

Also, please stop using old level aesthetics for easy nostalgia points. It's been 12 years of using Green Hill, please try to make a fully original game with no throwback zones for once.",,
"The best way I can describe this game is unpolished.
Just taking one look at the world gives you that impression immediately as you can find a lot of the same boost pads, rails, springs, and climbable walls placed everywhere. They don't even really fit into the environment, not only making them look like they were placed somewhat haphazardly, but they tend to clash with the general aesthetic of the world a lot of the time.
The pop in can get pretty obnoxious at times as you'll be running through the world at top speed having a pretty good time, before you are suddenly stopped in your tracks for seemingly no reason and then a rock pops into existence about a second or two later. This also makes it significantly harder to traverse the world as important obstacles that can help you get from point to point or landmarks that help you get an idea where you are might not show up until you've blasted past them.
One of the most baffling and aggravating decisions is the Elder Koco. There's two Kocos who can level up two of Sonic's stats. The Koco Hermit upgrades his Attack and Defense stats at the same time, and levels them up as high as you're materials allow you to, through one or two confirmation menus. But the other one that upgrades your Ring Count and Speed requires you to choose a stat, confirm the stat, watch a small animation, get past a ""sonic is 1 point better"" menu, before choosing your next stat to level up. In order to just get the max speed level, you have to do that 99 times... and 198 times if you also want a max ring count. WHY. If this game gets an update please, for the love of every thing, let me dump multiple points into a speed/ring stat at the same time.

The Boost system is a bit over-emphasized as it's always the fastest way to get around. They bring back the Drop Dash, but there is never really a reason to use it as you can just hit a button and immediately be at top speed anyways. Which breaks my heart because I loved the drop dash in Sonic Mania! Heck, momentum in general tends to be really wonky. Sometimes you can roll down a sloped hill and gain speed, other times you'll roll about five feet and stop dead in your tracks on an even steeper incline.

However despite all that... it's still fun.
Combat is simple and fairly easy, even with all the additional moves Sonic gains. It tends to offset that by making some of the enemies only beatable in one way, and you often have to approach most of them differently. Admittedly some of them can be a tad aggravating, but most are a nice break from the platforming.
Sonic controls well (the only thing I ever had problems with was the homing attack) and his speed at times can just be borderline hilarious at times. Sometimes an enemy will cause the camera to shift over and focus on them and before they're even half-way though their first attack animation, you can blast off to the other side of the map and they'll just pop out of existence. Sometimes I'd forget just how fast I was and end up going top speed into a bottomless pit, and I just found it hilarious. He's responsive and I always enjoyed trying to find new dumb ways to traverse the world.
It has fun with it's story, and isn't worried taking itself too seriously and constantly being ""meta"". Sure plenty of people will say it's cheesy or that it takes itself to seriously, but I appreciate that they're willing to try something closer the the Sonic Adventure style and roll with it. (Especially with how stale the Sonic Colors style of writing got.)

This game is odd. I see all the ideas Sonic Team had but they either didn't have the budget, time, or man power to achieve all of them. If Frontiers serves as a sort of base and they expand on what they have here I think they could do something amazing. This game is a mess... but a fun mess. I always appreciate Sonic games always trying something different, but I hope they really stick with this ""Open Zone"" idea for a little bit. Work out the bugs and give it some polish!

Personally I'd wait for a price drop though. Unless you're a die hard sonic fan or like me (stupid), 60$ is pretty steep.",,
"Overall this game is just ok. But the really good parts such as the cyberspace levels, story, bosses, and soundtrack ultimately outweigh the really bad parts like the open world and the cutscenes. I'm glad Sonic Team is finally making a comeback after spewing nothing but garbage since after 2011. (not counting Mania, that wasn't Sonic Team)",,

If you are still on the fence, maybe wait for a sale, but buy it whenever that sale goes down, BUY IT. You will not regret playing it.",,
"I was skeptical at first mainly because it was a Sega game and yes, it is a Sega game at it's core but this is easily the best Sega game since Sonic Generations or maybe Sonic Mania depending on point of view. It has it's flaws and bugs but would it really be a sonic game if it didn't. The voice actors finally sound like they gave a ♥♥♥♥ and the story while a little hard to follow and a little basic in some areas was better than basically anything Sega has pumped out in ages. It's like a mix of Mario Odyssey and Phantasy Star Online 2 New Genesis with a sense of speed that most companies would be scared to include in a game. Most of the annoyances can definitely be fixed in an update and if they aren't than it's not to big of a deal aside from that damn elder koco that forces you to go through his dialogue 196 separate times. All and all a great game that I will definitely be replaying multiple times through.",,
"A good Sonic story, with references to previous games, with good gameplay and really cool interactions.

Cyberspace isn't the greatest part of the game but it's still pretty fun and speedrunning it is actually a blast once you learn about movement techs.

The open zones are all really cool and the level design is very cool aswell.

The game controls awful you feel like you have no actual control over sonic everything is delayed its aggravating as all hell.

"Hands down the best 3D sonic game bar none. At least a 9/10 for me.

Pros:
-Fun, fast gameplay
-Exceedingly tight controls (you can edit Sonic's physics using sliders to tailor it to your liking)
-Boost is fun to use but isn't overpowered
-Combat is fun and fast pace, minibosses don't overstay their welcome
-Music slaps so damn hard
-Boss fights are a treat
-Open zones are a joy to explore, and they seem perfectly designed around Sonic's speed and moveset
-Cyberspace levels (traditional sonic style acts) are short but sweet


Cons:
-Pop-in is pretty apparent, though it's only props and not terrain
-Some frame drops (could just be my 1050ti laptop)
-Cyberspace levels use default physics sliders
-There is a healthy amount of Sonic Team Jank™, as every Sonic Team game is bound to have

WARNING: LONG TEXT WALL INCOMING
Multiple changes to the game's controls and design are notable, but a few really stand out to me. One such thing is an important change to the Boost; No longer does Sonic Boost in the direction he is facing, but rather he Boosts in the direction you hold on the control stick. This also works for Air Boosts, giving you tight control over Sonic in the air. This helps in every facet of gameplay, from 2D platforming, to 3D platforming, and even combat.
Another thing that really makes the game for me is the design of the Cyberspace acts. A few do stand out as kind of boring (3-5 is a notable one) but the rest are very well designed. One noticeable thing about the acts is that a large majority have reused level designs from past Sonic games. Stages from Adventure 2, Unleashed, and Generations all make their return in the Cyberspace format, with the Unleashed and Generations stages being split between the 3D sections and 2D sections. However, these aren't just direct ports; a Sonic fan with a keen eye will notice that most of these stages have had two major changes to them: for one, they are adapted in scale to match Sonic's new abilities (this applies mostly to the Adventure 2 levels, but the other levels also had some scaling changes to match this). Another change is the minimisation of automation. In the process of converting these levels (and also creating the original stages) it seems Sonic Team had a large focus on minimising the automation in them, allowing the player to be in full control of Sonic for longer. In reality, aside from a few exceptions, these stages aren't much longer than Forces' stages. However in these stages you're in control of Sonic for far longer and the levels themselves feel longer. Sure I would've preferred long 4-5 minute Unleashed stages but since Cyberspace isn't even the main focus of the game I'm not too concerned about their length.
The real main focus, the open zone is designed very well; the zone is home to tons of mini platforming sections (and a few quite long ones that would make entire stages on their own) and they string together quite neatly. Whenever you complete a challenge (of which consist of various mini games, ranging from defeating a dummy or reaching a point in the map within a certain time), part of the map is revealed to you, and long rails in the sky are generated between these completed challenges for easy traversal. These rails are the reason why there isn't any fast travel until you complete the map, since anywhere you want to go you'll be able to reach using Sonic's abilities and he can get wherever you're going quite fast.
The boss fights of each island are insanely fun. I don't want to bother explaining how they work but just imagine Super Sonic fighting an angel from Evangelion while sick ass metalcore plays in the background.

TL;DR This game is very good, not a masterpiece by any means but it's an absolute blast and full of SOUL™.",,
"this feels like a prototype for a full game
regardless though its still really fun and they translated sonic into open world really well
If youre a sonic fan, a pretend sonic fan or not a sonic fan, youll enjoy your playthrough for this. Just hope they dont throw this concept away and make Forces 2 and instead try to build on this game",,
"BEST Sonic game as of late, I truly loved the 23hrs I put into it",,
FINALLY A GODLIKE SONIC GAME LETS GOOOOOO,,
:D,,
"I just hit 100% on my main save file and I already want to do it again not only for the story and the gameplay, but also just how good this game feels. The story is well paced, Sonic doesnt have cringe lines but instead him and his friends have actual deep conversations about the world around them and not throwing quips every other line, Sonic's new deeper voice also helps with this as it feels like not only has his voice aged, but his personality. He still does his quips and witty remarks so its not like hes a whole new person but it is still refreshing to see him be more mature. Combat while simple, still managed to have me fairly engaged from when to parry and what skill to use after for max damage to finding the best way to be flashy with how I finish off some enemies. Not to mention the bosses. Dear god they are the best bosses in any Sonic game ever. From the design of the bosses to the phenomenal songs that play with each boss. Cyberspace is a bit on the weird side though, with the occasionally awkward control of Sonic and sometimes really short levels. Though they make up for it with the really good level design of them, some of those stages left my jaw dropped at how stunning they are. Getting S-Ranks on them isnt to hard, except 1-2 which requires damn near perfection and I love it and kinda wish all S-Rank requirements were like it. This game is a breath of fresh air for Sonic and I highly recommend getting 100% and going through the side quests as they pop up due to them containing interesting conversations about the story for when they pop up and doing them too late does feel off cause you already might know some of the stuff you get told if you wait to do them. Overall 9/10 game.",,

"This is kinda hard but I give the game a 7/10. sonic feels amazing to play as in the open world I love the mobility you have and all the possible ways you can do the very repetitive fetch quests the amount of times we have to collect memory fragments makes it so boring to play, and you have to LOOK for them they don't tell you that if you kill enemies it gives you some or if you do the spiny thing on some polls it gives you some(if they did I don't remember). it's really sad that such a big world has little to no enemies a mini boss here and there when the combos/combat are actually pretty fun! after leveling up the skill twig (not calling it tree be real its tiny af) you get so many combos you really don't use a lot and you end up running past some enemies some times it's just not fun to fight the same 4 enemies sue me. cyberspace is so raw and unfinished its mooing, the fact that you go slower than what you go in the open world is so weird and 2D levels feel like sonic has a broken spine and legs why do you go so slow? its really annoying I disliked the 2D sections in other modern sonic games in the past but I would give everything to have them back on this game, it's like they forgot the formula they had for those type of levels why not in cyberspace have the generations formula? bring back the drift! so you can actually build up speed! and go fast? lol like sonic? but instead they have ONE cyberspace level where you ""drift"" and its the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ever lmao, every time you ""finish"" a level (just getting the emeralds) you go and fight a titan boss and...ITS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AWESOME!! ROCK MUSIC, SUPER SONIC BEING EXTREMELY STRONG TOSSING THEM TO MOUNTAINS AND ♥♥♥♥ bro its so good and after sonic gets shot from the sky?........even though he can totally dodge lol but ok I guess, after that you do EVERYTHING again except it's a different world. writing is ok I absolutely LOVE the interactions sonic's friends have with him even calling back to past games! it was really cool to see tails ""Growing up"" saying he wants to go solo for a while and seeing how sonic gets a little sad yet proud all characters have cool dialog and I like that i feel like it's a missed opportunity to not have more characters to interact with... and then there's egg man..why is egg man here? this would've been the same game if he wasn't here lol this is literally just to show that egg man ♥♥♥♥♥ SPOILERS!!!!!! Sage is egg mans ""daughter"" but really just a robot he created. music pops its amazing the music they give the titans its amazing, there is only one cyberspace level that has a decent song and its 1-2, MEGA SPOILERS: remember when I said the titan bosses were amazing and had bad ass sonic moments and bad ass music? well I think devs ran out of time or money because the final boss is the only reason I'm making this. all ill say is ""what happened?..."" the final boss of sonic frontiers is SO BAD..IT'S THE WORST FINAL BOSS IN A SONIC GAME ill say it again THE ""W O R S T"" BOSS IN A SONIC GAME!! it's a bullet hell...that lasts WAYYY too long with terrible music and she keeps talking NON STOP it's not sonic's friends going ""you can do it sonic! you got this sonic!"" 200 times a second its this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss talking about what we did and what they did...and also ITS A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ASTEROID ITS SO LAUGHABLE sonic and the secret rings had a better boss man what the hell happened?? every boss before this was making me give this game a 100000/10 and this final boss RUINED the game for me, there has to be a secret boss I don't know about because this was BAD lmao. at the end of the day I enjoyed it I had fun ruining around the world can get a bit boring after awhile and cyberspace levels are not good i'm sorry Im just sad this isn't the game I was hoping for the only redeeming quality the game has is super sonic being able to fight giant bosses as him was my favorite part of the game and that basically it thx for reading babe",,
"Every living creature, save for the hedgehog species itself, knows the tumultuous history of Sonic The Hedgehog as a franchise. Comic books, TV shows, spin-offs, 2D-to-3D transition, etc. So it made sense why everyone would be apprehensive after the poor reception of Sonic Forces, not to mention the disastrous launch and marketing of both Colors Ultimate (still not on Steam as of this review) and Origins. But 5 years and 1 day after Forces released, Sonic Team has managed to break the cycle, and do so without re-writing the entire foundation of Sonic.

Frontiers can be described as an open-world platformer RPG, in general terms. If we need games as the reference, it has the sandbox-style appeal of Super Mario Odyssey with the visual flair and story-based tones of a Horizon: Zero Dawn (or Zelda: Breath Of The Wild if you just can't get away from Nintendo). This is the first properly open-world Sonic game, and they seem to have nailed the idea of a world with plenty of things to do in it, collectibles, upgrades, challenges that test your knowledge and reaction time, and enemies that might seem cookie-cutter, but do manage to put up a real fight. Sonic's multitude of abilities ranging from the homing attack, light dash, stomp, boost, and more carry over from previous entries, while adding a host of new abilities that will help to both solve puzzles, string together clean lines through obstacle course-style design, and defeat the new enemies covering the surfaces of the Starfall Islands. They managed to move away from the God Of War-style combat from Unleashed and implement a combat system that rewards constant combos and varied combat moves with continual damage output. While some enemies are cannon fodder for even a basic homing attack, some enemies will require whole tasks like grinding a perfect circle to leapfrog into range, or a full-on chase sequence requiring you to close the gap to get the hit in. With proper sustained combos and combat, it's possible to defeat these enemies in a single cycle, and there's immense satisfaction when you can do so, especially just to avoid a more difficult second cycle.

Longtime fans have a lot to enjoy as well. While there's a ton to do in the open ""zones"" that make up the majority of the game's content, there are also cyberspace stages. This is sadly a downside to me for a pretty fair reason. Cyberspace stages are often laid out based on existing stage layouts from older games. There's wholesale copies of SA2 stages like Green Forest and Radical Highway, Unleashed stages like Apotos and Spagonia, Generations, Colors, and while that's a bit shameless, it's made worse by the lack of visual variety. There's a whopping FOUR level motifs used across 35 stages. Theoretically, you should be able to complete the entire game without playing the cyberspace stages, but it will definitely speed things, since every stage has 4 keys that will be used for the game's central collectible. Finishing one stage in 3 minutes sounds a lot better than spending those 3 minutes searching the zone for a single key.

Did I mention fishing yet? You can fish. You collect purple tokens and find a throne that will take you to Big's specialty fishing spot. You can fish in a Sonic game again. Hallelujah?

In an odd change of pace, Sonic Team has given players full control over the feeling of playing as Sonic. If you're confused, I mean that they give you a whole suite of sliders that change the very handling of Sonic in the world. Initial speed, handling, cornering, jump momentum, from 0 to 100, players are free to tune or untune Sonic like a guitar. This means it is entirely possible to either make the game feel slower than Mario Odyssey, or crank it like any number of Sonic fangames. That being said, the default settings are actually very comfortable, with only initial speed being cranked up later in my session. Sonic Team wants to make sure no matter who's playing, they will be able to play at their pace, and that's a great move for accessibility and control.

The story is the part that clearly tells me Sonic Team made this with series vets in mind, while also realizing that these characters are basically in their thirties. References to the past games will sometimes be told very directly, and the characters are all given pretty serious roles. That sounds laughable when you consider they're anthropomorphic creatures that fight a scientist with egg in his name, but they genuinely end up in fields of flowers or on cliff sides, coping with emotional traumas they had no way of preventing. The parallels to Breath Of The Wild keep coming up as the music is very much an ambient approach, letting the tunes feed into the tone that Sonic Team wanted to convey. I won't go into any further detail about it, you should really play the game if you want to know more and hear more.

As far as the PC release goes, it's a middling port. 60fps maximum with 30fps cutscenes, limited resolution options (no ultrawide). no modern upscaling features like DLSS or FSR, Denuvo DRM that caused first-hour headaches, and performance that seems to fluctuate, even on decent hardware like RTX cards. That said, it has been a fairly smooth experience for most users. For myself, I've actually played the entire adventure on the Steam Deck. Despite being unsupported, running with Proton Experimental, 720p with or without AA, and a 30fps framelock made for a very smooth venture, with the only complaints to have being that higher framerates would cause light flickering across the zones. While it would have been nice to see the game run at 60fps, it's been very playable, and I can average about 3 hours on a full charge playing the game. It also seems to natively support most controllers, as connecting a Dualshock will have the game show Playstation button prompts.

I'm ready to say that Sonic Frontiers is an overall great game, not simply a good Sonic game, but a great game in general. The open-world game trend might feel a bit tired, but for taking this long to do it, Sonic Team has pulled it off with flying colors. There's loads of content and things to do, a story that longtime fans will enjoy, but without requiring that context to understand it for a newcomer, many ways to play it with different handling options for Sonic, and it just feels fun to play. I'm not even close to done yet at 13 hours, and I expect I'll be playing a lot more of this game even after the credits roll.",,
VERY GOOOD GAME,,

"Sonic Frontiers is the first of what is told to be many similar games for the future series. Is this a good thing? Short answer; yes. Sonic Frontiers has the fun boost gameplay we've come to love, mixed with combat and RPG elements. With 5 vast open-zones to discover, and plenty of Cyberspace missions along the way, the game never lacks in something to do. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to any fans of Sonic, or Open-World games.",,
Crashes on Start up. Impossible to get it to do a window capture for streaming. I would be better off getting the console version and stream it that way. Went to change the graphics settings so it won't crash and it's installing the game a second time now with a 20 gig update. Steam version is buggy. don't buy.,,
Easily the best Sonic game that SEGA has given us since Generations! I've had so much fun leveling up Sonic and getting him new combat moves and exploring the islands. They have really fun challenges and puzzles to mess around with. The story is REALLY good and the music. OMG THE MUSIC! I'm not gonna spoil the first boss fight but man it gave me an adrenaline rush like holy $hit. The most fun I've had with Sonic in YEARS. Easy 8/10,,

In my hands I hold the ones I love
Walk forward through the cold dawn
Always to new horizons
Come with me
We'll travel through the trials and tragedy
Rest and bloom

Their secrets in their melodies?
Dream, explore the mysteries
Break, a new life is revealed to me
Once again we'll start our story anew
Don't be afraid, I will be with you
I'm here
Reaching far across these new frontiers
With my life I fight this fear
In my hands I hold the ones I love
Walk forward through the cold dawn
Always to new horizons
Standing here
The way ahead's becoming clear
All across these new frontiers
In my hands I hold the ones I love
Walk forward through the cold dawn

Best 3d sonic game in a long time. The game has a few problems like somewhat annoying camera movement and some bugs (probably will be fixed by day 1 patch) but this game's pros definitely outweigh the cons. 8/10 definitely worth,,
"After 100%'ing the game and all it's glory, I can confidently say that this game is not only my new favorite sonic game (sorry unleashed and heroes) but my personal GOTY. It's in no way a perfect game however, it has it's flaws (pop-ins, janky stuff, etc...) and once you reach the third island and beyond, the game loses it's shine, but overall, I really enjoyed my time with the game and I am hoping that sonic team keeps this formula and improves upon it and have more people work on another mainline sonic title. Overall, would I say that it's worth the full $60? Not really. But on sale? most definitely. It is a very good treat of a game.",,
"You know a game franchise has truly expired when a hot mess of great ideas poorly executed is welcomed by critics who consider it a step in the right direction. Sonic Frontiers has nice open world visuals, a great soundtrack and passable storytelling. The core gameplay shows promise, but once you're in movement puzzles and combat the cracks show wider and wider. The action-platforming is slippery, inconsistent and full of minor issues with camera, targeting, buggy collision, auto-movement off cliffs etc which add up over time to the point where I uninstalled and refunded within an hour. Also the game crashed every time I tried to browse Graphics Settings. :/

The open world approach is valid - I would have settled for a less overambitious, less buggy, more polished game.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is one of a kind game. It feels nice to have a really fun platforming game with a serious story. I highly recommend this game to both long time and casual fans. This is also a decent entree game for the series, though it does reference a lot of the old games.

Sonic's move set is a lot of fun to mess around with, especially when you unlock every single skill. Doing different combos to see how fast you can defeat an enemy, performing tricks after launching yourself off of the terrain with boost, completing cyberspace levels as fast as possible, it's all really fun. The Boss Fights are actually insane and are one of the best fights in the entire series. Each one has a unique vocal song and you use what you learn from the island to beat them. They all have a theme.

Cyberspace is definitely a weak part of the game but it's still fun, the levels at the start are very weak but once you get to the second or third island they pick up in quality. Like really, they go from reusing level layouts to being full on original, throwing in new mechanics like drifting and skateboarding segments. My favorite cyberspace levels are definitely the ones from the final island.

Story Wise (No Spoilers) is good. There's a lot of mystery and it's really fun to explore and try piecing everything together. Sage is a very interesting character, Sonic is no longer one dimensional and has his practices and morals challenged, and believe it or not, this game has character development for the entire cast! I won't lie there were parts of the story that felt like they were doing damage control for the past 10 years, but they managed to make it work for the story. There are no longer 2 planets, there is no longer a classic and modern time line, and humans exist outside of just Robotnik. This game is better experienced blind.

This game definitely is receiving some harsh ratings from critics outside of steam, which is as expected but you should go in and make your own opinion, and if you like it please leave a review. It is important for this franchise to receive as much positive feedback as possible since it is gaming's punching bag, but also be honest. This is one of my new favorite games in the franchise.

EDIT: I finished the story, and it's really good. You need to play this game.",,
"Terrible frame rate, bad story but not the worst so i'm going to give it a 5/10",,

"Anaemic as ♥♥♥♥

I'll be upfront, I'm not a sonic fan and I find the majority of the Sonic fandom super irritating. I *wanted* to hate this game.

Positives:

So, controlling Sonic can be rather fun, like doing the air dash, the loopy loop thing to encircle enemies and stuff like that. Very enjoyable at times.

Running around the world as the speedy blue boi is also fun, I can't deny that, it's just a shame the speedy boi can also a glitchy boi.

When it isn't glitching out I can see the esence of a good game, screaming for more time in the oven.
The 'Meh' - Doesn't directly effect me / opinionated

Graphics are really, really bad, no lighting effects. no flair.

Music: never been a fan of the Sonic soundtrack, only a very select few I can say I enjoy, this is preference I understand but that's my opinion.

The arcade / classic levels, again, these have little effect on me as a non Sonic kid, sure some people will get a kick out of seeing the Green Hill Zone for the 100th time.

The animation quality: I've seen more effort put into Sonic fan games and older, official Sonic games. Sadly everyone's favourite blue boi has osteoporosis, stiff ass all hell.

The bad - This is ♥♥♥♥ that's bad.

World: Looks generic af, legit looks like someone followed an Unreal 5 map creation tutorial and decided to import it into the game. No, before you say, the 'Alwien worlb' is no excuse for visuals devoid of creativity. I've seen armature projects with more character.

The game is a buggy mess, at the time of this review 11/11/2022; I've experienced the following bugs:

After dying, the game reloads and gets stuck at 12 fps, not even quitting and relaunching the game fixes this, only fix
is to turn the graphics down, load into the game, and then put them back to as you had them.

Sonic can just be too cool to follow my commands, multiple times during the second boss, the big 3 leggi boy; he will
just *not* dash attack the target, leading to countless times of dying because he just stood there, or even worse, he
would just fall out of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sky.

They will patch it i prwomis -It's a buggy mess and the daddy long legs boss kept glitching me in and out of their body,
sometimes the loop drawing mechanic would just not count what I did as a loop and wiff and finally, the pop in, holy

REFUNDED THIS GAME.
DOES NOT WORK OFFLINE!

A single player offline game that can’t even be played offline??? All because they want to force us to check into a server to verify the game isn’t illegitimate when it will eventually be broken anyways? My HTPC Console is 100% offline, doesn’t even connect to the local network unless I want to transfer my games, and will remain that way, this is unacceptable.

People keep defending “Denuvo” for god knows what reasons, yet it always gets broken for major games anyways yet paying customers like us are forced to deal with an inferior product while people that illegitimately get this game for free will get a BETTER PRODUCT.

Sega has become a sad HORRIBLE company to support this and not the powerhouse I remember from the 90’s.

Boycott ANY game with DENUVO. I accidentally bought this because I had no idea Sega would stoop so low as to use this horrid copyright protection on it that does nothing but hurt their own customers. I will just use the switch version and not support this horrible anti-customer business practices.

TLDR: 0/10 Would Refund Again.",,
"Hands down, The BEST Sonic game I have ever played!

The story is fantastic, acknowledging older games with references both direct and subtle.
The game play is fun and engaging, controls will get you killed as many time as the bosses, bur it wouldn't be a 3D sonic game without that.
Visually its stunning, Sonic fits in to the world very well and it never really feels like you're playing a cartoon character in a real world setting.
The Soundtrack is above and beyond, both atmospheric in the world, heart pumping during the cyber space levels, and astoundingly good during boss battles
Overall, this really is the Sonic Adventure 3 we've all been waiting for.
Highly HIGHLY Recommended!",,

YESSSSSSSSSSS finally a sonic game where i actually got my money worth, if your new to sonic, just play the first game like how could have not grew up playing it unless your below 12 yrs old",,
"The game has a 60 FPS lock. The sequences are limited to 30 FPS. What is that about?
Sonic Frontiers ignores G-Sync and V-Sync doesn't work either. The graphics also look very modest (port from the Switch).
You can do something about the 60 FPS lock and the V-Sync problem -> install SpecialK. At this point a big thank you to SpecialK.

Controls take some getting used to, there's a bit of physics jank, and a bunch of the game's ideas and concepts don't seem implemented as well as they could have been. But that doesn't matter a whole lot when the game is fun. It's fun running around and doing all the little platforming segments and quests, or just running around for no reason. The minibosses are interesting to fight.

Assuming they don't do their usual strategy of starting from scratch for every game, there's a lot of potential for improvement for a sequel.

I bought it in the sale for 30€, but that's still too much.",,
"I 100% this game so I can tell you definitively to not play it. There are so many things that break your pace. There are a million ideas that were good, but implemented poorly (such as a skill tree that you don't have to choose between, because it is so easy to max). T

he game takes tons of cues from better open worlds, without asking itself why the elements it copied were successful in other games. This ultimately led to tons of challenges that weren't challenging, and were either boring or frustrating without ever being fun.

Ultimately, the thing that got me to finish this was the sunken cost fallacy and a tiny bit of interest in the average to above average story line that still managed to be tone deaf from time to time. What got me to 100% it, was that I never want to ever come back to this game, ever again. Forever.",,

"So. Here we are again. Sonic Team, a game studio that has never, ever produced a finished, polished game, is trying for the open world. And the open world runs fine. Sonic handles fine, they finally figured out how to make him move in 3D without being a twitchy spaz or a slippery mess. But once again, the coding has escaped them. The open world runs fine, but inside the action stages, at least on PC, the game freezes every few seconds, rendering it unplayable. While fighting minibosses, the arena bugs out, you lose the ability to target things, and will eventually get trapped in the miniboss's model. So, they got a top notch writer, they got rid of Yuji Naka so the game plays somewhat decently, but just like every other title Sonic Team has ever touched: Sonic 1, NiGHTS, Sonic Adventure, Sonic Adventure 2, Sonic Heroes, Sonic Forces, Sonic Unleashed, Sonic Colors, every single title, the jank is what kills it. It's like they don't have anyone test these games. They develop them on Xbox or Playstation, then port them to PC and just ship it. Sonic Team should be dissolved completely and Sonic games should be given to some other team within Sega or, maybe, we just retire the property altogether and admit that Sega is not good at making games at all.",,
"We won't back down, we won't
(Yeah, yo)
I'm here to go beyond my limit, not to compromise
And you can tell me if I mean it, looking in my eyes
Cause I've been waiting for my moment to strike
So come close, let me show you what it's like
Yeah, you can try to stand in my path
But you're gonna regret it
I'll be the one who laughs last
While I’m making my exit
Cause this is only for the strong of heart
Not if you get it
And no matter what the outcome
You better accept it
I can cut right through steel
I can bury thе pain
So go down for a second
Just get out of my way (Out of my way)
You cheat and you steal
I'm not lеtting it go
So take this as a lesson
Cause it's all that we know
Will the whole world know your name
When we dance with destiny?
Yea, I've been there, and I've seen it
I'm never gonna stop believing
You'll find your flame
Oh, we can save the day
(The day!)
We won't back down, we won't
(Yeah, alright)
It's like I'm seeing double vision
Take a seat, I'm on a mission
We got everything to gain (Everything to gain, yeah)
To become everything you're not
You just give it all you got
And take the pleasure with the pain
Yeah I can feel my fire awaken
No time for being complacent
There's a dream on the horizon
You know we gotta chase it
And when we get to where we're going
Then we start the invasion
Best me? Naw, you must be mistaken (Hey)
You know I'll turn you into rust
Grind you right down to dust
You thought you were the best
Well, you haven’t met us
I'll bring the fire and rain
Call me the hurricane
I'm not letting it go
Cause it's all that I know
Will the whole world know your name (Know your name)
When we dance with destiny? (Destiny)
Yea, I've been there, and I've seen it
I'm never gonna stop believing
You'll find your flame
Now here we go, it's the end of the show
Hear them, they're calling your name
Cause in the end
It's you and your friends
You'll find your flame (Go!)
Now here we go, it's the end of the show
Hear them, they're calling your name

"Nothing in this game works in favour of the player. Hitting a ramp with boost can launch you way over and past the platform you're trying to land on, or it can completely cancel your momentum and drop you straight down to your death. You never know what's going to work, and you also don't know what the developers intended to work. Wall climbing? Pretty straightforward, right? No, the devs decided to change player input so that pressing left, which you assume would make you run along the wall to the left, will instead make you go down diagonally, effectively running off the wall to your death. Pressing up goes up/right diagonally and pressing right makes you go straight down. I'm not even joking. There's also no freedom in ""open-world"" Sonic. You are constantly fighting against speed boosts, bumpers and railings sending you in the wrong direction. Maybe this wouldn't be a problem if there wasn't pop-in for every object further than 30 feet. Even better would be an arrow at the start of a path so you know which paths will send you where you want to go. You also get locked into ""car"" mode but only on specific paths and levels. I really don't get why they put all this work into an engine only to force you into an auto-scroller where your only option is to veer left or right at a snail's pace and hit everything or dash so far to either side that you miss every ring and accidentally go into spikes. Some smaller annoyances are having no control over sonic in the air, losing all momentum as soon as you jump, having no momentum to begin with because non-boost movement speed is awful, but trying to correct that by boosting will make you overshoot by several miles, even boosting in the air is a recipe for death, but your only other option for air movement is 1 double jump that barely moves Sonic an extra inch from where he started. Like I said, nothing works.

I'm convinced all the positive reviews are from Sonic fans too accustomed to their games being godawful, so that when a game that isn't completely jank comes by it's the best game in the world. I will say the music is always a jam, the engine can be satisfying, combat can be fun, bosses are amazing, and some levels are really fun. It just feels like it needed more time to cook before release. When the game works seamless it's the most fun I've had since Generations, but when you're going for an S time and the game decides that Sonic didn't grab the auto-grabbing zipwire that the boost pads literally threw him at, causing you to die and have to restart, only for a similar hiccup to happen elsewhere in the stage on a ramp after working fine for several runs, it makes me want to shave my head, grow a walrus stache and burn down a nearby forest full of furry critters.",,

And glitches, lots and lots of glitches, i specially waited to buy this game so i would get the patched game.... its still bad, not like unplayable but enougth to have Sonic go trought platforms and walls....",,

"Been an avid Sonic fan for years. I first fell in love with it when I played Sonic 2 on the Sega Genesis. This game just isn't a classic Sonic game, nor a good way to effectively execute a modern Sonic game and introduce some new gameplay concepts.

The stages are recycled levels from previous games which was already done in Sonic Generations and Sonic Forces, and the levels that are new were extremely glitchy. The storyline was difficult to follow and the game itself was repetitive except the support character changed and the map. And even in the parts where Sonic was free roaming, the camera would switch from 3D to 2D with no warning and make the game extremely frustrating at times.

I did enjoy the free roaming aspect of the game, just wish there was a little more guidance at times. This had great potential, just not executed to it's fullest capacity.",,
"this game is simply a 10/10 banger very good EXCEPT FOR LEVEL 1-2 THAT SUCKS WHY WOULD THEY MAKE THE TIMER 55 SECOND LIKE WHO THE HELL WENT TO WORK AND SAID ""hmm what if i made the second level in the game be the hardest to get an s rank on it would be so funny if they had to be precise with their movements"" LIKE WHAT THE HELL I HOPE THAT ♥♥♥♥ GETS FIRED the level itself is fine tho it has banger music looks cool yknow a normal level BUT THE RANK TIMES ARE RIDICULOUS HOPE THAT GUY GOES STRAIGHT TO THE BOILER ROOM OF HELL LIKE IM TALKING STRAIGHT INTO THE BOILER BURNING ALIVE FOR ALL ETERNITY I DESPISE THIS MAN AND YET I DONT EVEN KNOW HIM. anyway other then that minor flaw the game is awesome",,
"This game WAS fun, until I came to the second island boss. whoever thought that a sonic game needs a parry mechanic NEEDS to be FIRED. it is unwieldy, clunky and the timing window for attacks very WILDLY, sometimes you need to be frame perfect and other times you can hit the button a literal second early and it will still count. That isn't even the worst of it, not only do you need to parry the bosses swipe attack (which is inconsistent AT BEST) but given how super sonic has sparks coming off of him YOU CANNOT SEE THE BOSSES MISSILES COMING AT YOU AT ALL. This boss should have NEVER passed playtesting and has ruined the entire game for me, if you know ANYONE who has this game and has yet to play it I beg you to tell them to get a refund, this game is NOT worth the money as it is right now. Unless this boss is overhauled and/or the parry mechanic fixed it will never be worth the money.",,
"it is really good and all, but why cant the game atleast use 5gb of system ram for better performance, and a custom launcher (which tells how much ram (in mb) the game should use and experimental settings.)",,
sonc,,
My review on this game has changed since I have fixed the error of the game not launching. Now I can enjoy everything this game has to offer without being restricted from playing it. Sonic Team's first attempt at creating an open world (or open zone) Sonic game is a strong start! It's just fun to run around. But when you start modding this game it get's even better. I recommend modding this game after completing the vanilla story.,,
"I really like this game's gusto. It feels like the first time in a long time where Sonic Team actually really gave it their all, and while there are some things I really love about this game, the flaws are so numerous and gaping that I really can't recommend it at all.

This is definitely the best written Sonic game since Black Knight. There was an attempt to add weight to these characters and it really paid off. Even though the cutscenes were really stilted and boring looking the performances made up for it somewhat. Despite using the same cast from Forces they all sound wildly different and much more mellow, which I think is a change for the better. Mike Pollock was excellent in this game. It was pretty jarring how many references to previous games there were, though. I don't know what kid in 2022 knows who Dark Gaia is (because they never ported the damn thing past 7th gen hardware.)

The other positive this game has going for it is, of course, the Titan fights with Super Sonic (though the last one was pretty lame). The gameplay is pretty rudimentary thanks to parrying not being on a timer but the music and spectacle made these excellent to play, and for a very brief moment brought me back to the 1998-2009 golden age of the 'hog (my idea of a golden age anyway). The promise of more metalcore showdowns at the end of each section was the only thing keeping me going through this game. I didn't think a game could rival Metal Hellsinger for best ost of 2022 but it came really close.

Everything starts to fall apart once you're sent back to the open world. The core gameplay loop involves grabbing collectibles, killing minibosses to get keys to unlock boost stages to get different keys to get chaos emeralds, and every part of the process is so abysmal that by the last island I was skipping anything and everything I didn't absolutely need.

Memory Tokens, items you find at the end of mini platforming challenges dotted around the game like a gmod custom map, became a chore to find very quickly. The challenges themselves are extremely boring, with no incentive to do them quickly or properly. You'll see all you need to see from them in the first island, yet the game crams hundreds more down your throat. You will quickly be trying to find ways to skip to the end of them, jumping off cliffs and such to grab the token midair.

Gears are earned from these Minibosses, that are either over in ten seconds or feature horrible lengthy scripted segments where you can't do any damage to them. They're all repeated frequently, too, so you'll have to hold on to the tail of that shark or ride that flying squid's purple ♥♥♥♥ trail many, many times. I avoided these, and every other combat encounter, like the plague as soon as I had enough gears for the island.

Cyberspace boost levels are actually insulting. Not only are they still reusing the same decade old Sonic Generations assets for nearly every stage (the ones that don't are a single generic highway setting), but they are, with a completely straight face, reusing level layouts from previous 3d games as well. The music was nice, and I'm glad S ranks are now completely based on timing now, but these felt like a total slap in the face. I only did half of them, just to get enough keys.

Please do not buy this game. It was clearly rushed despite the enormous wait between Forces and this, and everything they did include is frustratingly dull. Watch the first 3 titan fights on Youtube (playing them doesn't take much more effort) and listen to the soundtrack. If you're a huge Sonichead like me, watch the cutscenes too and appreciate the writing.

3/10

Addendum:

In the future, among other smaller additions, three playable characters in the form of Tails, Knuckles and Amy will be added to the game. They are the safe, Genesis era inclusions and may not pan out so great in execution, but I seriously appreciate that they're finally recognizing the love these side characters get. All three of these 'hogs haven't been playable in a mainline 3d game in 16 years (unless you count Sir Gawain from Black Knight), and the increasing recognition the 6/7th gen games are getting gives me hope that my hero Silver will finally get another shot. When this update is implemented, even if it sucks, I'm raising the score to a 4/10, as lame as the reasoning is.",,
This game seems like it could be optimized better. It runs like garbage at 4K with a 4090. That's not even the reason why I bought it. I bought it so that i could play it on my Steam Deck. It's such a disappointment because I really enjoyed what I was able to play. I like they soundtrack and sound effects. I truly enjoy the instances in each world where you can run through a level and gather red coins and such. Those fmv sequences look like they were built for PS3 back in 2007. The game is good but being locked at 60fps is a showstopper for me. Even then it dips in some places which is inexcusable because I can get 110fps on CyberPunk 2077 with Psycho RTX settings. If the console versions run smoother I might just pick this up on PS5. If you're a hardcore Sonic fan then I recommend this game. You'll love it. I'm just an FPS snob.,,

"The game is great!
The music is amazing, and the fights and everything about this game made it my favorite sonic game right now but I only give it a 9 because it wasn't giving its very all with sonic’s moves and difficulty.

My issues with the game.

Parry is too accessible (should be a skill check) sonic releasing a shield or block would have made parry so sick, rewarding you (sonic-time.) Remember, Sega you can make games hard. That's what hard mode is for. Give us the option for easy buttons for accessibility but not for free. MAKE ME GET GOOD AT SONIC

1-2 should be the base idea of all S ranks going forward to make sonic fans think hard for their perfect runs (please? that was so fun to speedrun until I got it) do not give me an S for making mistakes Especially in hard mode. MAKE ME CRY.

Cyloop is overpowered giving you rings for nothing made it too easy especially in fights
if it had a cooldown or didn't give a lot of rings per loop. That would fix the issue.

The skill tree is way too small. I wanted to fight everything but once I got the skill points I had no reason to fight anymore. Putting the points into upgrades would have made it so much better as you would have to manage getting moves and upgrading your skills. Sonic should have been doing no damage at all from the time you get to the second island with no damage upgrades. Make people suffer for being stupid and fighting something when they aren't ready. People should fail for being dumb. It teaches them to get better.

The Boss before the final boss was a pushover I should have been struggling but instead I was so strong that he died the first time I fought them.

The ring Limit is too high at the start. 100 should be enough and frankly, it should punish you for not having more in supersonic fights.

Listen, Sega / Sonic team. You have something good here. It's a good base hold on to this for dear life and, improve on the idea. update the game to fix some of the flaws and lag spikes. Make the times for cyberspace hard in hard mode, and for the love of god Sega. Stop treating us like kids, this hedgehog is so cool and I love this little bastard but all I want is for him to have that sonic polish feel. Remove the forces model and give him back his generations model or fuse the two sonic forces models. The story was good but give the other characters a chance or work on DLC to give the other characters stuff to do, they aren’t powerless.

I don’t hate the game but I see something great going forward. Make it happen I believe in you guys.",,

"Of course being a sonic fan almost kind of requires being overly critical of every game that isn't from at the very latest: 2010. That may be partially because of nostalgia and not ""getting with the times,"" but what I've observed is that newer sonic games lack the direction and the integrity that older games had. And no, I'm not talking about the genesis games, they were archaic bare-bones platformers that most people only really like because they liked it when they were kids (not that that's a bad thing).

The adventure games, Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic 06 in a timeline where it's actually good, Colors, Unleashed (sort of?).
They had a charm that Forces certainly doesn't, and now Sonic Frontiers is lacking in as well.

The characters' personality and voices have all been subdued, made background to the gameplay loop which would be a mistake even if the gameplay loop was good (which it arguably is not). Sacrificing the story and characters is not only pointless but has not contributed to any inalienable quality found in this game that wasn't present in the games previously listed under the category of ""the good ones."" Essentially we've been forced to adapt from good story, mid game to bad story, mid game. That's not a tradeoff, it's a downgrade. Sonic sounds okay, I guess? But Tails and Amy are unrecognizable, especially Amy. And her dialogue has suffered too, losing any of the spice that came with her obsessive personality, now she's just one of sonic's friends with no distinguishing traits of any kind (other than she's the only girl, I guess?). Tails on the other hand seems to have completely reverted to Forces' ""point-ass-at-threat-and-cry"" mode with weak dialogue and again: no real personality trait other than being friends with Sonic. Talis is an inventor, he made the Tornado, he is both useful and interesting...but not in this game. I have not yet seen any other cameos, but I'd imagine they probably aren't much better, as they exist nowhere in the promotional art. Eggman is here, also weakened and frankly lacking in his comically exaggerated manner. His role in the plot seems to be mostly arbitrary here, not unlike Forces and the general trend away from the formulaic Sonic vs. Eggman plotlines (which can be a good thing, it's just not one here).

The gameplay, the thing that SONIC TEAM has supposedly mastered here, is only slightly better than forces, and is not better to an extent to excuse the black hole that is the plot and characters. Boost is back. I feel I need not say more but I will anyway. They ALMOST removed it in favor of the spin dash, but I guess that would've been to difficult. There's now a maximum limit for rings in the free-roam """"""open world,"""""" set to 400 that can be upgraded as you play. The only problem is that reaching 400 rings stored (assuming you're not a complete bot) is incredibly easy and I did it in 10-15 minutes (and that's after being hit a few times). Rings after this limit are pointless, completely pointless. There is no score system in the hub world, and you don't gain XP for collecting rings past the limit, so ring hunting is truly useless since you will get the rings you need on your way and hit the cap for it anyway before you get the chance to upgrade.

SERIOUSLY. It's not hard. The levels already do this and they're like a minute long. JUST REMOVE THE LIMIT FOR RINGS. IT IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE.

There's also a dumbass skill tree now? So you can unlock different moves as you play, which is stupid because Sonic has always had a high skill ceiling with basic mechanics that are given to you from day 1, level 1, meaning that beginners won't have to focus on unlocking moves they don't know how to use, and pros can use those expert level moves immediately instead of having to artificially wait?

That's what this game is, by the way: just a bunch of artificially waiting. Cutscenes that look less polished than gameplay, random and pointless grind rails and speed boosters to make you think you're playing a sonic game, boss intros for enemies I beat in 30 seconds, time spent in menus looking for the one thing the tutorial won't shut up about unlocking or changing, tutorial missions that are unskippable and require constant input for things you already know how to use demonstrably, LEARNING THINGS YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN TAUGHT 3 TIMES.

Hey do you know how to homing attack? It's not jump anymore, silly! It's X.
Oh cool. Got it.
Hey do you know how to homing attack?
Yes, I've been doing it for 15 minutes now I've got-
It's not jump anymore, silly! It's X.
YES I KNOW CAN YOU GET BACK TO THE GAME PLEASE?
...
...
Hey do you know-

It is simply a waste of time, like how that bit was a waste of review space. Maybe some of you reading this wish I didn't just take up 8 lines for that, like how I wish Sonic Frontiers didn't tell me how to perform basic elementary moves 3+ times. And of course, icing on the cake, the game does not look 2022 standards for a triple-A game, the controls are confusing and arbitrarily unintuitive, and worst of all: it seems barely finished and slapped together FNAF: Security Breach style. There are plenty of terrain bugs if you go looking for them.

I have not played through it all, and I very well might. If my opinion changes, I will update and add addendum do my review. But as it stands, Sonic Frontiers is hollow, shallow, barely fun sometimes, and generally not worthy of being added to the ""good ones"" list. Plus it's 60 dollars, which is ridiculous.

5/10. SEGA, if you're reading this, finish your game, and maybe for the next one try to move away from the hollow lifeless boost model that you seem so desperate to cling to for dear life.",,

"Anti consumer. It cant be played without being connected to the internet. This game should be boycotted for this alone, being online only - only stops people from playing the game and just promotes piracy. Stop adding this anti consumer crap into games!

Regarding the game itself: The game is good, I refused to go near it until it had been reviewed due to previous titles.. and how mashed together Sonic Origins was. But this game is good, it's worth playing. Yes it has some issues, the pop in is pretty bad, and that spam attack where you can just hold one button belongs in Dragon Ball NOT Sonic.. wtf even is that?

This game is however a good game, it's a good direction that SEGA and Sonic Team have finally taken, and its paid off. A bit overpriced.. and the online only anti consumer denuvo crap is a disgusting corporate practise, but it's worth acknowledging that the game itself is good if this is the direction the dev team are going to continue in.

You'll most likely enjoy the game. My main gripes are the anti consumer practises mentioned above, the stupid DBZ style spam attack, and the time between things like the homing attack and the stomp mechanics - those mechanics need to be tighter/quicker, decrease the time between lock ons ect and Sonic will feel a ton faster. But that aside, the games a good game. SEGA yet again begin to redeem themselves. Get rid of denuvo and were onto a winner.",,

It's super fun to run around and do things, most of the cyber space levels are good, and I absolutely love the writing. Seriously, all the characters feel pretty dang amazing.",,
"This is sincerely the best 3D Sonic game since Generations back in 2011. Except unlike Generations the story doesn't suck. I won't spoil but this game genuinely makes me happy and I haven't been this proud to be a Sonic fan since Generations released. It's an easy 9/10 from me.

Everything about the gameplay blends really well together and you get an understanding of what the development team meant by ""open zone"". The controls are fluid, the combat is extremely fun and fast-paced, the worlds are detailed, etc. This is one of the few open world type games that actually made me want to traverse the world and have fun with it. Also, this soundtrack man. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is it a BANGER through and through.

I only have 4 complaints against this game. There is a technical issue with pop-in, which in a more speedy and reactive platformer like Sonic, really should not happen. I understand this game had to be made with Switch in mind but some implementation of DirectStorage would fix this and be greatly appreciated.

Levelling up with Elder Koco for Rings and Speed kinda stinks, which is bizarre because Hermit Koco is so easy and straight forward. Since it's a single collectible, you have to select what you wanna level up one-by-one every time, even when you maxed out one stat. Took me half an hour to go from lvl 50 to max. Also, selecting ""No thanks"" means Elder will just take those kocos and not give you the level ups. Fine if you're trying to limit yourself, but that's just plain dirty.

Cyberspace is definitely the weakest part of the game. The stages themselves are fun and chock full of alternate pathways, but the 2D controls and weirdly low speed cap ruin it. I don't know how Sonic Team did it but they managed to make it just a tiny bit worse than Forces.

Last but not least, the secret final boss is kind of a disappointment. You have to play on Hard to get it and it does feel hard but...not quite what I expected from a Sonic final boss. You can tell poor small Sonic Team was starting to run out of steam.

I'd very much recommend it. This is the best Sonic has been in years and it's absolutely kino. If this is the direction to be taken for the next decade, like Iizuka said, I am very excited to see how it evolves. It's groundbreaking just like SA1 was.",,

Received this game via Fanatical sales which was discounted and coupon to further make it affordable for the Deluxe Edition. Paid about under $38 for it. Regular MSRP about over $61.59 pre/launch price of the Deluxe.

Being a Early player to the title can have its benefits/cons.

On one hand. You get to play the game on Launch and subsequent days if you dabble on the game on and off to broadcast it to hardly anyone to watch you. As typical to most content creators that do gameplay coverage (heh) experiencing the game at your leisure with hardly any outside interference or spoilers.

On the other. The game is in a slight buggy mess which can cause crashes and issues if your PC is low Spec (Such as my toaster with the NVIDIA 780 )

If I were to be blunt about this, SEGA and SUPERFANS (People who are Content Creators that are given Pre-Launch Coverage Keys to broadcast it) somewhat spoiled a bit too much on Social Media in hyping the game so some magic were gone in diving into the game without any surprises past the 2nd boss. The game was trending so much on Twitter and feeds that alot of the game Early and Middle got spoiled and revealed to generate hype for the title.

While it worked and people are now playing it, myself included. I wished I went into the game without *ANY* knowledge of what's to come within the game.

Anyways under 23 Hours of play (with an additional 1+ Hour of checking out the Deluxe Edition extras with the Mini Soundtrack and goodies) I was able to enjoy the game throughout regardless of the spoilers that were shown in Social Media despite the Filters being set up and constantly people sharing information of the game.

Strengths: A bit more exposition of lore behind the precursors of beings referenced in Sonic 3 and Knuckles and Sonic Adventure. The first one. Not the Second.

New Character: Sage the Artificial Girl- She is somewhat better than Infinite at *least* on giving a story guideline to push the story across. Actually feels like she belongs in the story and had a presence all throughout. She doesn't do much aside from that until the *Very End* for the most part she is the Story Giver to give the player/Sonic/Cast explanation of what is going on in the Star Fall Islands

The Ancients/The Precursors/The Koco/The Beings before all else inhabiting Sonic's World are revealed as teased from previous games *Loosely from Sonic Boom too*, if you do pick this game up and plan to play through it. You will be treated with a nice exposition of what became of them and how the regions of Starfall Islands are to be as it were.


The Bad: Elder & Hermit Koco- aside from updating Sonic in his specs, they offer no additional story-lore aside from 1 cutscene near the beginning. Plus, updating Sonics' skills can be somewhat tedius if you are swapping Ring for Speed and Vice Versa. The Devs set it up that you have to repeatedly click the menu multiple times instead of setting a amount to transfer.

The Story: There is much left to be desired about the lore regarding Sonic's world and the inhabitants before Sonic and friends existence. As I said before. Sonic Adventure, Sonic 3 and Knuckles and a few other titles before hand were referenced all throughout the game between the cast of Sonic and friends. More questions rather than answers were given throughout and regardless of some reveals within the game and its plot.
It somewhat falls short? Especially at the end.

There are 5 Islands of Starfall Islands: Kronos, Ares, Chaos, Rhea, and Ouranos. Each of the 5 is named after the Ancients. You might find that Chaos and Sonic has alot in common upon retrospect.

Each region is relatively well spread out with paths opening up the more you run through and solve puzzles throughout. Plenty of things to grab along the way to help you progress through the story.

I aim to play the game again in the future via PS4 with Remote Play and I hope that I won't encounter crashes/bugs as I have in the PC port.

Its serviceable to say the least. The music as usual sets the mood and pacing. Especially in the Titan Fights. Its an improvement over Sonic Forces that's for sure.

But if Sega wishes to expand upon Sonic's world and it's characters.

Its about time Sonic and his friends go their separate ways and find their own paths through life.


Overall. I enjoyed it. You should too.

Open World Games are often more Fetch Questy and such but thanks to Sonic's speed and quick traveling. It wasn't mundane.",,
"This game is fundamentally flawed in nearly every way. Every single mechanic feels like a band-aid to fix issues that arose from some other fix. Sonic controls horribly and the cyber levels just do not work with this physics engine. It's not a terrible game or the worst Sonic game, but it's really bad and I do not understand for the life of me why people are giving this great reviews.",,
"I didn't expected to have 70 hours (by the time I'm editing this review) in this game.

TLDR; the game is not for everyone and I don't blame anyone for not liking it as it has a lot of rough edges even with The Final Horizon update, It's really a big mixed bag of ideas which some work and some don't.

As for me personally, I'll probably keep playing it as I'm a stinky Sonic fan and idk I guess I like this game",,

"Story:
Filled with holes and clashing tones. Normally the story of a Sonic game wouldn't be quite as important, but in this case, the game takes the story very seriously. If the story was better written, it would have improved my experience by a lot. Instead, it was distracting.

Game-play:
Sonic controls nicely in this game, but it does get very repetitive.

Other:

The world feels empty. You can 100% the game rather quickly and easily, which makes the game feel short and lacking in content.

I really enjoyed some of the boss battles (especially the music).",,
"This game is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boring. Ive 100% it twice (to warrant my thoughts and remove bias) and i hate it so much. Its so devoid of any fun things that i like about sonic. Its so repetitive and unrewarding. The only thing relatively good about it is the story, and it even ♥♥♥♥♥ that up at the end with probably the most underwhelming final bossfight. I hate the lack of care put into designing and polishing the environment and the fighting is so underdeveloped.

Such a ♥♥♥♥ game and a waste of money.",,
"To be clear, I've left this game in the background for days at a time, hence my time-card, but in actuality I'm right near the end of the game and I've maybe invested 4 hours? Could've been a lot less if I knew the fishing spots could grant me chaos emerald vaults from the beginning. Anyway, onto the review, and this has to be the laziest, most pointless game Sega has ever spat out. In the 6 months since the release Sega have seemingly made no attempt to improve ANY of the glaring faults in this game. I'm going to break this review down into categories:

Level design:

There are two sections to this, the open-world islands, and the ""cyberspace"" levels. Let's tackle the ""cyberspace"" levels first. What are ""cyberspace"" levels exactly? Dotted around the open-world islands are gates, these gates transport Sonic to more traditional 3D Sonic stages (think Generations/Colors type gameplay), but the trouble is these ""cyberspace"" levels typically only last from 30 seconds to a minute and a half, and literally ALL of them utilise one of four basic texture packs, Green Hill, Chemical Plant, Sky Sanctuary, and what appears to be Unleashed's Empire City.

Yes, that's right, you'll only be seeing these 4 places, crudely reorganised over and over with basic track design ripped from earlier games. I hope you're ready for more Green Hill Zone, because it appears in this game a staggering NINE times. Things don't get better as you'll also be revisiting Chemical Plant Zone seven times, and Sky Sanctuary six times. Yes, recycling assets is a hallmark of Sonic games, but this is ridiculous. Cyberspace levels are supposed to be a homage to previous Sonic games, but instead they feel like a free-trial version of Sonic Generations, a game released over a decade ago that already depended heavily on retreading worn ground, but at least Generations had more than double the variety for level texturing.

Now onto the open-world islands, and these really are horrifying. 6 months after release and the game still suffers from the worst and most frequent pop-in rendering issues that I've ever seen in my entire life. Rails, platforms, springs, they all appear out of nowhere once you get within proximity. Every island feels like a disjointed mash, as though someone started a Unity project last night and just started dumping assets wherever.

This random mashing together of elements has other issues too. You can be locked into a 2D perspective improperly if you cross within some defined platforming areas, and the colouration of these islands makes identifying Koco (one of an endless number of collectables) difficult. Seriously, why task me with finding things the colour and texture of stone, in places filled with stone? It's pretty obvious the reason these Koco creatures dance around so much is to counterbalance this obvious oversight.

Enemy AI:

What AI? You won't find any here. Whether it's little robots that fall apart with one hit or gigantic bosses that take time, they all follow a disturbingly rigid fixed pattern. Have you walked 30ft away from the enemy? Good news, the enemy has no memory of ever seeing you. Are you standing behind a fence that comes up to Sonic's knees? Might as well be an impenetrable moat because god only knows how the robots will take 2 steps to the left to walk around and get you, such logic is well beyond their capabilities.

Progression:

The game has a system of skill points and collectables governing Sonic's speed, defence, attack, and ring capacity. Ring capacity is essentially worthless because you start with 400, and can easily leech rings out of the ground itself with nothing more than a quick spin. I maxed out Speed too but found no noticeable difference.

Some parameters such as defence and attack points can only be increased by trading collectable fruits (usually obtained by completing side missions) with an NPC, whereas other parameters such as ring capacity and speed can only be increased by trading Koco (the aforementioned stone creatures) with another NPC. This progression system sounds familiar enough, but the actual collecting is redundant. The game features a fishing component where each fish caught contributes some amount of tokens, which can be traded for fruit, Koco, even the vault keys used to get chaos emeralds and progress the primary storyline.

The fishing is a miserably simple quicktime affair. You throw out the line with the space bar, you wait for the bait to be taken, you hit the space bar again when the bait moves, then you hit it a 3rd time at the correct moment (illustrated by a growing circle within a ring, you must stop the growing circle so that it falls within the ring's boundaries). 3 presses of the space-bar, that's all it is, and you get a fish, a fish that can be worth (and often is) as much as 48 tokens, or enough to buy 3 chaos emerald vault keys, more than 300 Koco or 16 fruit.

So therein lies the problem, what motivates me to find anything or complete these dull side-missions when I can get all the collectables I want about two-hundred times faster with a few presses of the space bar? There's no point in me scouring the land for Koco and fruit for hours if I can spend literally just TWO minutes fishing and amass enough keys and tokens to completely finish an island.

Storyline:

It's awful, but that's nothing new. Sonic games have never been all that good at the story element. This game does go a bit further by inserting more dialogue and attempting (however poorly) to flesh out the characters, but it just doesn't work. They attempt to capitalise on callbacks to canonical events in older games, but it feels like a cheap cameo, a quick off-hand remark to induce nostalgia.

Sonic characters in previous games haven't often dwelt on anything that has occurred in other games of the series. They mostly walk around in a perpetual fugue-state, with only the subjects and topics of their current adventure ever on their mind. What happened the week before their current adventure or the week before that may as well be erased from the timeline. To see characters making cheap callbacks to other games feels off. I appreciate the attempt to give Sonic and friends some sense of continuity, but the writing of the dialogue suggests they were looking to cram in nostalgia references more so than they were looking to the past for relevant lessons or knowledge they can apply to the characters' current situation.

Conclusion:

Sega really just need to shut down for good. I like Sonic games but I'd rather the franchise die than continue to put out these half-baked clumsy games. Sonic Frontiers is the epitome of programmer-shortcuts, the prime example of what happens when a middle-manager imposes a deadline on a team of software developers without a real plan, and so the developers are left to throw together some disjointed patchwork of incomplete ideas and faulty concepts. It's a repetitive slog through levels we've seen too many times with a plot you can't care about and a totally broken progression system. My advice, don't buy this game, wait until it's 99p, or free.",,
"this game looks like a switch game even at high settings. fighting enemies and bosses feels like watching a cutscene, it looks cool but there's no depth or skill involved. the open world maps feel empty and soulless. i regret purchasing.",,

"I'm a sonic fanboy since the original sonic came out but this one was good but not good enough. It's still a good game I just wouldn't suggest people buy it until it goes down. It's not up to my standards for a triple A title.

- Combat has way to many abilities in it so it becomes a chore to remember everything and more ought that not the special attacks will mess up your natural flow of the game outside of combat.

-The game overall is fun but becomes dragged down by the switch between 2d and 3d on the fly in the open world. I felt like most of my expierences ended up in me flying off in a random direction when I was just trying to follow the flow. Some spots have this strange mechanics that stays in 3d but tries to pull off 2d and it's just horrible.

-The overall story is good so i like that it moves out of it's norms but doesn't destroy Sonic's overall personality.",,

Got this game and was very upset and requested a refund,,
"While yes, the graphics and environments are beautiful, there are a few flaws to this game that i'm about to point out.

1) It's very repetitive. 4 out of the 5 total islands are the exact same thing, collecting memory tokens and chaos emeralds for about 3-4 hours per island, with the odd classic style sonic level. It does get very boring, the segment with Big the Cat really can speed things up in terms of memory tokens.

2) Boss fight design. At the end of each island, there is a boss fight with a ""titan."" These titans are well known due to how badly the fight is actually designed. ESPECIALLY island 2. god.

3) Level design. Some parts of the game, mainly puzzles, are very complex. I had to look up a lot of tutorials just to figure out how to do it.

Now, for the best parts.

1) The story. The whole thing with the koco & the titans is amazing, really interesting. In addition, we finally see the sonic characters actually aging which is a huge plus for the whole franchise. They also got one of the IDW comic writers, Ian Flynn, to write the game.

2) Characters. Unlike Sonic Forces, this game really keeps it low in terms of characters, which is a good thing. There was no need for extra characters in this game, all it needed were the main four + Robotnik and Sage. Really well thought out.

3) Graphics. Self explanatory. Absolutely brilliant, however at one point my game started badly lagging because of the shadows. I'm not bragging, but i have a pretty good PC, so i think that's an issue.

I highly recommend this game! Honestly the only flaw is the repetition.
8/10",,
"5 years.
That is how long it has been since the last proper Sonic game. A game so bad, that it was my least favourite game of all time. After that, I was sure that Sonic was dead. the characters were horribly written, the humour was cringy, and all of the stories were absolute letdowns.
Then the teaser came out. People were sort of excited, but since it was a teaser, we needed more. then we got the gameplay trailer, and people were livid. Saying that the level design looked like it was just random assets strung together like some sort of test stage, and it just looked like a fan game in the infinity engine.
The story trailer came out, and people got hyped. They were genuinely interested in where the story was headed and they thought that the level design looks better. Then the showdown trailer came out, and people were convinced that yes, Sonic was back, baby.
Then finally, after a year of waiting, the game came out.
I thought Sonic would never be able to recover from Forces, but this game... I say, without a doubt, this is the best Sonic game, ever. It was worth the 5 year wait, it was worth Forces killing the franchise, and it was worth the $80.
Pretty much every single thing about the game is positive, although I do have 2 complaints that are more nitpicks then anything.
1. Forces and Boom are referenced, making them canon. I feel like those 2 things should be marked as non-canon. Plus it throws a wrench into my timeline that I spent the last 2 years thinking of.
2. The disappointing absence of Jun Senoue and Crush 40. They are THE band for Sonic, please just get them back Sega, I am begging you.

Overall, while I still believe that Shadow of the Colossus is the best game ever, I feel that Sonic Frontiers, is my actual favourite game of all time.
11/10. The only game that I love so much that it goes outside my rating system, something I never do. It is just that good.

I cannot wait for the mods and DLC that will inevitably come out at some point in the future.
Now please, never, under any circumstance, make us wait more than 3 years for a game ever again.

Edit: I also really like how Sonic's arm is treated like a reverse Devil Bringer, where instead of making the person stronger, it makes them weaker.

Edit 2: Got robbed at the Steam awards by CoD MW2 and GoW, both remakes of games that came out in the 2000s. This game has gotten done dirty. This is my Game of the Year.",,
Get this game! Get it!,,
"This is the best Sonic game I've ever played since SA2, it has 4 big open worlds(zones), sonic controls like a dream (except in Cyber Space), And taking down the huge bosses make me feel cool as hell! I really can't stand the pop in though, it makes trying to get the memory tokens high in the sky really difficult because I can't see where to go to get to them.

Personally I give this game a solid 8/10 it's really good but there are several things that hold it back from a 9 or 10",,
"As a Sonic fan, I am really enjoying this game. I don't think I've been having so much fun in a 3D Sonic game since Sonic Generations. It's like they built 5 large playgrounds for you to play in as sonic and it has some linear levels too. For me, it is a step in the right direction, and if they are able to expand and improve it, the next sonic installment might be even better.

It has its shortcomings though. Even though it is not a problem for me, if you are not a sonic fan (or even if you are), you might be annoyed by the constant pop-in. Also, possibly by the way they arranged things, since the rails and platforms just float there and are just metal (even though they give an explanation for that, technically speaking, some people might find it ugly). It would indeed be nicer if the platforms and everything else blended better with the terrain, but it's not taking the fun out of it for me.

Also, I didn't had any crash, stuttering, or anything else. But I'm running it on a RTX 2080, so that could be the reason.",,

"This game has some seriously cool stuff going for it. It's a major upgrade from the last Sonic game, with these wide-open areas that are a nice change from the usual 'boost to win' levels. As a die-hard Sonic fan, I was really rooting for this game. But here's the thing - it's mostly just these open zones with some rails and walls to mess around with, kind of like they're still in the testing phase. But hey, don't get me wrong, it's still fun to play. The story? Yeah, it's pretty cool, though it's missing that special something. And even though the whole barren world vibe fits the game's style, it can get a bit draining.
Btw the music is FIRE!",,
"This is not a good game unfortunately, I tried not ask for refund and tried to enjoy it for 18 hours. And I'm an old fan of Sonic.
It is not worth playing especially at this price tag (USD 30 after sale is still overpriced for what it offers).

- This game looks incomplete. The recent big update made a difference but still.
- The story is incoherent and does not make sense, why do you have to rescue friends, why can you leave an island before finishing the rescue? what is the role of the Kocos in the story and why do I need to care for their lore?
- Climbing sucks.
- How do you get back to the main menu (PC)? It's simply not possible.
- Inspired by Zelda (the world, the blood moon, the puzzles, the Koco exchange for upgrade), but feels out of the context.

Old review : This game is amazing and the world is incredibly fun to explore. Though the Cyberspace needs quite a bit more work and balancing to be as fun (Even though modders already took care of that lol).

It's actually pretty good, so far. Could be tighter here and there. I'd drop the RPG mechanics and make the combat simpler. Islands could be a bit smaller and more in line with historical art direction too but overall I'm enjoying this entry and I've been a regular hater on 3D Sonic games. It's pretty clearly the best 3D game. Oh, fix the pop in too.",,
"Easily one of the best Sonic games made
This was a HUGE contrast to Sonic Forces, is it even the same team of people? It couldn't possibly be. The amount content and the quality of that content is astounding and I never expected it from Sonic Team considering the last several entries. I didn't even pre-order because I was certain it wouldn't be good and I'm glad to say I was wrong.

The combat was insanely good! There's way more than just spam homing attack; with dodges, heavy/power attacks, and even parries and it all feels so good combined with Sonic's other abilities from Generations and Forces. Each enemy I faced I thought was a boss fight because they all have their own ""combat puzzles"" to figure out to defeat them. Combat felt similar to Breath of the Wild and Shadow of the Colossus combined and it works so damn well. Taking down big-ass kaiju robots as a little blue hedgehog really makes you feel powerful.
Many of us thought the open world would be empty and boring but its packed with stuff and really fun to just freely run anywhere as Sonic. You're constantly running into new enemies or generations/forces style platforming sections that both lead to finding collectibles and upgrades. All which allow you to make Sonic go even faster, do more damage, have more defense (so he loses less rings per hit), and hold more rings at a time (I equated this to HP in other games with it complimenting the defense stat's purpose) The RPG elements mixing with the classic Sonic game design staples is so well done and so refreshing while still feeling so uniquely Sonic.
Never in a million years did I ever think the words ""Big the Cat Fishing"" and ""it was fun"" would actually be said so close to each other, let alone in the same sentence AND in a Sonic game. But damn, it was actually fun and a fantastic super chill break-up from the rest of the game. The platforming and combat can get so palm-sweatingly intense sometimes that it's really great to have this calmer area where you can do something that still contributes to the over all game.

This is a must for any Sonic fan or anyone who wants a really good first impression to a Sonic game!",,

"The best 3D Sonic game over the last 2 decades, I'd even argue this gives the adventure games a run for their money.

Definitely a step in the right direction, the story, game-play, environments, references to previous titles. If there is a sequel in the works, I hope that the worlds are filled, for example a city to explore, not floating rails etc. Heck, I'd love Green Hill if it was open-zone and had loads of things to see and do.

Besides the minor criticisms, I can confidently say.

Sonic is back baby.",,
update 3 made this one of the better sonic games.. it was already pretty decent... imo this game always slapped and with how the updates turned out.. this game always had a good foundation... i thought it would take a whole another game for them to get it just right but damn they made this game so good lmao,,
"I'm sorry i cant take this anymore.

At launch i thought this game was alright, Later in update 2 I thought the game was Decent, and now after the ♥♥♥♥ storm that was update 3 and learning all the reasons on why the game is bad I could confidently say that this game is BAD, Like REALLY BAD.

"I was looking forward to this game ever since it was announced. I've mainly played the 2D classic Sonics, the Sonic Rush games, Sonic Unleashed, Sonic Generations, Sonic Colors (the hand-held version), and Sonic Mania. I enjoyed all of them, especially Unleashed, Generations, and Colors, and I beat them all to full completion. So when all of the gameplay trailers for Frontiers started coming out and people were getting excited, I was really expecting something great. With that, I paid full price for the game and started playing it. Now that I've beaten it to full completion on hard mode (all the achievements and even S-ranked every stage, which has no achievement tied to it), I can say with certainty that this is the first game of all time I have ever played in my life that I . This game was absolutely awful. I prefaced this whole thing with my experience with Sonic games and the fact that I beat this game to full completion so that no one can tell me that I didn't give the game a fair chance or that I just suck or something (because I can assure you that I do suck at games). Now I'm going to list just some main things I disliked (because today I learned that Steam has a character limit and I had to erase some of what I wrote).

I don't think an Open World Sonic game is a bad idea, but the way they handled it in this game was incredibly disappointing. There are a bunch of super easy mini-game challenges you can do around each island, and it's really just a handful of mini-games that are repeated over and over again across the whole game. The challenges also often have zero to do with Sonic gameplay; for example, one of them involves moving a bunch of little Tetris pieces onto a little pedestal in the correct order, and another involves stepping on some tiles in the correct order. It just felt like a compilation of little challenges that the developers threw into the game because there wasn't really anything to do otherwise (besides fighting guardians repeatedly).
As for Cyber Space, the levels feel completely incoherent. It felt kind of like those miniature special worlds in Mario games where it's just a bunch of blocks slapped together with a general theme surrounding it. I would have been fine with that if the controls weren't so terrible (as I'll discuss later). Also, there's zero real variety. Every single Cyber Space level is either Green Hill, Chemical Plant, Sky Sanctuary, or some weird highway level that I don't recognize. Cyber Space levels weren't all terrible, but the game's terrible controls, lack of real Sonic music (which I mention later in this post), and lack of variety really hurt the execution.

The combat is really boring. It's super easy, and there's really no reason to engage in combat with anybody except the guardians. The guardians themselves are often really tedious (the biggest offender that comes to mind is the Shark on Ares island). There's just so much . Some of the guardians were pretty cool, but even they lost their charm after fighting them a few times and became annoying as well. The guardians on the final island were actually pretty passable, but it still wasn't enough, especially when you can parry every attack by literally just holding the parry button. You don't have to time parries; all you have to do is hold down the buttons and you parry indefinitely—you can even hold it in midair and float in midair forever; I'm not exaggerating. What's even the point of having a parry mechanic if you can cheese it like that? I can't tell if the developers genuinely thought it was a good idea or if they were just too lazy to actually implement it but felt they needed to keep it in because it was shown in the gameplay trailers.

In terms of running, this Sonic game is the least satisfying. The boost—unless you have your rings maxed out—doesn't give you a super cool boost effect or anything. Oftentimes, I'm not even sure whether I'm boosting or not. There's also the fact that you can't hold a boost in midair. The most you can do in midair is do a short boost, and then he just goes back to normal speed.
This segues into my next major complaint, and it's possibly the worst offender: You don't maintain your momentum. If you jump in midair, you slow down almost instantly and lose of your momentum; it's bewildering and so unsatisfying. Unless you're actively boosting while on the ground, you go mind-numbingly slow, which is particularly frustrating because it means you can't jump across gaps because you slow to a near halt as soon as you become airborne.
The boosting can also hurt you; if you're grinding on rails and boost while taking a corner or while trying to switch rails, you'll very often just fly off the rails entirely (at which point, you'll often die because you're grinding above an abyss), which is a huge time-waster. Oftentimes, I even ran into a weird bug where switching rails while boosting flung Sonic in the complete opposite direction (at which point, I often die because I'm grinding above an abyss, whether I'm in the open world or in a Cyper Space stage).
Your boost also doesn't kill enemies; if you run into an enemy while boosting, you just take damage. Overall, pretty much everything that was fun about Sonic's boost has been ripped out of the game.

The controls are awful—truly abysmal. The above stuff about the boosting sort of falls under this, but pretty much everything about the way Sonic moves feels terrible. It feels like you're always having to fight the controls, and the worst part about it is trying to turn in midair. When you jump in midair and try to move in some other direction, Sonic does this weird thing where he sort of arcs around as if he's revolving around an axis at an offset. So if you're standing on a platform, jump, and try to turn backwards, instead of going backwards, he revolves and you end up falling off the side of the platform. It's hard to describe, but it's incredibly frustrating and janky, especially if you're moving faster. Maximizing the turning speed in the settings didn't help either.

Without going too into detail, the story is really boring and really weird. I seriously couldn't care less about the Koco civilization, and I was tempted to start skipping all of the cutscenes (though I didn't). The cutscenes with the other characters also just felt really awkward, especially with Knuckles. Some of the times, a cutscene will just end with Sonic and the other character staring at each other while the screen waits to fade out—it's just weird.

The user experience is just terrible. On pretty much every dialogue menu, you have to wait a second for the continuation cursor to actually appear, which is extremely annoying in some situations. It's especially aggravating when you're trying to upgrade your speed and ring capacity with one of the elder Kocos. Speaking of that, if you want to upgrade your ring capacity or speed, you have to do it One. Level. At. A. Time. You literally have to sit through his dialogue, wait for the dialogue menu to give you the option to move, select rings or speed, wait for the animation to finish, and then rinse and repeat. At one point, I got my hands on a bunch of upgrade currency from a fishing spot and decided to time how long it took to use them. I kid you not—it took TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES (or 29? I don't even remember). How does it take almost half an hour to ? Who thought this was a good idea?
There are also a bunch of context-specific cutscenes that you can't skip (like getting maximum rings playing the lightning animation every single time), which just helps kill the game's momentum.",,
"The start of something potentially great.

I love the character interactions, and the new character Sage is a treat. The gameplay is fun and addicting and mods make it even better. Sega does have some work ahead of them for the next entry. For this franchise format to continue, they need to dump Switch support which is the main culprit behind the pop in issues.",,
"So
After replaying Sonic Frontiers, I can say that the game is a whole lot better than I originally thought.
I gave it a negative review due to initial impressions not being the greatest, but really getting into the game and delving deep into its mechanics really showed how great the game was, and how much you can do in it.",,

"The DLC completely, utterly, and brutally ruins this game I had held in such high regard. From frustrating trials that bank on your experience from the new 'Extreme' difficulty, to a boss that literally was not beatable until you did one ultra specific thing and was not communicated to the player, nor used in any other part of the game, thank god this was a free update, or I would be harking for my money back. Do yourself a favor, and play the game as is on hard difficulty. Do not activate the DLC, and do not look back.",,
"In the past I said that I do find the game a bit joyless and easy. I still hold to that opinion with Final Horizon because for what it's worth I don't actually find it that challenging, just extremely buggy. There were multiple times during the game that Sonic does something completely unexpected and at times this forced me to redo entire sections. This was an issue with the base game too, but I am significantly more saddened that a DLC update that had 11 months to work out and fix some of the issues that plague this game’s movement system changed nothing about it.

Regardless, I still think this game becoming as popular as it did could be good thing overall for the Sonic franchise and I hope Frontiers' success finally gives Sega half a clue that constantly under-staffing and holding Sonic Team hostage for 20 years is not a great way to treat them, or their mascot.



I guess only time will tell.",,
"There are some slight flaws and shortcomings here and there, but for a first step in this bold new direction, I think they did more things excellently than they did fumble by a very wide margin, and I cannot wait for the next title. I hope they can expand their team so it can get the real scope that they obviously wanted for the game, a lot of my issues are purely just stemming from the fact that the game starts to lose its momentum by the end cause of time constraints, but I'm very much willing to forgive that for the rest of the experience that I got from this game.

A profoundly powerful story that gives a reasonable amount of closure to many open ended questions left over the course of the franchise's history, and seeing these characters that I've grown up with since early childhood like I have myself was a truly unique narrative experience.

I've cried more times playing this than I did playing Death Stranding and Metal Gear Solid 3 and 5.

The combat feels fun and appropriately deep enough, although I do think the skill tree should be at least twice as big as it is now, but again this is their first shot at this kind of game so I'm willing to be understanding about that.

I really like the open zones, I think how all the micro platform puzzles strewn across the zones is done rather well in terms of being able to chain/sequence break these if you have the skill to pull it off, feels very rewarding for getting the rewards of two of them for the price of going through only one of the puzzles.",,

This best thing about it is probably the story, but even then that's never exactly been sonic's strong suit.",,

PC Optimization

Poor at best, atrocious at wose. i never seen a game run better on windowed than on fullscreen. WTF... also, Fullscreen is a complete Danger to the game.

lemme give ya some examples:
Alt+Tab= Crash
Controller Disconnected = Crash
Geting the game in Windowed mode on the options menu = Crash
Using Steam's DS4 Remaper = Crash and the game does not even gets past the first Sega logo.

this is simply unnaceptable. yes, i made it work on my PC, yes it run at 60FPS, untill i decided to either do an alt+tab, or accidentally disconnecting my Gamepad. then the game just Panics and crashes completely.
it was a full chore to get this working as intended. and this is the third game ported to PC that has this issues. 3 TIMES.
this time i got a RTX2070, more than enough to run the game with ease and without problems... but WE gotta solve yours, don't we?! you know exactly the cuss wanna say right now, but the carebears here will not let me. fantastic...

for the love of god SEGA, just get a team that can actually do a good PC port... 3 companies, and ZERO success... -_- it is not that hard, even.

So my final Veredict:

(i would give 10, were not for the rushed content, overuse of default assets that are copy/pasted and the pop in of default platforms, like this was built in roblox. the assets are of high quality but it is super noticeable if you got a keen eye.)
(again, it would be higher if it got time to be polished. this game feels and probably was rushed to hell and back. it is fun, but janky as hell)
(i have only praises for the sound team. the music of this game is amazing.)
(i would give it a 10, if it wasn't for the lackluster final boss... you're kidding me that we gone from an open World Sonic game to a Nier Automata Hacking stage as the final boss,right?! WTF...)
(Get the standard version, Deluxe is simply useless for this game. Unless Sega is going to release some DLC with more story content and not only one cosmetic stuff and pre-order bonus that are consumeables i'll not even consider this.)
(The optimization is trash. for the love of god,just get a team that can actually do a good PC port... it is all that i ask)


it's a good game. but Could be much better if it was given more time to be developed. i know what Sega thinks, and i know that a 5 year dev. cycle is excruciatingly long for SEGA. but let's stop worshiping money for the love of god. let the game be finished. let the game be QA-ed. let the bugs be ironed out. give time for the game to be whole, SEGA, even if it takes 10 or 15 years of dev. cycle.
and to be perfectly honest with you i am worried if this is the direction they are going with Sonic games, like they said on their posts that this was a new era for sonic. if this era is of: pop in, dev. cycle hell, long time to finish and be pressured to be rushed and crunched, the Sonic Franchise will hit another dark era like it was in 2006 once again. and i don't want this for the series as a long time fan.

Give the game the time it deserves next time, SEGA, please.",,

"Don't get me wrong, this game is very fun but it's bogged down with numerous issues like the god awful pop in and countless denuvo related crashes. It's really frustrating getting sent back progress every 30 minutes because of a crash and sometimes you can't figure out where to go because the bits in front of you won't load.",,
"So let me get one thing straight: This game is good. Really good. I've actually been enjoying it quite a bit!

But here's the thing: I will never positively rate or recommend a game with Denuvo. In fact I went out of my way to purchase the key for this from a reseller at below half price, because if Sega's going to treat paying customers like pirates then I want them to get as little of my money for this as possible.

I'd like to hope they'll remove it eventually, though they never do. But in the spirit of fairness, if they ever do then I'll gladly change this review to positive.",,
"I find aspects of the game good but the open world part stupid you have to find out how to find gears so you can open portals that bring you to stages and then you have to complete these stages to get keys to get chaos emeralds you must unlock all chaos emeralds on each of the five islands or seven islands sorry anyways I find it very tedious and frustrating to accomplish the platforming activities in the open world part to earn the gears because if you just want the gears there's no icons or anything telling you where to find them you have to find them yourself the steam deck does not hold 30 frames on the recommended settings if you go into any any dense tree areas or areas that have lots of pipes and rings around you in the background you will dip below 30 frames making it very hard to navigate your character you have to turn shadows to low in order to almost flat line 30 frames there's also parts where the steam deck seems to decide to go into some sort of 5 to 7 frame a second lock in which case lasts for about 5 minutes or you have to restart your whole steam deck it does this after about an hour and a half of play with this application I do not recommend this game because it will very much frustrate you and make you mad I really wish they could have just made a Sonic that was 3D that has stages then a cinema then 3D stages none of the stupid open world crap unless you're going to do an open world properly and which case there's icons on the screen clearly saying that this is what this does the fact that you have to figure out all that crap by yourself makes this unfun wish I could ask for my money back I do not at all think steam should have said this game is certified for steam deck I'm actually very close to throwing my steam deck against the wall hopefully someone else reading this feels my pain so I survive steam deck seems to emulate PC games and not actually play them and the handheld is not powerful enough and by this coming 2023 summer the steam deck will not be able to play today's best game in 720p 30 frames medium to low settings I don't think so lol furthermore if you own an rtx4090 like I do you cannot play this game in 4k 120 frames because the developer seem to think it would be a great idea to cap the frame rate at 60 frames in which case Sonic would be able to run a lot ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ faster in 120 frames or 300 frames 2K none of you guys anybody out there girls will be able to benefit from your high refresh rate screens to feel the Rush of the Sonic boom the game has a lot of hints and tutorials that amount to not still telling you where you have to go it's the best Sonic game since Sonic adventure and it still sucks I think the stages are actually very fun and wish that the game was only the stages and the whole open world garbage piece of ♥♥♥♥ area was removed it would have been way better and for anybody that made it through this bubble sorry about my grammar I talked to my phone and it writes for me and it doesn't write the grammar and I don't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ give a ♥♥♥♥ about it so have a nice day and and don't forget to hail to the King baby remind you I have the rtx4090 or I could say the RTX Infinity because as soon as the RTX 5000 series comes out and the next series and the next series and the next series I will own the most powerful card of that generation and still be the king and more powerful than anybody that does not own the top tier card of the generation so yes this King his days are not numbered in fact as long as he breathes air he will upgrade his computer and he will be the king and all will bow to the green light that you wish shined in front of you in your house yes this means I own the almighty powerful rtx4090 and it means that when the next powerful card comes out I will own that card to and if you want to find me all you have to do is look up to the top of any mountain any Star any Galaxy any multiverse reality and they'll be one mother freaking man standing there staring down at you from the top sitting on his throne as king God among insects that's right and I've chosen the block comments for this one so none of you troll mangle and jabroni grammar making fun of jealous that I own a 4090 people will be able to comment and if you own a 4,090 don't forget to buy the proper power supply with the proper ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ connector cuz it actually makes a really big difference and you'll actually have a more stable overclocking experience don't believe me spend another $500 freaking dollars and find out peace",,
"In Sonic games, it is better to be fun garbage than to be wonderful and boring. This chose the latter path.

I collected the 7 Chaos Emeralds FOUR damn times. Every time you get six, you face the boss for the seventh and then rinse and repeat every single island only to lose them on the next island.

You know how you get the emeralds? By unlocking them with keys. Where did I get the keys? From completing the challenges in levels. How did I get into those levels? By random cog drops from enemies. Also, you have a couple emeralds here and there which are unlocked by getting the character emblems which are unique to each island. None of this hard work carries over between each island, so expect your excess hard work to be wasted each time. This is boring tedium.

Does it look pretty? Yeah, but it's boring. I regret this purchase. I would not have bought it even on sale. Not even 80% off would I have wasted money on this if I knew. It was seriously that boring.

Many people are comparing this game to Devil May Cry. It would be more accurate to claim they ripped off a bunch of ideas from Nier;Automata.... for what it's worth. This would not be too horrible, except this game also copies and pastes levels from other Sonic games. So much reused and stolen work.
Remember when Sonic was a very kinetic physics platformer used to show off Sega's processor speed? Remember when Sonic had it's own style and attitude that was distinct from other platformers? For a franchise entirely built on that rebellious attitude, this franchise has sold out, lost itself, and become what many oldschool customers don't want.

That being said and despite all these very serious flaws, there were some good moments. The boss fights, while extremely flawed, were interesting at least. The story, while definitely being extremely weak and not fun, had good characterization. While I hated most of the new lore added, I did enjoy the addition of the character Sage, which I think is a nice way to balance Robotnik while giving him a social anchor. This greatly enhances his character, as Robotnik's tonal dissonance with the rest of the Sonic world only works in the older 2D days, when the audience could abstract a fat human mecha mad scientist conquering in a realm of magic animal people; the upgrade to 3D and dialog made Robotnik stick out increasingly like a sore thumb, and so Sage helps give him a voice that, in all honestly, works better to explain how Robotnik can calmly spend time with cast despite trying to blow them up the scene before with a giant genocide mech. While the plot arc was dumb for most of the game, I did enjoy the whole Robotnik subplot thanks entirely to Sage. However, this was in contrast to the rest being cringe. With a few touches and narrative enhancements, this can go far. I really think they have something here that could be used to fix lore wonderfully.

Sage isn't just another animal addition, but an AI child Robotnik made and loves as his own. This allows Sage to be both friends and enemies to Sonic at the same time, which could really could be useful for writing in future games. I do hope this character is a permanent addition exactly because of what Sage brings to the table.

However, I also lament that this game's added lore elsewhere is garbage. I really hated the stuff involving these islands, the Chaos Emeralds, and honestly I think it's really bad. Worse, I think it could have been better with some refinement. The final bossfight feels like an asspull confrontation, but you only fight it on certain difficulties.

In the end though, as I said: ""In Sonic games, it is better to be fun garbage than to be wonderful and boring"". This is because of one major thing about great Sonic games: I replay them. For the record, I have replayed Sonic 1, 2, 3 & Knuckles, Adventure, Adventure 2, Mania, and Forces. I have even replayed games that were inspired by the mechanics of Sonic. However, I don't imagine myself replaying Sonic Frontier. Those I replayed had serious flaws, but regardless of those flaws, they were not boring. And that's that with Sonic Frontiers: it's boring.",,
"I AM TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED!!!!! as one of the biggest sonic fans ,.,,, i really don't like this game .... i am now fighting the first titan .... and i am already done....
this game is soooo boooring ....... Sonic and open world .... JUST DON'T!!!!!!
And what's the point of putting random rails and platforms in the sky ??? like someone build an island and nobody had any idea what to do with it .... this is ridiculous... looks like a modder made this game .... XD seriously! .... (even they made better maps, remembering the sonic unleashed mod for sonic generations?)

The only fun thing about this game are the cyberspace levels ...... and i say fun.. they are not even good!! in comparison to sonic generation levels, they look like spin-offs challange levels, you've had in generations for side quests ....

Anyway.... don't do the same mistake as i did and just crack the facka .... or wait for better price ... this is not worth it money at all! i didn't really like sonic forces but at least i wasn't forced to rage quit the game .... so much for that ....",,

"Another case of ""This didn't need to be Open World"".
The actual levels of the game are pretty good.
But the Open World is this games complete downfall. It serves literally no purpose.
It manages to dumb down the usual ""Go to tower > Unlock map markers > go to map marker"" loop even further.
It's towers are often nothing more than ""Run in a circle around this pile of leafs"" or ""stand on the glowing floor tiles"".
Even among the usual Open World busy work, this is a new low.
It's main form of collectibles are often just a matter of finding the right rail to grind on, which is just floating in mid air.
Which isn't always that easy, given this games inconsistent render distances. The pop up can be quite jarring.

Combat is equally non existent. Much of it consists of just mashing a single button, hope that the homing attack doesn't glitch out and very occasionally hold some other buttons to parry enemy attacks.
There is quite literally no depth to it whatsoever. No rhythm, no flow, nothing. Mash a button, do a QTE, hold another if the enemy is about to attack, repeat.

The game simply loves to waste your time for no reason whatsoever.
If you can stomach to finish this game, there supposedly is an ""Arcade Mode"" where you can exclusively play the actual stages and skip the open world.
Well worth to look into importing a 100% safe file for because as said, the actual stages are pretty decent.
It's just the open world that was a colossal mistake.",,

I'M FRONTIERING! AYOOOOOOOOOOOOO,,
"Pretty excellent little game! Open world traversal is fun to get around, the combat has a variety of ways to interact with most enemies (I was finding out a couple of minibosses could be cheesed with a move I never considered as late as the final island), story got a kick out of me and a few laughs, and there's never a roadblock which you can't get around in one or two ways barring ""reach this point"". Game's even a bit freeform, letting you skip around goals if you've got the requirements for them. Only time I ever ran into the game overtly cheating this fact was an invisible wall on island three.

Highly recommend and I'm real curious what the bonus DLC in 2023 is going to look like.",,

"This doesn't feel like a Sonic game. This feels like a boring Sonic parkour game where you grind your way through an uninteresting open world map that's filled with a bunch of random boosts/rings/bumpers/whatever. It's like they procedurally generated a map with Sonic items but forgot the part that makes it fun. The grinding is the only way to get to the actual Sonic game levels. The game feels so immensely slow because of it. The music is also completely unmemorable, which is sad for a series that's known for so many memorable tracks.

Just make another game like Sonic Generations. That's all that's needed.",,
"If you want more broken physics nostalgic Dreamcast Sonic on a Skyrim level with gameplay akin to Banjo-Kazooie (not rivaling) and random awkward rail loops that do nothing with pointless rings literally everywhere then hey you probably won't refund it like I did

I swear any time they get a new programmer that's like ""Hey guys, I fixed sonic, no really, the physics are great, it's smooth, it doesn't feel like trying to control a bowling ball possessed by voodoo physics."" they find some way to make that guy mysteriously disappear to go back to their cult of creating the same Adventure game over and over again to appease the 50 people still playing the series regularly who go full Gollum about changing anything at all

But here I am writing a three paragraph review on a Sonic game ffs, bottom line is there's really nothing new here for the series or the game industry as a whole, so why would you?

Oh, for what it's worth, there's a ""High Speed Sonic"" option for controls and there's the other one. So maybe the ""Non-High Speed Sonic"" controls make it fun. Lol. What the hell are they doing over there?",,

"Temporary review but I noticed these problems very early on

1. No support for Ultra widescreen
2. Meh graphics
3. Literally the only AAA game I've ever played whose graphics menu crashes the game. Yeah, if you scroll to far down, it literally just crashes the game.

My opinion might change in the future, but if these things aren't fixed for the PC port soon, I'm probably gonna refund and get the PS4 version...",,
"I cannot recommend this game on this current state at release. I was so hopeful and optimistic about this game and right off the rip I felt something was off. Cutscenes forced widescreen (with jarring black borders) at default and graphics were like we were back on a console in 2012. Not to mention the actual cutscenes themselves, story-wise, just felt so abrupt and awkward at the beginning. Gameplay in the open world is pretty good and much more fluid than Forces, but that quickly goes back when you go into any cyberspace level. Not to mention combat does not feel challenging either.

It's not a $60 game, and frankly, as a Sonic fan who grew up on the series since the early 2000s, it's bittersweet. Perhaps if I gave it more time I would get into the story and lore as I usually enjoy doing, but not with the game in this state and the price it is at. Buy it when a meaningful couple of patches are released, it's on sale, or both.",,

"People are only rating this positive because we've had such horrendous sonic games for years; the bar is really low. The same thing happened with Sonic Colors.

This game isn't very good. The level design is just big flat terrains with some rails and springs on top, the cyber space stages control horribly, and the gameplay is just BOTW-wannabe.

The game feels unfinished with horrible graphical pop-in, and a few rehashed assets from previous games for Cyberspace. Hell 3 out of the 5 worlds look identical, being just plain grassy themed. Sonic Frontiers is more like a tech demo than a super polished product. It does have moments of fun, but its a pretty weak Sonic title.

Play Spark 3 here on Steam if you want a good 3D Sonic game. This game doesn't even compare to that.
Or if you want something free, try Sonic Robo Blast 2, Sonic GT, or any of the other great fan games out there.

Don't be surprised at very high reviews on a mediocre game. These are the same people defending the game for having Denuvo and a 60 FPS lock, but Sonic frontiers is extremely mediocre AT BEST.",,

"This is almost more than a mediocre 3D Sonic installation, but I can't love it. I've been playing Sonic since I was four years old and this is apparently what passes as a good Sonic game now a days. Very saddening.

The Good:
We get Robotnik actually being nice to an associate for once and it's really refreshing to see him develop a positive relationship with a character.
Music.
Combat for like an hour.
The titans make you feel bad-ass when you're fighting them.
The bosses for the first two areas.
The fishing minigame, which is actually the best part of the game.

Bad:
The worlds feel completely empty and it's hard for me to care about the story at all when it started with zero explanation on both ends for Sonic and Robotnik.
I kind of stopped caring about bosses in area three because just by running around naturally I collected enough cogs for the cyberspaces.
Grinding for tokens in areas three and four is incredibly annoying.
Sonic feels really slow.
The leveling system makes sense for defense and strength, but leveling at Elder Koco requires you to mod the game to actually make it bearable.
There was only one real puzzle in the whole game.
Only two actually hard cyberspace stages throughout the whole game.
Combat is pointless as Sonic on foot once you get the R2 + A combo, I don't actually fight enemies anymore. I just spam one move. (Whatever the move is that causes you to jump in the air and fire x-shaped projectiles.)",,

"This game gave me Aliens: Colonial Marines Vietnam flashbacks, just by how bad it looks.

I played it for only for about 30 minutes so the only thing about the story I know is ''find the chaos emeralds, defeat these titan thingies, collect stuff to upgrade your character, and save princess Zelda
It is locked to 60fps and 16:9 and is plagued by pop-ins.
Runs stable though. This game is not worth 60$ (even the reduced price to 40$ after just a month is ridiculous for such an unpolished game)",,
"Steam Curator

Sonic Frontiers is a better proof of concept than it is a game. With glaring technical issues like pop in, non-platforming content that misses more than it hits, and a distinct lack of Sonic's signature style in the world design.... the few really amazing aspects of this game don't get to shine.

I can understand some of the early enthusiasm people have for this game; Sonic feels amazing to control in free 3D, I'm just more excited to see that format explored in a better game.",,
"I would stay away from this game no matter what the reviews may say. It's a lot of fun for the first 2 islands, but the level design of the 3rd is terrible and extremely frustrating. To get to the final boss of the 3rd island, there is this quirky pinball machine that has terrible physics but is required to pass to get to the next part. The 4th island level design is even worse, and will have you infuriated in minutes. You'll be extremely high and the separation between platforms has a tiny level of margin, meaning you'll likely fall to the bottom and will have to try over and over again; there's nothing fun about it. I stopped playing because I don't need a game stressing me out. In the end, I wasted 26 hours and $59 of my life, thank you Sega!",,
"simply put, by far the best game in the franchise.",,

"15 hours of fishing and flashy combat just barely disguising chorework between lego star wars FMV cutscenes all for unanswered questions and SEQUELBAIT. the game felt charming and fun for the majority of its playtime, especially as a sonic fan who has endured many a flopper, but by the end i was disappointed and uninvested and after the fact im a little miffed i dropped 60 bucks for maybe just over a quarter of a story told between gameplay that feels like it falls just short of what it could be and cutscenes that are absolutely not up to the same standard as multiple other gameplay related animations.

Do I recommend it? Maybe. At 60 dollars? No. If I had paid maybe 20 or 30 bucks for this I'd feel a lot more satisfied but this was double the price for a really ""Meh"" game. There is no postgame to save the bitterly unsatisfying ending and I can only hope they give it some kind of Episode Shadow equivalent to leave it off on a higher note. They should really hire a larger dev team.",,
"This feels like a student's project that they made on the side. There are huge chunks of the game without audio. The controls are god awful. The character was clearly and painfully obviously designed for the linear running straight segments, and nothing else. They then dumped that character into a student's first year level design project with zero edits. The MASSIVE handholding and insistence on tutorials every 20 yards is beyond frustrating. Camera and controls will be ripped away from you every few seconds to introduce you to yet another thing you've likely already figured out.

There *""M . A . Y . B . E""* a good game buried a few thousand miles below the issues... but I wont risk losing my refund on that gamble. This game isn't worth $60. It's worth $5 at best, and even then I'd wait for a 90% discount. The fact this has overwhelmingly positive reviews shows just how desperate the zealous fans are that they'd accept this amateur attempt at a game.

If you're absolutely dead set on throwing away $60, then at least do it as a way to gain perspective. Perspective in knowing that games can always be worse, and that Sonic will always lead the charge in finding how far down rock bottom truly is.",,
"Product refunded

I really wanted too like this game, it looked really cool, and I've had my eye on it for a while.

However there are just some big issues I can't look past.

The game is locked to 60fps which sucks when it's such a fast paced game.

It also doesn't support ultrawide monitors and also doesn't support 16:10 on the steamdeck which has been super frustrating.

The other thing that really bothered me was that there are so many gameplay interrupting popup menus and it's so annoying when all you want to do is play!

The open world was pretty bland, but there are smaller levels that are more like classic sonic and they're awesome!

Overall, I decided it wasn't worth my money and I refunded it.",,

"First thing I want to get across with this review is that this game is a fun game. I enjoyed my time with it and i'm sure you will too. However despite that i just cant recommend this game unless its on sale but for $60? I'd say pass.

This took me about 11 hours to beat and overall I had an alright time with it. that being said every positive thing about this game is also a giant flaw in some way.

- The open world is bloated with enemies, rails, springs, boost pads, etc with absolutely no secrets to discover
- The story is almost non existent with the only thing happening is sonic talking to friends
- Combat is non existent and requires no skill (which is a problem when so much of the game focuses on it
- uhmmmmmm thats literally it lol

I'm a huge fan of the sonic series and have been since I was 8 and while I think this is a step in the right direction its still... very okay.. I just feel like this was such a nothing release outside of the music. And when the music is the best part of your open world, platformer, action combat game, then you have a lot of issues that need fixing.",,

"The entire game was laughably easy, even on hard difficulty. Practically zero challenges during all Cyber Space levels, notably while attempting S Ranks, sans one single level. I continued playing despite this, hoping for a difficulty ramp --- even if slight --- but was unfortunately let down once I reached 100%. I appreciated the fact that this game takes place during the SA continuity, but the story is a far cry from both SA and SA2. Overall, if you are looking for a very casual gaming experience that will take a couple days to 100%, go for it but only if it is on sale.",,

The cutscenes in this game also feels really unnatural. Worst sonic game to come out in a while.

"Honestly, for a Sonic Game, not bad - but its more of a return to stagnation for the formula.

"It's a fun game at its core, but it's also broken. For every good idea there are a handful of bugs and glitches. It's a 7/10 - but the depths of the 3D Sonic fandom are so desperate for a ""W"" that they cannot admit that this game is middling at best. Therefore, the only appropriate score is ""Not Recommend"" to give a fair representation against their blindly-positive review brigading.",,
"I liked the game for what it was with its overall jankyness. it had some charm.

however the DLC pretty much ruined it for me. its not difficult because of quality sake but the jank now ruins the game. what was once charming is a chore because they farmed out the content to some intern while the obvious quality control team from the main game has moved on.

pretty disappointing but the DLC is free. now I know why.",,
"There's kind of a lot to unpack here. In short, I was expecting to give it a 3/10 due to previewed information, but I'll give it a 4/10 all in all. I would LOVE to take the simple approach of pros and cons, but it just isn't that simple.

Starting off with the non-spoily stuff!

The control layout is odd but does overall feel more concise and smooth than past titles in the franchise. The gameplay altogether feels like a halfway point between the day and night stages of Sonic Unleashed with some mild inclusion of Sonic Lost World's parkour mechanics. Moving around feels decent, but also mildly janky.

It's hard to determine whether or not the platforming was meant to be susceptible to shortcuts when it has other routes clearly meant to get to certain areas, especially because they don't stop you from taking shortcuts most of the time (but they do still have some preventative measures on occasion).

The fighting gets very button-mashy. It's a good reminder that the game is first and foremost meant for kids. The game expects the player to spend lots of time rotating the camera, and it doesn't help that the lock-on feature isn't especially consistent. There's also a parrying feature which can be rewarding to use, but only when it wants to be effective. It does require the player to stop in place after any other actions' animations have ended, so it feels like an additional task on its own despite being incredibly simple to actually use.

All in all, the feel and concepts of the gameplay are cute, simple, mostly satisfying, but quite janky. By a wide margin, it's the best thing about the game. Wouldn't say it feels as good as Sonic Unleashed or the Adventure titles, but it isn't TOO far behind.

There are some additional tasks pretending to be minigames that really aren't necessary. They're not just unamusing, they're work. There's a crane machine, a pinball machine, a Galaga knockoff, several puzzles too simple to be difficult that throw a wrench in your efforts to make it stupid.. Every second not spent either exploring or fighting is just extra work for the sake of extra work, and since some of it has no clear indication of success, you can expect to be confused and staggered to the point of restarting that extra work.

""Cyber space"" stages are also work. They're slow, forceful, ugly, and have the worst part of the OST. It's ACTUALLY a downgrade to the stages in Sonic Forces!

One of the weirdest downsides to the game is its obnoxious love for compressed cutscenes. Get 400 rings? 720p cutscene. Parry an attack during a boss fight? 720p cutscene. Walk up to certain mini-bosses, 720p cutscene. Forget to pause when you go to answer the door? No joke, 720p cutscene.

Put nicely, the OST is dynamic. At its best, it's snooze music, and at worst, it's a good reason to mute BGM. Accompanying the hub worlds (which occupy roughly 90% of your playtime) are mellow, sadness-focused tracks. Because yeah, that's why Sonic's smiling and moving at a high speed on a sunny day in the game's promo artwork. Unfortunately, that's the best aspect of the soundtrack. The ""cyber space"" stages feature the same misery brought forth in Sonic Forces. It's like listening to a cat slowly pander around on a synthesizer. To top it off, some boss fights in the game feature a specific song that's an entirely mixed bag and does not fit in with the rest of the soundtrack in any way, save only the terrible voicing and weightless, over-dramatic lyrics. When those voices do shut up, the song is actually invigorating, and it does a fantastic job of setting a tone for the fight. The half-assing is truly unfortunate.

I've found it best to play the game borderless with a media player and three playlists ready: something that feels adventurous, mild, and upbeat (like the Sonic Runners OST or just general soundtracks from past games) for the hub worlds, something with a bit more energy (perhaps past main game OSTs like Sonic Adventure 2 or Shadow the Hedgehog) for the digital dimension stages, and, really, for the tone they wanted and didn't have the balls to aim for, get yourself a DOOM Eternal playlist for those Super Sonic boss fights.

What surprised me the most about the game is that the crew that's been voicing the characters since 2010 did a decent job of keeping the voices organic, and the way the characters are written in absolutely helps the flow of every situation with very few exceptions. I was expecting the voices to absolutely flop on their own and fail twice as hard with some over-dramatic writing (which, really, the previewed OST seemed to confirm), but no, almost none of that at all.

Speaking of writing, the story is pretty engaging half of the time, and that's another area I was expecting it to fall incredibly short.

_


The voices and writing that are hardest to appreciate are Eggman and the virtual emololi, ""Sage"". Talk about dramatic naming. She's pretty much a passive, docile rework of Sonic Forces' ""infinite"" (because, yeah, we needed more of that horse $#!+). She's ultimately there to doubt Sonic for the sake of building him up as a magnificent character while everyone else just kinda behaves normally. It feels much like the total fustercluck of a story Halo: Infinite has where the not-Cortana AI (who turns out to be ""good Cortana"") is just there to make Master Chief sound like some kind of unstoppable force, and you can't help but wince and force yourself not to skip scenes.

Eggman does not help. In the atrociously bad excuses for storytelling we've gotten post-2009, Eggman was the one character that really didn't see or need any changes. His anger can and has always shifted between immediate frustration, cute comedy, and actual menace. Here? He's never angry. He's mildly grumpy twice and otherwise grossly content and tame.

The story is perhaps the most dynamic aspect of the game in terms of quality. On one hand, there's absolutely none of that wince-inducing ""sense of humor"" we've been force-fed since 2010. The concepts explored throughout the game often relate to information in past games in the franchise. On top of that, the more you find out, the more answers you want.

The storytelling does have two unfortunate catches, however, and most of it is at the end (which matches the sudden drop in gameplay and soundtrack quality). Eggman starts to talk like Sage is his daughter, which comes from the hell out of nowhere, and Sage decides to call him her father.

The end credits give you some ""I love my dad"" song, by the way. That's what the game was about all along.

The final boss fight has two phases in the higher difficulty: the weakest, jankiest, most inconsistent Super Sonic fight in the game (of four), and then a ten-minute Galaga hardmode stage. The ""true final boss"" has about as much personality as a blank sheet of paper blown around on a street in the middle of nowhere. It's called ""the end."" That's it. That's the name. I'd go on about it, but it's just such a flat, stupid, half-assed item. It's like they put a ton of effort into the majority of the game and ran out of steam on finale development day or something.
_

Again, all in all, 4/10. It's kinda decent to play, and it's nice to see some of the characters actually act and sound like characters for the first time in forever, but the bad soundtrack, additional tasks that aren't fun, disappointing shortage of answers, janky and mildly buggy gameplay, disgusting ending, and absence of replayability are very taxing.

Par for Sonic titles in the last decade - save Mania, of course - I'm never going to play this for more than twenty minutes a year in the future. I seldom meet people as stubborn as I am, but this game serves as the final nail in the coffin for my 28-year run as a Sonic fan. It's been too embarrassing for too long, and the fact that people act like it's Sonic's ""long-awaited triumphant return"" is utterly humiliating.",,
"You can collect little guys to redeem for Rings or Speed upgrades. Problem is that each one has a max of 99 upgrades and Sonic Team really thought it would be funny to grant a level up one at a time... An alternative would be to have a redeemable points be value for the player to allocate all at once.

Sonic Team hasn't figured out have to make a configurable game engine. Whole objects (textures too of course..) will pop-in within something like 5 meter. Insane, especially for a platformer.

Fishing minigame is just as tedious, I walked in without 30 fishing coins and it takes about 20+ seconds to go through one round of the most mindless fishing game I've played. Getting those lore pages from fishing will take so much of your time..

There's an exceedingly amount of Sonic jank this time around, comparable to Sonic 06 or Adventure.

Rail hopping animations don't have a nice follow through animation and end abruptly. If you hop off a rail Sonic will glide through the air an an invisible rail lmao.

Setting Bounce Height to max and full boosting off terrain will showcase some physics on the same level as a middle schooler's Unity project. Terrain collision jank and other unrefined physics will still occur with lower settings.

The later two of five islands reuse stuff from the first one. 4th island is just a 20 minute linear repaste of the first. 5th island uses a new map with the same biome theme. So when Sega mentioned there would be five huge islands to explore they actually meant three! LMAO

It doesn't help that you can see the 4th outside the invisible walls during your time on the 1st. Nor does it help that the image files for the 4th and 5th list them as ""World 1"" just like the 1st.

So yes, yet another Sonic game is blatantly rushed.

One more gripe...

If the maps were more like Mario Odyssey sure, with platforming integrated into the terrain. Or even all downtown cities could've worked better too

Frontiers maps are a bunch of landscapes with random rails and platforms jarringly thrown in. Not even with any lore explanation.

All in all.... it's still fun.






Floating rails and platforms
- On-rails
- Forced camera
- Forced 2D
- Token collecting I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about doing for the literal 500th time and I'd rather just afk macro loop farm

Ouranos Island literally upped the grind by 100x like there was a paywall I had to overcome.

Maps I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about
- Three maps pretty much have the same theme
Kronos and Rhea are literally the same map. Ouranos is split from them. 3/5 islands are the same

Cyberspace levels have different physics
- Drifting levels aren't even built correctly accounting to Sonic's physics

It's a crime that S Rank 1-2 was the only challenge (and enjoyable) one to get

Downgraded graphics so that the game could run on Switch
- Aggressive pop-in on all platform

Fishing mini-game grindier than F2P gachas
- 32*4=128 runs of mind-numbingly slow fishing to 100% it all, noooo thanks!

Level ups one at a time and Lv99 for each upgrade
- Grindy like a F2P gacha

Jank as ♥♥♥♥ boss battles besides the final one

Jank as ♥♥♥♥ terrain climbing and physics interactions

Sleeper story
- Forced game references
- Forced loss of Chaos emeralds every island
- Only meat is the beginning and towards the end
- ^ I literally don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about each of the three ghost characters' sad feelings about the Chao history


*Overall unpolished*
Music and most of the CyberSpace levels are the only real merit

^ Unleashed (all of it) and Generations were better. This game reeks of piss poor management and rushed development more than Forces",,

"So after half a year or so I though I try to play this game again and sadly I still see a broken Sonic game.

For example the open map.. why!? It feels so weard running around in a map with weard placed objects or flying rails to walk/ slide on. You would think you can decide where to run for example I wanna go through a desert cave from point A to point B with allot of speed and cool tricks but then the game places jump and boost pats in your was that just tell you naaaa you cant go this way try it the other way from point B to point A :> Like why?! it kills the fun mood in my optinion.
(dont get me started on the map itself)

The Problem is the older Sonic Games go in one direction but thats not really possible in a open world normaly. But I guess they didnt get that?

All in all for me it feels like a Sonic game doesnt really fit well together with a open world the designing looks awful it feels like sh+t running around withe weard physics and the enemys are boring to fight against.",,

"Bad voice acting, poorly programmed, needs a lot of polishing. The animations are not good and inconsistent. The jumping animation feels sluggish. When you press dodge, there is a significant delay as opposed to other buttons, and it's not a frame rate issue. This game is just poor quality. In the mini training/tutorial missions, it doesn't even check if your attacks land; it just waits for you to press the buttons displayed and it registers as a success.

Too many buttons, sometimes the levels jar you because they want to be 2d but aren't.

Feels like sonic. Plenty of lore. Bad guys seem like new age traditions.

Only been playing the game for 44 minutes at the moment. Had to wait til I had a controller to really get into it, a bit of remapping for my thumbs are broken and I can't keep pressing Trigger buttons to do specialties.

"This will probably be one of the only negative reviews you see for this game. Unfortunately this is game shoots for the stars and doesn't stick the landing.

Story: The story in this game is okay. It gets the job done and there are some good moments but the animation of the characters in the cutscenes are so robotic that it takes away from any emotion shown. What could've been great opportunities to flesh out some of the characters, are just filled with boring exposition (most of the time). The main story quests they give you as well suck balls, almost always being some lame minigame you have to play which makes you care so much less about the story.

Gameplay: This ones' a bit of a mixed bag for me. First let me just say there is NO FREE ROAM SUPER SONIC. That is one of my biggest upsets because you're given this world to run around in and I can't even go super sonic outside boss fights. I love running around and high speeds but the boost in this game is abysmal compared to the old boost games like generations. The boost is limp and slow and it feels awful to use. Not only the boost, but the homing attack has a long animation delay between each hit making it feel terrible to do. This is why I've opted to use a mod to improve the physics of Sonic for the last bit of my playthrough and it is wayyy better. Sonic without the mod handles okay. It really depends on preference I feel like as you can tune him how you want him to control. The combat is fun at times but becomes a spam fest (although cool looking) when you're trying to kill the same copy paste boss the 10th time. The biggest and most egregious sin for me in this game are the cyber stages. Easily the most uninspired, boring, terrible Sonic stages in the whole history of the game. They're copy and paste, the way Sonic handles in them is terrible, and they're just boring.

The Open World: Meh. It's fun running around in it but you do the same exact challenges on almost every island to unlock portions on your map so you can see what else lies there like AC style. Not really that many enemies to fight which is unfortunate. Not really much incentive to explore then to get some Kocos which control how many rings you hold or how fast you go and these little powerup fruits that control your defense and attack. No secrets or anything like that which sucks. They really could've done something great with the open world.

Graphics: The game looks okay. Looks like it could run on last gen hardware, severe pop in, and capped framerate on pc unfortunately. Was excited to run this game in 144hz but I don't have the option.

Soundtrack: One of the best OST of any Sonic game. This ♥♥♥♥ was straight fire from start to finish.

Conclusion: Despite my gripes, I still think this game is a great foundation for something AMAZING. I think this should be the way they make future sonic games but they just need to refine the game more. Nail the stages so they're fun and memorable, improve Sonics handling, craft a better story, mature sonic, make the open-world worth exploring aside from powerups, allow you to go super sonic in the open world, really modernize the franchise. I wanna see something that's ambitious, fun, and has passion. This game has the building blocks for those things they just need to double down.",,
"Sonic Frontiers is a fantastic addition to the Sonic franchise. The game's music and vast landscapes blend together seamlessly, creating an immersive experience that truly captures the spirit of the series. The original characters are a welcome addition, and hearing classic Sonic music brought back fond memories of playing the old games as a child.

While the game is excellent, it does feel a bit short. I'm looking forward to the next installment of Sonic Frontiers, and I hope the developers will add more content to make the game even longer and more engaging. Overall, I highly recommend Sonic Frontiers to any fan of the franchise or anyone looking for a fun, nostalgic gaming experience",,
"This game is actually unironically pretty good. There are some issues with certain aspects of the gameplay, especially regarding combat though, and I also think some of the overworld map design is non intuitive in its layout making it so you have to take really roundabout ways to get to certain points, but all around the game feels great to play, controlling Sonic is just fun.
I’d say that the controls and feel to everything is strangely Adventures-esque, I really get the same feeling playing this as I did running around looking for secrets in the overworlds of Sonic adventures as a little kid. There’s just something about how the physics work and how Sonic’s momentum feels idk, could just be me lol.
All in all this game actually makes me hopeful for the future of Sonic as a franchise, and I really hope to see a game that takes all of the good aspects of this game and perfects them.

I would say that basically every single cyberspace level being green hill zone is a bad thing but the cyberspace levels are such a minor part of the game that it’s more amusing to me. It’s like they’re taking the piss and trolling everyone, taking the “green hill has to be in every sonic game” thing to its most ridiculous extreme.",,

"i played this game since its release, unlocked everything, dabbled in the dlc, and got all the achievements. i do not like this game. honestly, nothing about it is really that fun. the terrain is all land no loops, corkscrew pipes or any of the interesting design older sonic games had. i really wanted to like this game, but as time goes on this game ages poorly. when this game came out i rated it a 6/10, a mediocre but ok game, now i rate it as a 5/10.

the writing in this game is such a hit or miss. amy is just nothing now with no characterization and for some reason is just ""one of the guys,"" which is dumb. knuckles was alright, and tails was just annoying. its funny, with how the dialogue tried to fix these characters, it honestly made them worse than they were previously. the story was somewhat interesting but seemed to have dipped in quality throughout the game. the music was pretty good with a few bad songs here and there but overall decent. combat was just really bad. none of the moves make much sense for sonic, he isnt goku, hes just a fast character, they shouldve utilized his speed more with moves that surround it and made use of his agility.

i could go on a long rant about every issue this game has like it being really unpolished, pop-ins everywhere, and the fact the game looks worse than forces??? like how is that even possible? if you want to play a good sonic game then check out sonic unleashed as its by far the greatest sonic game made. sonic adventure is pretty good and generations is a good collection of his past levels. that is all.",,
so skibidi sigma with a grimace shake on the side,,
this game crashes every 2 secondss refund it if u bought it,,
"I don't get how this game got anything close to a positive reception, almost nothing in this feels right.

Sonic controls like complete crap he feels like he's megnatized, he stick to the ground like glue and just kinda zips to random targets when you attack something even if it's not on screen. The boost is a complete jankfest, it's on a trigger by default which is fine if it didn't have zero deadzone so the slightest squeeze makes sonic rocket off into a random direction. You can also boost in mid air (except for when you can't) which gives you some more height (except for when it doesn't) but it doesn't combo into a ground boost (except for when it does.) If you haven't noticed yet the boost is inconsistent in how it functions which is pretty annoying since it's your main method of doing the fast.

Combat is completely braindead, it's mostly just mash attack you do have some special combos but they're pretty much always worse than just mashing attack and some special attacks are actually a detriment to you like the homing shot; The homing shot is activated by attacking after an air dash so if you used an air dash as a gap closer you're now stuck in a 3 second animation watching sonic throw some balls doing ♥♥♥♥ all damage while destroying any distance you closed to the enemy in question and this isn't even the only example, in general you're better off just sticking to the right upgrade path as those are mapped to the ground pound.

The main areas are also mostly complete crap. The first one is fine enough if a tad uninspired, the second has some excessive pop in like I had several occasions where I was running down a corridor only for a wall to spawn in my face levels of pop in. The third area for some reason is obsessed with 2D sections in the 3D overworld which is not only disorienting but since these micro challanges are all over the place it's common to accidentally step in one and be forced to faff about for half a minute in 2D mode and hope the end doesn't spit you off in the opposite direction. The fourth area is a bunch of tower climbs most of which are mindless and one of which was so bad I nearly dropped the game then and there. And the fith and final area is once again fine enough if a tad uninspired if it wasn't for the random grindwall where you have to collect over 150 collectables to continue.

There are also small more traditional Sonic levels scattered around the islands with the exception of the 4th one, these levels are derived of older games which means that a good 30% of them are green hill zone. Overall these are fine but you do have to complete a couple of challanges to collect keys that you use to collect chaos emeralds (there's a lot of collecting in this game.) These challenges aren't anything too special but it does mean that you have to repeat each mission a couple of times which tend to expose how barebones most of them are.

The bosses are the best part of the game, these things go HARD. they're not difficult at all but they make you feel like a complete badass and the music just sells everything so well, the final boss however sucked. Just like the other bosses it's really easy but it doesn't do anything special, it has some weird crystal laser thingies circling it but those are more of an annoyance than anything else. The music wasn't even that good either but what's really insulting is what happens when you beat it; (spoilers for the finaly if you still care) You get a cutscene where it's revealed that the boss you've been fighting was just a possessed robot and the real baddie is reforming in space, eggman sends his AI daughter into space with you to fight it, the big baddie's real body turns out to be a moon and AI girl sacrifices herself to blow it up. This is all done in a cutscene after which you get unskippable credits.
Edit: I read some other reviews and one of them mentioned the final boss was a bullet hell so I looked it up on youtube, turns out theres a second part to the final boss but for some reason it fails to spawn in my game and I frankly don't care enough to troubleshoot this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ so take from that what you will.
Edit 2: As a commenter pointed out the real final boss is locked behind hard mode, I'm not gonna play it any more because I simply can't be arsed to but I feel I should at least bring it up.

I could sit here all day complaining about everything I dislike about this game so I'm just gonna lay my funniest issue here. You get to upgrade Sonic's stats in this game, two of the stats you get to upgrade is his speed and his max ring carry capacity, the issue is that there's a mechanic called ring boost if you collect the maximum amount of rings Sonic's speed is set to what it would be at max level. So leveling your speed means that ring boost will have less of an effect and leveling ring capacity means that achieving ring boost is harder, two stats that directly goes against a main mechanic, you can't make this ♥♥♥♥ up.

TL;DR this game is an absolute mess, I had fun in the first one or two hours but looking back that was mostly because I hadn't noticed just how terribly designed it really is.",,

I do not want to grind through worlds in order to unlock the classic ""cyberspace"" sonic levels.

Does that mean I am not ""hardcore""? Probably. However, Sonic should be just fun and not require an investment of effort. Sometimes I sort of felt lost and directionless in the worlds and frustrated that I would need to defeat some other boss etc. in order to unlock the next classic Sonic level.

The ONLY way to unlock Arcade mode is to BEAT THE ENTIRE GAME.

"Sonic Frontiers may be improved in the Final Horizon update but there is still quite a lot of things I want to complain about. The main problem being that it is almost impossible to S-rank certain cyberspace levels! take 1-2 for example; 55 seconds to S-rank and it feels like the level is naturally a minute long, and 5 seconds faster is a massive pain in the back. Not to mention the controls; Q and E to parry? trying to navigate my fingers to the 2 buttons when I've focused a lot of my brainpower into the movement, boost, stomp and jump buttons. another problem that I'd like to point out is that the animation in non-cutscene conversations with other characters seem rather unfinished; movements of the head are too linear, there isn't enough facial animation unless the characters have a separate animation for it, I think i recall seeing Tails turn around without actually moving his legs (but I still don't know if i saw that right). Most of the gameplay, The story and graphics for Sonic Frontiers are good, don't get me wrong, but I think that there's still work that needs to be done. (god, I wish there was a sideways thumbs-up for steam reviews)",,
"The game definitely isn't bad. However it is unplayable.

I play plenty of other games with better graphics without even a slight issue but this game CONSTANTLY freezes when you enter any of the portals no matter what graphics settings you have set. The portals are essential to the game because you need to do them to get keys. When I watch Task Manager, I can see that when the game freezes, the CPU jumps from like 40% to 100% and then jumps back down. It's clearly not optimized to run on a PC properly.

It's sad because I actually really enjoy the gameplay but let down by the fact I can't play the game properly.",,

"A sonic game where momentum is more random than the fishing.

I was hype for this game but upon playing it, I immediately realized that I was in for a frustrating time. To start off, for some reason the game defaults to settings that limit your momentum so attempting certain maneuvers slow you down too much or just halt you completely. You can select preset setting to emphasize either Action Style or High Speed, I chose high speed but noticed that if I hit a boost pad and let go of my stick I almost immediate come to a halt. There is also a setting that was switched on that slows you down when you jump, so attempting to jump with any type of boost slows you down so you would miss a jump and land in a canyon or a stream of lava. Another thing I notice is that the drop dash has an issue on 2D stages. It works fine on a flat surface but if there's any incline you will lose all of your momentum or stop completely. It replaces the spin dash (which is unlockable) but I assume it would have the same issue of losing momentum on anything but a flat plain.

A couple of the enemies were fun to fight but overall most were boring at best and tedious at worst. Some of the mini bosses that were tedious to handle were the Tank, the Fortress, and the Squid. The Tank would have you watch a cutscene every time it would bring you into the air and the floating attacks that you would have to do felt like trash to land, some of my attacks would put me through the Fortress and I would fall to the floor and have to redo the entire fight, and reaching the Squid took forever even with voltage speed. Sometimes after you're done attacking some of them during their vulnerable state, you would be left so far behind that it would take an entire minute or two just to catch back up to the point where they would start attacking you again. The main bosses also fall into the boring or tedious categories. The Giganto and The End have to be the most boring boss fights in the entire game. Giganto pretty much has you spamming your attack button while The End forces you into a bullet hell in which you can't do any damage for about 2 minutes before the sequence ends. During some of the boss fights I even ran into glitches that would force me to restart the whole fight such as necessary platforms not spawning in or sonic jumping backwards on rails.

All of the levels that are unique to Frontiers are horrible but the stages that were blatantly ripped from previous games were pretty fun such as level 2-6 which is a reskin of Sky Rail from Sonic Adventure 2 and 1-2 which is literally just Sky Sanctuary from Sonic Generations. The unique levels had no other ways to play them and were extremely straight forward which made them boring and forgettable. There was no thought put into the maps and no exploration needed to get an S rank or to collect the Red Rings. The overworld islands were also all boring past Ares Island. Whoever designed the process of unveiling the map really needs to be fired. You will do a small challenge and the map will be exposed in small, random blotches rather than a radius around the challenge point. The towers on Rhea island had me scratching myself due to their height and awful platforming.

A small issue I have is that this version of sonic is really boring. I don't expect him to be all quips all the time, but there are many moments where Sonic and a lot of the other characters will just stay silent or smile at one another and it's just awkward dead air. Sonic also barely says anything during gameplay, sometimes he'll chuckle or stop by some ruins and comment on it but overall he just feel like a playable character here to move the story along rather than a fun character to be around like he's supposed to be.

The final thing I'll talk about is the fact that you can literally use Big The Cat to cheese your way through all of your upgrades. I went to a fishing spot for about 30 minutes and spent all of my tokens on Koco Children or upgrade seeds and got my speed/coin capacity to max level and my defense/attack to around level 60 or 70. I'm glad I didn't do all the grinding for speed levels because level 99 speed is just voltage speed. So reaching max rings just gets you to level 99 speed anyways. I also purchased most of the memory tokens from Big since I couldn't be bothered to play the game any more than I had to in order to complete the story. Another thing about the fishing is that it's on a set pattern rather than random pulls. Through my 30 minutes of fishing I went through the cycle about 2 or 3 times and noticed that all of the catches would repeat in the same order.

TL;DR the game has momentum issues, boring or tedious enemies, easy access to max out all upgrades, many glitches that will have you restart boss fights, and sonic feels off.



i came back to this review multiple times to edit in things i forgot about",,
"Gameplay is VERY clunky. Getting hit makes you lose all control for almost a full second but without, so it's possible to get knocked down then get killed before you regain control. If you jump while running it resets your speed and you have to accelerate up again. The platforming and camera are tedious and frustrating. Just all around a lousy experience with very clunky gameplay. The challenge feels like fighting against broken or under-designed game mechanics rather than anything intended by the devs.

Would not recommend unless you love Sonic enough to be willing to play through a bad game that isn't fun just for the story, but I'd recommend you let someone else suffer and watch an LP in that case.",,
"everything after the 2nd boss was boring and repetetive, the ACTUAL gameplay/movement is great feels great havent had a single bug, but being a sonic adventure fan this was kinda garbage i havent wasted money on sonic games since SA2B and honestly best part of those games were the chao garden but even without it deffinitely better story and game feel, this game felt like a big tech demo and the last 2 islands felt lazy or rushed, wyvern was best boss fight (2nd out of 4 or 5 if u even count The End) and The End was so anticlimactic.. took 28 hours to beat and do all side story stuff... worth about 30 bucks, maybe 40.

Gameplay feel was best for a sonic game ive seen yet

Boss fights were epic and had slappin songs that were synced to the phases (except the crappy 5th boss/cutscene if not on hard

story was meh

open world and puzzles and WAY too short mini levels were just bad. i mean the 4th island was LITERALLY just the northern half of the 1st island and the last one was also... green grass and trees like island 1 and 4.. is was rly like 3 islands while saying its 5.. so disappointing after 3rd island and you realize the next island is bs and AGAIN when u get to the clone last island...

Feels like a test game with some story thrown on top sloppily. gameplay mechanics are down i just want to see some good story and a chao garden i mean... chao garden amiright?",,

"You get open world, wanna run through it on bashing speed?
Sike!
Every 3 minutes something stops you from running. ""Take a look at this, try this skill, read that piece of lore, look at optional location, look at this, stop at that""
It's a game about speed or waiting? Ffs",,
"finally. a good sonic game, i really enjoy my time with this game.
this is of course not a flawless game, by island 3 the open zone design feels lazy,
i really despise any and all 2d sections in this open world like game.
alot of people say cyberspace is the worst part of the game, i could not disagree more, i like this quite a bit, they are fun short and a nice break from open zone.
the mini bosses across the islands vary from pretty decent to the most boring and un fun part of the game.
combat is decently fun and unlocking the skilltree is great.
music is absolutly great. i love all the tracks.
as saltydkdan said ""this is like if breath of the wild had ADHD"" there so much stuff to do and you can get so easily distracted with the small puzzles and everythinng around the map

uhrhrgh goo game!",,
"As a long time and avid Sonic Fan I have to give this a thumbs down. It's very janky in controls, and it's just awkward.. I like the direction and I enjoyed the little time I did have but I just can't recommend it. Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Generations had such smooth and great controls, and with Frontiers it's just.. not happening. ""Awh yeah! This isn't happening!"" The story is interesting, but no CGI intro? So many cutscenes and it's all just.. bland. Even when talking to the Koko guy there's no chat boxes or dialogue it's just text popping up on your screen. This review is definitely subject to change when the price goes down and things are getting fixed.

I hope that maybe in patches and whatnot they can smooth out the gameplay, but for now I'm refunding because this definitely was not worth $59.99 asking price.",,

awesome open world game,,
"After Spending 20 hours to 100% all the islands and really take in what this game has to offer as a sonic title the short review is 3.5 out of 5 stars. It is an ok sonic game, if you are looking for a nostalgia kick from sonic adventures 1 & 2 don't buy this game. if you want a mediocre brainless sonic title this is for you.
NEGATIVES:
Bad voice acting & dialog between characters feels stiff
choppy cut scene except for major ones
janky movement / interactions with world environments
lifeless islands seemed to me they were an after thought
story is generic and played out
finale boss is the easiest with no reward for 100% i.e special 2nd faze (yes I know about the hard mode space invaders, it was week as far as climatic battles go in a sonic title.
rendering just pop's in objects whenever you get close enough to them
many reused assets just tweaked for other islands. ( there was some variation that was good but not enough, made the encounters felt more like a chore then fun at times. )
HAVING TO RE-CLICK LV UP SPEED & COINS 99 TIMES EACH FOR A TOTAL OF 198 TIMES!!! like who sits there and thinks this is good game design! Put in a slider ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.
no control of sonic's spin dash move nor can we wined one up like we could in every other sonic game
If you power lv and do to much damage to quick the game will struggle to keep up and some times wont place damage onto enemies ( this happened to me twice fighting the Titans. )

POSITIVES:
combat system / New moves introduced
Digital worlds were a lot of fun some more then others but over all good.
THE MUSIC HITS HARD IN THIS GAME!
Parkouring around the open world island is fun
verticality not seen very often in a sonic game.
Fishing Mini Game

Final Thoughts:
There are pieces to this game that are really good and a lot that could have been done way better. Is the animation, graphics and voice acting acceptable for a video games in 2022? Absolutely not, dose this add something good to the sonic franchise as a whole...... well kinda, I think they really hit the mark with combat and music but i feel like the formula is missing something that made past sonic games better. I commend them for taking on the challenge of an open world sonic game. It gives me hope that they found a direction for sonic from this, because the concept really can be amazing for this game, but here I think it falls just short of being what I believe we all hoped it would be. Is it the best thing since sliced bread for sonic? No, but it's an ok game that hopefully taught the sonic team some lessens, so they can take what was learned from this game and make something even better in the future that meets all of our expectations for the sonic game we all want to play.",,

i love sonic but the graphics look like they came outta 2012! that was kind of a deal breaker for me, 60 bucks and the game doesnt look good. i honestly feel like a story mode game should have a lot better graphics than it does, even more so because we are in 2022!!!",,
"gameplay:
addicting, fast asf boi, high replayability. however enemies in the open world felt too repetitive.

story:
empty and bland. out of place dialogues. so many annoying unskippable cutscenes. the pre-rendered cutscenes looks worse than ps2 game cutscenes. imagine shaking character models like ffx cutscenes. it's so weird how in game graphics looks tons better than the pre-rendered cutscenes.

price:
not worth it, for the price of AAA game, the quality is AA most.",,

"It's a fun game alright, not Breath Of The Wild-levels of amazing. But it's fun.

Three things that kinda take this game down a couple of levels are:
- a lack of basic QOL game design decisions
(examples being, no way to level up several times, not having to wait 5 seconds per level up, minimap not remembering your filter option on re-opening, max ring cap animation playing each and every time (which btw, once you hit 999 rings, is a pain to even get max rings to go fast), all little things that playtesters should have noticed didn't feel right)
- the insane amount of pop-in. Sometimes it's just awful.
You see an object in the distance you wanna collect, but no clue how to get on that lone platfor;, and after running around for 5 minutes a rail pops in next to it... meaning the awnser was obvious, but just not popped in yet. It ruins alot of sections
- The Cyberspace levels feel like a mix of Colors + Forces gameplay. It has automated segments, but isnt THAT bad. They are honestly just... boring mostly, about 20% of those stages are actually fun, and well.... to remain spoiler free: Green hill Zone and Chemical plant zone are once again.... re-used

The game is hella fun, the combo's feel nice, and the ""final-zone"" boss battles are amazing. It's a visually nice game too, and the gameplay flows well, with very little loading or waiting inbetween.
Just a shame it didn't have more time in the oven to fix up on those little QOL things, the pop-in. And perhaps they should have just reduced the Cyberspace stages down from 7 to only 2 or 3 but made them more interesting like SA or Heroes level design. More routes, and not over in 1 minute

Just my opinion
Buy the game, if you get addicted, keep it going, if you don't, refund

(Oh and story is a MUCH better improvement, IDW-comic readers will LOVE this)",,
to much lag,,
unfinished pile of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ don't buy,,
"Sonic Frontiers gates off progression behind a *pinball minigame* where you have to score 5 million points and get the ball out the top of the board. Your multiplier resets with each lost ball, and yes, there are pits where you just lose the ball and you can do nothing about it if it goes there.

There are no special Sonic game gimmicks to it. Not even bumping the game to influence the ball. It's just plain pinball.

I cannot recommend this game until they patch in a skip function for this because having to win at *pinball* to *progress* is honestly stupid. Putting Puyo Puyo into Sonic Mania was already bad enough, but this is horrid. It has nothing to do with the rest of the game beyond 'lmao Sonic has a pinball game and pinball levels so let's do pinball' and even misses how you *are* the ball in those and have far greater control than you'd even have in real pinball.

Just.

♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ *pinball.* Really?

Edit: Oh, and the final boss in hard mode is galaga mini game you don't even play as Sonic in. There's no reason to play hard mode, it doesn't even give any extra cutscenes, you just get to hear a thing monologue while you shoot at it for like ten minutes and it'll only die when it's done talking no matter what you do.",,
"Spoiler Free: Next to nothing in this review is about the story because the gameplay and quality itself has pushed me away to waiting for a sale. It took me just 40 minutes to realize that this game isn't worth $60.

Anyways Sonic Team if you want to make this game $60. Then I'm going to review it to the minimum standards a $60 game should have.

This game doesn't deserve the praise its getting. It just proves that Sonic Team still can't make a game without pandering to nostalgia. The first level is literally yet again GREEN HILL ZONE. The bar has dropped so low for Sonic Fans that they have accepted this as ""Sonic's Mario Odyssey"".
I gave this game a chance and bought it, but I refunded right after the 3rd CyberSpace stage because of how horrible Sonic controls in 2D. If Sonic Team is going to put 2D in the 3D Sonic games atleast make him control good. Not to mention how bland those stages are. I've already played them in past Sonic games.
This game ""supposedly"" took 6 years to make, but the lack of Quality in it makes it seem like a year was spent on this game. You can really tell with the Pop in that happens with this game. I see other arguments stating other open world games have pop in. They don't to this extent no way near how bad it is in this game. It's not even an issue with how fast Sonic is going. Just look at how fast you're going in SpiderMan do you see things popping in literally 5 ft away from you? I was walking as slow as possible and the platform just popped in right next to me. The graphics aren't even good enough to warrant pop in The only issue is poor game development.
The animations, combat, and how Sonic controls feel sloppy and thrown together. Not to mention from what I've seen his rail grinding, and sidestep are ripped straight from Forces. You can't honestly expect me to praise this game when they can't even do the bare minimum to make it look like they cared.
I also really did not like the voice acting in this game. No hate to any of the voice cast, but their voices sound like they were forced just to make the story sound more serious. Roger's voice just does sound that well like this in my opinion. On a side note why are still making the story about Sonic going through his past stages. Sonic generations already did this 11 years ago, and they did it way better than anything they will do today so why are they still trying to bring his past into new games. GIVE US SOMETHING NEW!!!!
The ""open zone"" thing is possibly the ugliest open world I've ever seen in a video game no joke. It has random springs, platforms, balloons, rails just thrown in for no rhyme or reason. This is the one time I'll ever say that the fans can do it better, because they have. There is no excuse for this bad of level design for this big of a company in 2022.
I just want to play a good Sonic game with the standard quality that they should at least try to hit in video games. I'm tired of putting faith in this company just to be let down every time they release anything. I'm not buying this game again until it gets the price it deserves. This is exactly what happened with Pokemon Sword/Shield. People were bashing the game hard then some idiot started the #ThankYouGameFreak trend and gave them the green light that what they were doing was right. No bad reviews is gonna change Sega now, because the fans absolutely LOVE this game just cause its open world. They gave Sega the green light to go. Sonic Frontiers sequel is going to have the same issues and poor island design with rehased old levels. I could honestly go on for a lot longer but I doubt anyone is gonna see this/ care about my opinion of the game. Sonic Fans are so blind to this games quality that nothing I say will matter.

I absolutely cannot wait for RadicalSoda to review this game. His reaction to seeing Greenhill zone again as the first level is going to be golden.",,

The last thing I want to say is that you don't have to take my word for this, since this is my opinion and all. You can get the game and form you're own opinion. If you don't like it, refund it, I guess. I think that overall this game is good, but has some flaws. However, you should still get it if you are considering it. This game isn't perfect. but its positives outweigh the negatives. UPDATE TO THIS REVIEW: when i saw the dlc for this, i tried to play immediately. waited a LONG time on downloading the dlc, and then my game kept crashing. wanna know why? i had mods installed from years ago. also, even after i fixed that, i still dont know how to play the dlc. maybe if i can figure it out ill update here and add a review on the dlc to this too",,

"They actually managed to make a good 3D Sonic game after Generations. W H A T

Gameplay can be a little jank at times but a majority of it is fun open world Sonic that handles the best he ever has since Adventure 1.

Story is also a treat, if this is your first Sonic game its decent... BUT
If you have kept up to speed (please laugh) with Sonic's past games back to even the classics, there is a lot here for you to love. Ian Flynn helping out on Frontiers REALLY helped the characters personalities grow, pretty much on par with the Adventure games.

Overall, extremely solid 8/10 for me. Game kinda falls off at the end and the Pop in and Graphics need work, but everything else EASILY makes up for it.

My final thoughts so far is a recommended. The game does have some of jank with certain mechanics+physics, some questionable design choices, and an anticlimactic ending. I still enjoyed my time with this game as for me the pros outweigh the cons.

The game has some really good characterization; something we have been wanting for a while now. I was a fan of the direction of the music from the vocal rock tracks, to the varied EDM tracks that accompanied the Cyberspace tracks; I was even pleasantly surprised about the choice of using lofi music for the fishing minigame!",,
"TL;DR
Don't pay for this while it has Denuvo.
This is the best 3D sonic game released in some time, but feels lackluster in almost every way except most of the open world segments. The ""cyberspace"" stages are god awful after the first map, and the game has a chance to crash your entire computer at every loading screen, which happened to me 7 times so far. It probably has something to do with Denuvo. Protip: disable the ""training stages"" to reduce the number of loading screens.

I think young children might really enjoy this game for what it is, but I don't think a mature adult can get too much enjoyment out of this. But lets be real, if you love Sonic, you were going to buy it anyway.

Sonic Frontiers is SEGA's first earnest attempt at making a truly modern open world game ""with the sonic formula"". You go around each map slowly collecting odds and ends to further the story. You can unlock upgrades for combat and for... speed. Honestly the open world part of the game is probably the best part, with a few exceptions.

The story is more serious than most of Sonic's ""serious"" outings, but nowhere near as serious as say ""Sonic getting impaled through the chest by a demon Sonic"". It's still asking for too much, but I can't say the story is bad.



Even on the faster difficulty, you will still be slow. Getting about 15 speed upgrades will put you at an optimal speed for exploring. Other than that, the changes made to the controls, both in the button layout, and certain mechanical changes like your boost giving you some height, really make exploring enjoyable.



Sonic finally looks good in a mostly non cartoony style world that doesn't clash. I think this is at least notable for Sonic. It looks good... when you aren't moving.

Because of certain factors, Big's fishing mini game salvaged the last 40% or so of my playthrough. You can skip all of the cyberspace levels, and the tedious rail grinding/combat grinding for the knickknacks your friends want before they will talk to you.

The mini game itself is a little bland/easy, but the fish look good and the music is great.

This is likely related to Denuvo. Every time you enter a loading screen, you have the chance your game is going to crash. This game crashed after the first cutscene for me. It also crashed durring a cutscene attack for a boss. And I don't mean the game crashing, I mean crashing your entire system.

Protip: The training mode ""loading screens"" still require you to load after they are finished loading. Skip that trash and turn them off; it loads faster too.

I'll go into detail in other negatives, but there is something wrong with the controls when not in the open world. Delayed inputs, missing inputs, broken physics, and extremely late buffering of button presses are pervasive in just about every control scheme you get.

Imagine Sonic Generations stages copied, remixed and then shortened. Now add terrible controls. These are supposed to be bite size stages that you try over and over again for keys. They are so awful that when I figured out you could get keys using Big's fishing mini game, If you thought those stages looked cool, my advice would be to just buy Sonic Generations.

Both the 2D and 3D segments have strange control problems, and the physics/controls are not the same between the 3D stages and the Open World. As far as I am aware, none of your upgrades matter in those stages. I could be wrong, but I stopped doing them and stopped buying speed upgrades at 15. Going above 15 speed levels makes the open world areas not very fun.

Thankfully, even if you don't want to play the fishing mini game, you don't have to play every level on each map.

I'm tired of getting half assed, horrid 2D segments in modern 3D titles because:

""Sonic used to be 2d"" - Some SEGA executive high on pain thinners.

These are the worst, whether you are in the open world, or you are in a god awful cyberspace stage. Once you are in 2D mode, you cannot escape. Going too fast breaks the scripted physics and will cause you to go out of bounds as you move on the Z axis. The 3rd island is littered with two minute long 2D rail grinding segments that take place high in the air. If the scripting breaks, because you happen to be moving to fast, everything will shift to 3D and you need to start all over again.



Knowing this, it should be no surprise to you that I stopped playing them. What a waste of time.

Every. Time. You. Want. To. Move.


The. Selector. In. A. Menu. It. Takes. Two. Seconds. Before. You. Can. Move.



This game in motion looks pretty bad. I have a fairly modern computer, but that doesn't stop assets popping in as I approach them; full level geometry, enemies, npc's etc. Even though I have the blur filter turned off in the settings, it's blurry when I boost. Bloom only having a ""low"" setting is annoying as well. No matter what I tried, every cutscene had screen taring, the rest of the game had none. Most of the cutscenes are just two people doing canned animations and talking at each other with very little movement, so I'm not seeing why it's like this.

I am genuinely convinced that because the game has diegetic ""glitching"" that SEGA thought they could get away with real graphical glitches because ""how would they be able to tell?"". True or not, the game looks pretty bad when you move.

Bigger enemies have a gimmick to them that requires more than just attacking. Fine. Having to grind on a rail for 2 minutes before I can even start hitting the boss, and I have to do it 2-3 times? Huge waste of time. You don't need to even fight mini bosses if you just play the fishing mini game. Regular enemies sometimes have boss drops as well.

Sonic gets a skill where, if you draw a circle, you get stuff; Rings usually, but also exp, atk/def tokens, and knickknacks. You can draw circles repeatedly, anywhere, over and over again until you have everything maxed out.

You better believe I abused this when I found out, as it takes less time, and is more enjoyable, than grinding rails for two minutes.



There is so much more, but we're talking about a Sonic game, so why keep going? I think this game will be a generation's ""Sonic Adventure"". A game that can be a lot of fun, has a lot of good moments, but is flawed enough that people will say it ""aged poorly"" in the future (even though it was already flawed for its time). It's not the worst sonic game I've played, but it's not good enough for its $60 price tag.

I would be happy if SEGA would iterate on this game and make something great, but it doesn't matter how much better a sequel to this game could be if given enough time and effort. SEGA will throw all of this hard work away, and make another 3 abominations in the next 5 years. NEON Sonic Genesis: Revengencevangelion will be lamented as another Sonic game with wasted potential.

Buy this if you want to think about what ""could be"". Otherwise, don't pay more than $30.",,
"This is by far the least ""Sonic"" Sonic game ever.

1. Controls: The game simply doesn't play well as a PC Port. Inputs can sometimes be eaten and other times the game will queue up a follow-up action if you accidentally click twice in rapid succession. I -STRONGLY- recommend buying this for console if you have one (And even then I would suggest a different game first).
Also for some reason there are 3D portions of the sub-levels where Sonic just... doesn't go with the flow of the level? The level will go left or right, and Sonic will just... not. He'll end up running into a wall. In Sonic Generations things like this didn't happen, and are hard to navigate on a keyboard. If this is something fixed with a controller, it should've not gotten oversight for a PC Port.

2. Gameplay: This game tries too hard to be too many other games at once. It has elements of Breath of the Wild, Shadow of the Colossus, Dragonball: Fighter Z, Bleach (Anime), Fishing SIM World: Pro Tour, a random Beyblade reference(?), and 1080 Snowboarding. It definitely has the ""Gotta Go Fast!"" aspect that Sonic is known for. The problem is that in the overworld, you don't know WHERE to go fast. The map is only filled in by completing random side-quests that involve (most of the time) NOT going fast. These include hitting balls through hoops by hitting them from different angles, completing Legend of Zelda style tile floor puzzles where too much speed and you'll likely mess up and have to restart, and... jumping rope for 20 seconds without messing up... There's a Sonic Spinball style puzzle as well but it's a generic pinball game that takes too long to complete and in no way feels rewarding.

The next gameplay issue is the lack of level variance. At the time of making this I've only completed about 25% of the total game (60% of 3 zones out of 5). In those 3 zones, I've ran into at least 4 variations of Green Hill Zone and 3 of Cloud Temple. There are a couple others, however I found it strange that I'd run into that many of the same levels with as much of the game I had left to explore.

One EXTREMELY painful part of this game (And devs if you ever read this, I cannot stress this enough) is the forcing of 2D platforming in the 3D overworld. HOLY GODS this is the most annoying thing imaginable. Picture this: You're Sonic, going fast. As you're Mach 3'ing all over the overworld you stumble across a random speed pad that you didn't notice. Hope you weren't planning on going that direction, because NOW you're headed the opposite direction in a 2D space and you cannot force your way out of it until completing the section, 600 meters the wrong way from your destination, unless you fall to your death or lose all your rings and die (which both only sometimes work). You can definitely press W or S to try and go 3D, but invisible walls will keep you on the set 2D path until you're done with it. Why anyone thought this was a good idea is beyond me.

Let's talk about something cool now to break things up! Something unique that Sonic Frontiers brings to the table is the creation of new routes in the overworld after completing the mini games. After completing all of them, you can easily traverse whichever zone you're in with relative ease. As an OG Sonic player I thoroughly enjoyed the idea of seeing new paths opening up as I progressed through the game.

Ok, enough of that, back to more issues. This game has cutscenes. Most of them skippable! What a time to be alive! One cutscene that ISN'T skippable is the ""Sonic has gotten his max amount of rings and can now go SUPER FAST with the boost button"" cutscene. While it's only 5-7 seconds, the amount of times it happens in the game is excessive. At various points in the game you can choose to upgrade your max rings and I haven't thought of a decent reason to other than ""Now I won't see this cutscene as often"" and that's kinda silly.

Speaking of upgrades! Sonic now has... stats? You can collect various items from slain enemies (which usually means you've gotta stop going fast to 180 and collect them since they don't auto-collect like they should) to upgrade Sonic's Attack and Defense Stats! After fighting 3 bosses and various ""elite"" enemies in multiple zones I still have no idea what the defense stat does. It doesn't seem to slow the amount of rings you lose when in base Sonic form, and provided the bosses have super easy-to-dodge damage mechanics I'm unsure of whether ring depletion in Super Sonic form is affected. The attack stat is nice, provided bosses have healthbars now! *Confused Hooray*? No longer is the game 'hit the boss 8 times to defeat it,' but do more damage by collecting the resources and completing fights in less cycles. Speedrunners are gonna have a hayday with this. You can also increase Sonic's speed, which is super nice! If... you get really good at dodging those 2D speed traps that ruin your overworld fun.

For the record, I'm not opposed to 2D levels. They were an amazing throwback in Sonic: Generations and they were absolutely lovely to experience again. However Frontiers refused to capitalize on that by instead creating clunky versions of 2D space in their 3D levels. Many sections simply don't feel like they fit well with the speed at which you are going in the 3D space when transferred to the 2D portions and vice versa. It's almost disorienting the first couple times it happens and then just morphs into an annoyance.

This next part might just be my age creeping into it, so I'll try to be as objective as I can. I'm 34 years old. I've been playing sonic games since the age of 5 and the whole ""This game is all about FAST"" was very alluring to me. When Sonic got his little *BZZT* of damage by pressing the jump button a second time in Sonic 3/Sonic & Knuckles, I thought THIS IS AWESOME HE CAN DO DAMAGE AND NOT HAVE TO POSITION DIRECTLY ON TOP OF THE ENEMY NEATO! But now... There's combos? There's Mortal Kombat/Fighter Z style attacks? Sonic shooting energy waves out of his hands like an energy blast attack? Really? Is it cool to see happen? Yeah, I guess. It just feels weird that it's SONIC performing these attacks. Sonic had always been the game about fast, be the FAST! ROLLIN' AROUND AT THE SPEED OF SOUND! But the convoluted amount of extra STUFF packed into the game just makes it feel less like Sonic and more like a clone of other games.",,

This actually sets a weird precedent, where the game settings state they support a specific setting, but the game itself does not reflect the setting stated.

"TLDR; A mediocre bloated tech demo with next to no new or interesting ideas.
Sonic Frontiers isn't a bad game, but it certainly isn't a good one. You will see everything this game has to offer in its first couple of hours. It's a shame too, because sonic controls relatively well (For the most part) but is inhibited by the game's lack of creativity in using it, and inconsistencies being the open world and cyberspace. The open world is a joke, your locales are: generic green plain, empty desert, and mountain. All lifeless, empty and somehow railroaded? The world is not fun to navigate at all. You will be strapped into a forced side scrolling section if you even accidentally run into a dash pad. You will be forced into a mini boss intro cutscene and have your camera locked on to it even if you don't want to fight it and this is all within the open world. The cyberspace levels, which are your missions, are based on sonic's memories blah blah blah, and are just an excuse to reuse the the same levels we've been in for more than a DECADE. This game has little to no identity. Also the stuff that you've been upgrading in the open world doesn't apply here. In fact you run way slower, and you have a completely different control scheme in these levels, its odd that they do that but they keep your open world homing attack which has absolutely no momentum after hitting an enemy. There's a complete dissonance here. The game definitely takes inspiration from Sonic Unleashed, however where that game succeeded in its cinematic flair and arguably better combat, it's a stilted mess here. Combat so simple a baby wouldn't have a problem with it. To paint it, imagine having an automatic parry by holding a button, I just described every boss fight. I was also laughing at every single boss because of how awfully animated it was with the terrible music in the background. It's baffling that a 2008 game beats out a game that came out in 2022, a game in its OWN SERIES. I don't care much about story but it felt really phoned in here. I like the callbacks and acknowledgements to past games but everyone sounded bored, or it was the voice director fault. Even the climax felt empty, after beating the true final boss, I went ""That's it?"" And I feel like that's the best way I can also describe Sonic Frontiers.

Edit: Admittedly the music did kinda grow on me a bit after, game still sucks tho",,

"I like Sonic Frontiers, its the best 3D Sonic game in a while, and there are others who can break it down better than me. What I do not like however is the occult, something Sonic usually does not have. However this game brought back Amy Rose's hobby of reading tarot cards and incorporating them into her playable abilities. I do not like tarot cards, (I think her character was just fine without them, and they don't really add much for how much focus they get) so I am posting this review as a warning to anyone else sensitive about the occult.",,

New Game+ Extreme Review
Final Horizon Expansion

Sonic Frontiers is a pleasant surprise!
Despite its poor initial marketing, the game actually turned out to be good. Really good.
Most critics says it's good, fellow players say they liked the game, and I myself have very much enjoyed with it so far.
Now I'm not saying that the game is fantastic of course but I do believe this game puts the series on the right direction that it so desperately needs after the mediocrity that was Sonic Forces, Sonic Lost World and pretty much how the franchise was handled in the past decade.

You're on an island and you have to collect things to progress the story and level up your stats by doing the many activities that the world offers ranging from platforming, doing obstacle courses, solving puzzles, fighting minibosses, playing traditional-style stages and even fishing.
That's pretty much the gameplay loop and it's actually quite fun to do as you explore the world with fast traversal.

As long as you select ""High Speed Style"" when starting the game, Sonic feels good to control as his movement is tight and flexible which makes navigating across the world fun as you do it so swiftly.
It's also possible to use momentum to make big jumps from ramp-like structures or from rails while boosting.
The only thing I don't like about the controls though is that there's no deceleration as Sonic will just stop on a dime once you let go of the analog stick (or movement keys) which does indeed feel off.
Please, do not pick ""Action Style"" when starting the game because it'll make Sonic disgustingly slow and even the gravity becomes heavy which makes airtime feel not as good.
Thankfully, you can readjust the gameplay settings in the middle of the game.

This time around, combat has become more elaborated as Sonic needs to do more than simply doing homing attacks on enemies. Your initial fighting ability is button-mashy but you'll be able to spice it up with button combos by unlocking new abilities from the skill tree, because of course you do these days.
Once Sonic is equipped with these new abilities, the combat can actually be fun to do, especially on tougher enemies and minibosses where doing a variety of attacks in a single combo can be quite satisfying.
I should also mention that you can dodge and parry attacks as well, the latter of which is quite generous as you don't need to precisely time it right to counterattack your enemies.

Oh and once you finally get to face off against a major boss, the game hits you hard with songs that are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lit and you become Super Sonic which makes the encounter feel awesome as you utilise all your fighting abilities that have gotten even more powerful. Sonic feels like a badass during these moments which is something I deeply miss after so long.

I won't speak so much of this, especially since I've yet to finish the game and I don't want you to be spoiled of course, but if you're a fan of Sonic games from the 2000's and you don't like the Saturday Morning style of writing in 2010's games, then you'll most likely going to enjoy the story of this game, how the characters are portrayed and the continuity nods to the lore that's been established in Sonic games prior to 2010 where since then, the interesting lore was pretty much ignored.

Okay, this might not be a big deal but there are people like myself that highly appreciates this sort of thing where there's a sense of connection between the games with the background of the Sonic universe feeling rich with fascinating details.
It's what I loved about the series where, aside from the gameplay, the games' universe used to be quite imaginative and I hope Sega would continue to focus and expand upon it as lore can make games real interesting.

Ian Flynn, the writer of this game who also wrote the Sonic comics that are said to be really good, is a blessing to the Sonic franchise and I highly encourage Sega / Sonic Team to keep him along as he understands the characters and the world well.

While I do believe this is the best 3D Sonic game in recent years (though that's probably not saying much), it's not without its flaws unfortunately and I wish Sonic Team would improve upon them for their next Sonic game.

While Starfall Islands can look beautiful at times, it's still not a very exciting place to explore when previous Sonic games had exotic locations with unique landscapes. I get that it fits with the somber context of the game but it still hurts it as people are put off with how it looks like an Unreal template project and wouldn't give the game a chance because of that.

It also doesn't help that the game is full of floating platforms and rails that don't look thematic enough with the environment when the world could've been designed full of landmarks with platforms and railings actually integrated with the environment.

While this game doesn't suffer major technical issues like Sonic Colours Ultimate and Sonic Origins, this game does have this glaring pop-in which can be really annoying for those who are sensitive to it.
Personally, I don't find it distracting enough to hinder my experience but it definitely needs to be fixed.

Lastly, the Cyber Space stages could've been better with more than 4 themes and elaborated level layouts that aren't simplified versions of existing levels from previous Sonic games.
I get they're meant to be remixes but I rather see new original level designs.
Also, I'm really sick of seeing Green Hill and Chemical Plant being reused and I wish Sega / Sonic Team would stop revisiting them so much. We're tired of the nostalgia pandering, please stop.
I don't care if they're meant to represent Sonic memories because obviously, that's just a lousy excuse to reuse them.

I know non-Sonic fans might think this game isn't great but I truly have a good time with it and it surprises me that Sonic Team actually developed a competently-made game that is at least decent after years of games that are arguably duds.
This is indeed the right direction for the Sonic series, it's on the right track with an enjoyable gameplay formula, promising writing and of course, a well-crafted soundtrack even though the latter is already usually great with Sonic games.
Seriously, this game is a good one as the majority of fans will enjoy it and I'm sure reasonable non-fans would too if they're willing to check it out with an open-mind.

This has been mostly a great year for Sonic as it started out with a second movie that is better than the first one whilst exploding the franchise's popularity even further, the first four classic games have been made more accessible thanks to Sonic Origins (even though it's not the definitive way to play them as it has some problems), and Sonic Frontiers came out to be good in the end as the general consensus who played it agrees it is despite its awkward marketing.
The future is looking pretty bright for the blue hedgehog if Sega keeps the momentum up.",,
"if someone were to ask me what I think the worst game i've ever played was i'd so easily say sonic frontiers. words can't even explain how bad this game is i'd generously give it a 1/10. before you even buy the game you're hit with a $60 price tag, which is a reasonable price for top of the line games.. not whatever this is. if you do decide to buy it than the first thing you'll be greeted with is a AWFUL ui. the ui is horrible and as i'm looking through these settings there's no option to uncap framerate. i didn't think that'd be a problem until i loaded in and i'm greeted with horrible gameplay and cutscenes. the map is vague and dry and some would even say lifeless, ontop of the bad map you'd think that you're sonic you're fast.. NOPE. i'm quite literally moving like a slug. than back to the framerate part the cutscenes are capped at 30 FPS. I bought this game on PC not a nintendo switch why are cutscenes capped at 30 frames. the game itself is capped at 60 which i wouldn't have a problem with if the graphics were good. the cutscenes look horrible and choppy, the gameplay is bad and all over the place, some of the worst voice acting i've ever heard, and overall its just a repetitve ""collect everything"" open world game. the game has little to no direction and god awful plot i've skipped every cutscene because it looks horrible and i cant take the voices seriously. you'd think a company (SEGA) worth $3B would be able to produce a top of the line game, this game is no better than a indie game with a 10K budget. also to add onto the absurd price tag if you payed $10 extra you'd get nothing out of it besides a hole in your pocket.

just a overall bad game that doesn't have a single redeeming trait in my opinion. you're just exploring a bunch of lifeless maps with tedious quests that make no sense and are completely boring. if you want a good sonic game buy sonic unleashed, sonic generations, or sonic colors. don't ever buy this game. only buy this game if it's on sale for like $5. i really tried to understand the hype behind this game but i just don't see it at all. this game is going down as the worst game i've ever played",,
"It's for 8-10 year olds or people who just want easy wins. Every level can be cleared with 3 out of 4 keys on the first try, and getting the 4th isn't hard. The battles are point and click, absolutely no skill needed. The cycloop allows you to get infinite rings, not that there's any need to max out your rings unless you just feel like it, you won't max them out in any levels just the main map anyway. Unlocking the chaos gems is as easy as blinking. I would rate this game 2/10, and the 2 is only because it's pretty.",,

Also port unleashed to pc for the love of god",,
"This game sucks. Don't buy it. It tries to be Death Stranding and Breath of the Wild, but the camera is trash, as usual. Not worth $60. I should have waited for it to be $20.

I'm playing on Steam Deck, btw. For anyone that is wondering if it works. It does for the most part, just bottom out the settings and you'll get a consistent 30-45 FPS. I'm using the 720p resolution. It's not perfect, but it's far from Unplayable as Steam claims. The framerate does bottom out to 0 every now and again, but it doesn't impact the gameplay too much and they are very infrequent.

I put 9 more hours into the game and got to the 3rd island, but it's still pretty awful. The camera ruins this game. Sometimes in the 3D overworld, the game will lock you in a 2D perspective which is incredibly annoying. There are annoying puzzles that don't give you any hints. I just had an encounter where I had to destroy 4 towers in a time limit. Oh, that reminds me, why does everything have to have a time limit?! Everything about this game is stuck in the late 90's and early 00's from the story, to the cameras to the over the top anime stuff. Anyway, back to my point, the tower fight turns into a puzzle because they want you to figure out how to kill the towers. Then there are herding levels where the things you are herding drop bombs. The one in the 2nd level, when the bombs explode it turns the entire screen black and makes it impossible to see.

This game is just bad idea to bad idea. The worst part is that they play tested this game and they were like ""Yup, this is a 10/10 game. GOTY contender!"" How delusional they had to be to come to that conclusion.

The only saving grace is that I enjoyed the first island's exploration and just wandering around the game world collecting things, but even that became a chore because they give you WAY more collectables than you would ever need. I had 300 hearts before I ever saw Amy for the first time, and I barely even needed half that amount to complete the first area.

I really don't know why I keep playing this game. I'll probably just shelf it when the next game comes down the pike.",,
"If you thought Zelda BoTW was the pinnacle of gaming, you'll probably love this.

What I got was a shallow, open world collectathon that massively wastes time. I got bored after an hour wandering around in some dreary, rainy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ not knowing where to go. I killed a few bosses, did a few challenges, collected the things they dropped.

But to get to the next area, wait! You need to collect more of the things. Where exactly? We won't tell you, just wander around wasting more time doing stuff until we decide you can progress.

Again, if you love this gameplay loop, go for it. I personally find it super boring and regret the purchase.",,

This game is a pure boring collect-a-thon with forced camera angles when you random hit certain things a piss poor pop in engine limitation that everyone has sweeped under the rug in reviews.

the boss music is pure emo metal by kellin quinn which has no place in a sonic game. (where is crush 40 that should have had its rightful place here????)

the cyber space levels, the classic style stages while great are level grabs from previous games. one of them is litterly rail cannon from SA2 with a green hill/emerald hill skin and all the great control from the open zone area's (when you have free camera control) is gone away to awful controls that take you off ledges way too often.

going to get all the achievements as it is a sonic game but its no where near the second coming every sonic fan seems to think it is. there's a reason that mania, made by fans has been the best game for years.

The reviews are carried by the memes, explains why the reviews are so positive.

It's extremely annoying to start collectables/events just to be interrupted CONSTANTLY by other overlapping events & patrolling bosses, the controls are janky and send you flying from time to time, homing attack goes through airborne bosses resetting the fight, several times softlocking on deathscreens, the empty world is apparantly according to lore some curse of loneliness that looms the island but it just comes off as some lame excuse to do lazy work.

"Extremely not worth 80 dollars. The game - mechanics and story - are not worth anywhere near that much.

"Before this game came out I considered it an insult to game designers as a whole, with glaring issues that simply looked embarassing for developers. But even after post-release feeling disgust towards this game I ended up giving it a try.

I have NO clue how they even handled the marketing, because the game is more polished than 90% of triple A titles right now. Most issues felt like they were balance-wise more than anything. On a Sonic game. Can you even believe it? After countless entries a Sonic game that is polished, well thought out and well made.

It's actually a shame this game didn't make it to the Game Awards (as rigged and boring as they are), because this game excels at many of the aspects they tend to bring out in games.

The music?
10/10 easily, I'm not that big into rock but even I can enjoy a well composed song, and this game does that and even more: the synths are unreal, probably my favorite in any game period, and I've played so many games you wouldn't believe it.

Graphics?
They looked absolute ass even on launch trailers, but as of November 2022? Areas of the game I thought for sure would look horrible look gorgeous the third and last island have some beautiful scenery (I'm being serious about the third, you'd need to play it to see it), and while the pop-in is vomit-inducing, I feel like that was something that Sonic Team tried their best to improve. It's a shame it looks as bad as it does on launch, but hopefully post-launch they'll improve it.

Sound design is top tier for Sonic game standards, what more can I say. Voice acting? Great, love the new Knuckles voice actor, I've gotten used to him pretty quickly.

Overall, this game might be on top 3 best Sonic games, near Adventure 1 and Unleashed.

One last thing I'd like to mention: It's not major, probably half of people didn't realize this, so I wouldn't really consider this even a spoiler but... This game is so obviously setting up Adventure 3. If you haven't played it yet you should definitively see for yourself the actions of all the characters and their motives while the story evolves, huge potential for a follow-up.

So yeah, don't watch any videos, don't look up any trailers, they show the worst side of the game... I don't even know how. Go play it yourself.",,
"Product received for free

The fact that this is so highly rated by the community, as of writing this, is less about this game being good, and more about other 3D sonic games being bad.

This is what I call a ""motor oil game."" In the James Bond movie, Quantum of Solace, Bond strands a bad guy in a desert with nothing but a canteen of motor oil. Bond bets that the guy will make it about 20 miles before he considers drinking the motor oil. Later on we find that guy dead, and with motor oil in his stomach. The moral of the story is that when you're dying of thirst you'll drink anything.

Sonic Frontiers is a canteen of motor oil in a desert.

There have been so few good Sonic 3D games. Many of the ones that are good just show promise for something in the future. That promise is almost never realized. I thought Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2 were good first steps. Now those games are considered the bar. They're terrible. Anyone who likes that game as an adult is because of nostalgia. No rational person picks up Sonic Adventure 2 for the first time as an adult and says ""Man, the Knuckles segments... I live for those."" However, since the 2D Sonic games are so good, I'm always rooting for Sonic to find his footing in 3D. I personally thought that Colors and Generations were steps towards something really good, but that really good thing never materialized. Given that history, I can't give Frontiers a pass as a good step forward because I doubt it will mean anything in the future.

In many ways, Frontiers shows a lot of promise. In the open world, Sonic feels generally good to control. The problem is that the open world is bland and repetitive. Never mind the fact that the hovering rails are an aesthetic blunder, the actual game play on those aerial monstrosities is essentially the same thing over and over. What you do in each map is so boring as well. Find Macguffin, Find keys, do mini games, find more keys, find more macguffins, and kill boss to move on to the next island. It is so monotonous.

And then there are the traditional sonic stages you may be familiar with. I personally don't mind stuff like Green Hill and Chemical Plant getting recycled over and over. I do mind that these stages feel awful because Sonic feels awful to control in these segments. Better versions of this are available in Sonic Colors and Sonic Generations.

What really plagues the experience regardless of whether you're in the open world or not is the absolutely awful camera. Often the Camera tries to frame what's cool in the moment, not what's useful for the player. It leads to this element of instanced trial and error. In other words, you'll get used to how the game works and feel pretty good about your mastery of the controls, but suddenly a camera change completely upends your muscle memory. It's like getting slapped in the face by a cold wet fish. Not something you deal with often, but you'll likely scream WTF when it happens.

The saving grace of every map is the boss at the end, and even that could be better. They are plagued with quick-time events that look cool, but become boring after a while. Until the final boss on hard mode. To be fair, it is hard mode, so the final boss should be hard. It isn't that its hard that I have a problem with. The problem is that I stop playing Sonic and start playing Ikaruga, apparently. Instead of a Sonic game ending with sonic fighting a boss, it ends with a top down bullet hell with a space ship. I mean, if you like bullet hell games, I'm sure you'll love it. I hate them, and to have to deal with one after everything I mentioned did nothing to improve my opinion of the game.

Overall, if you're a Sonic fan who is looking for something better than Sonic 06, Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic and the Black Knight, Sonic Forces, Sonic Lost World, Sonic Unleashed, Sonic and The Secret Rings, Sonic Heroes, Sonic Boom, Sonic Adventure, or Sonic Adventure 2. Then you're set with Sonic Frontiers.

However, if you're looking for a good game, this ain't it. Try something like Sonic Mania, instead.",,

i need to beat this game,,

I have autism",,
"this is coming from somebody who has beaten both the base game and update 3 on both hard and extreme difficulties:

sonic frontiers is a game with a ton of great ideas yet none of them are realised to their full potential, and yet they still came together in a way where i can say i had a lot of fun with it.

- the world is fun to traverse, but the art direction is wildly inconsistent
- the combat is kinda neat, but it lacks serious depth and the infinite parry makes it a joke
- the cyberspace levels aren't that bad once you get used to them, but the reused assets and level designs are lame
- the character interactions are great, but the story falls apart by the end (update 3 mostly fixes this)
- the boss fights are spectacular and some of the coolest moments in sonic, but all the cool moments happen in cutscenes/quick time events
- this game has heart and soul and i can tell sonic team wanted to make something great, but the game still ended up being rushed towards the end (moreso a sega problem than a sonic team one)
- the soundtrack is undisputed fantastic though, no counterpoint here, its excellent all round

the updates have done nothing but make the game better overall, even if the final trial in update 3 is genuinely unfun levels of difficult (seriously do NOT play this update on extreme i'm just mentally ill), the rest of the update was a fun challenge in my opinon. the spin dash snaps the game in half but it makes the game way more fun to play. kudos to sonic team for listening to feedback amongst the ravenous force that is the sonic fanbase.

its a 7/10 but the best possible 7/10. its worth playing but don't buy this at full price. i got my moneys worth but that doesn't mean you're guaranteed to. this game is a really good step in the right direction, but i hope future games aren't just more 'step in the right direction' games. they've got a great foundation here where there's room for improvement in all aspects, so here's hoping the next game truly nails it. but at the very least, this game made me feel like a kid again and it reminded me why i was a sonic fan in the first place, he's just cool as hell man.",,
no ultra-wide support 🤬,,
"The music and art is within an application and not just as files, what a rip off. Inaddition to that the game has major preformance issues after retry.",,
"its really weird playing a Sonic Team game that doesnt suck, considering they were basically the laughing stock of my childhood post Sonic Adventure 2 (obviously with a few standouts like generations, but that was literally 11 years ago).

So far, i'm pretty impressed. The open world is just okay, the story is whatever, but the goal of the game is to unlock the actual stages, which play like the generations ones, and so far they haven't missed. Short, 1 minute levels with great music, and stage design that actually seems like they give a damn if the player is having fun or not.

I'll definitely update my review later on, but this is a big step toward people being more optimistic about Sonic, even if it isn't a standout game, it's a great leap forward for a franchise that was crashing and burning.

Negatives so far : 30 fps cutscenes in 2022, frame rate capped at 60????

I'm not sure if it's because the cutscenes are optimized for console, but they look horrible. The lighting and shadows are terrible. The in-game gameplay looks a lot better, which is pretty funny that we've gotten to that point.",,

This game is an insult to anyone who like the sonic franchise. It is so unbelievably boring that I don't even understand how anyone actually managed to torture themselves enough to finish the game let alone 100% complete it.

For starters, it is SLOW. Whenever you are not boosting you move at a glacial crawl and when you're boosting you move at speeds which are borderline uncontrollable combined with the fact they have a stupid system where you do 'tricks' when flying off surfaces you will often times randomly fly off of surfaces and in doing so it locks your ability to change direction at all. When it isn't busy being an absolutely nightmare to control, its busy giving you no control at all as 90% of the game are sequences that are basically just cutscenes where the game does everything for you. It is relentless in the fact it does this hundreds upon hundreds of times as it wants you to do ""puzzles"" to get collectibles in order to advance the story and when it randomly decides to give you back control it often times wants you to do a quick sequence of events to stay on course, god forbid you don't know what to do because the camera is so zoomed in you cant see anything. Oh and when you do fall off whatever you were climbing on half the time it will completely just disappear from view as the render distance on this game is atrociously low.

Not only are the actual levels few and far between, the music in them can be best described as uninspired and the design of them is an obvious attempt at nostalgia bait using designs from old games. If that wasn't bad enough the levels themselves are incredibly short with most being less than a minute in length which they try to pad out by making your already atrociously slow movement speed even slower.

The game also likes to have you believe there is ""combat"" to it when in reality the combat has zero substance outside of spamming the attack button, non of the combos flow together well and thats assuming they even let you do them as a ton of enemies have invulnerability that makes it mandatory to run around them in a circle while holding down a button to make them vulnerable. When you do eventually get them vulnerable they will usually go down in one or two hits making the entire thing feel shallow and lazy, and thats assuming you even bother doing combat.

On top of all of this, if you do manage to get through the slogfest that is the core gameplay loop, the story itself is so incredibly bland that it'll put even the most diehard sonic fans to sleep watching it. If you don't hate yourself quite so much you can alternatively choose to farm up fishing tokens and just fish for them which is ironically faster than doing literally anything else in the game.

This game is a poor excuse for a sonic game and is more of a fishing simulator than it is a functional game. It's not even a good fishing simulator.",,
"Edit:
I got the game working.
Still remains not recommended.
Controls go from being slippery to stiff with no inbetween

"The combat and bosses of this game are absolute trash, the open world would be better if there wasn`t so many enemy that pull your camera away or lock you camera certain way, and you can`t run pass certain ones because even if you are in the others side of the map the game thinks you are still in battle so you can`t pause or do quests.

Side quests and story ""missions"" are unnecessary mini-games which 85% of the time are not fun (not you fishing mini-game, you`re the best) or a pretty stiff cutscene of 2 characters talking with the same character expression and emotion that of Plank from Ed, Edd and Eddy.

"The elephant in the room regarding the open world design of this game is Breath of the Wild, a game that not only breathed new life into its own series back in 2017, but inadvertently spawned a wave of imitators that wouldn't pop up for at least a few years after the fact (you can’t make a game like Elden Ring in just a weekend). Sonic Frontiers is clearly drawing inspiration from this title, and while this isn’t a terrible thing on the face of it, I’m intensely bothered by the approach taken by Sonic Team. On the surface, both games are strikingly similar: A desolate, wide open map to explore, exceedingly simple puzzles sprinkled across the land, an emphasis on player growth in its collectables, and short cutscenes that add almost nothing but small moments of character growth to bolster the main plot. A common critique I’ve seen levied at Breath of the Wild over the years is that the land of Hyrule is boring to traverse, that nothing you do ever feels significant and that there’s nothing truly special to be discovered. I obviously resent this notion, but the reason why its crept back up in my mind is how Sonic Frontiers just feels like that imaginary game people have occasionally punched down on for 5 years. While many will bring up these two games in the same conversation primarily as a point of praise for Sonic, I feel like the core of each game couldn’t be any different.

Sure, it may be true that not every single task you perform is Breath of the Wild is exemplary, the secret to their success is one word: freedom. The freedom to go anywhere, do anything, see new sights, play at your own pace, and tie it in a nice bow at the end of it all. There are more granular elements to the game I adore, like how truly alive the world actually feels, but the thing that stands out the most to me in this concoction of fun is how decision making affects the game on such a massive scale. It’s not just that the game gives you a stat boosting item for a large portion of puzzles, it’s that you have to make the choice between boosting health or stamina. The world can be vicious early on with enemy camps dangling good early-game rewards on a string just in your grasp, so upgrading health might be desirable. At the same time, having a higher stamina bar is all but essential to make some of the more treacherous climbs in the game, and may also inadvertently make some combat encounters easier on the defensive if you need a hasty escape plan. While both of these can be mitigated somewhat through clever uses of the cooking system, it’s this consideration for player choice and their long term consequences that really make Breath of the Wild special to me, and go some way towards recapturing what made the original The Legend of Zelda feel like such a magical bolt of lighting on the industry.

No such consideration exists in Sonic Frontiers. Every task feels like it's being done for the sake of itself, rather than acting as a vehicle for interesting engagements with the world. Stat boosting has no bearing on how you play the game and does nothing but make combat slightly less tedious, so those rewards you get for completing puzzles may as well not exist. Enemy encounters similarly feel slapdash, there was not a single fight in my 15 hours of playtime that instilled any excitement in me whatsoever and I was tired of fighting the same mobs and minibosses by the time I saw them more than once. I guess it must appeal to someone that there are hundreds of little things on the map that go in one ear and out the other, but it certainly doesn’t to me. Frankly I don’t feel like this new approach fits the playground philosophy of Sonic in the slightest, and unless they come into the next game with a fresh mind on how puzzles and combat are designed, I think this approach should just be scrapped altogether. If Breath of the Wild was Zelda’s come to Jesus moment, Frontiers is Sonic’s JESUS IS KING moment.

I don’t wanna rip this game away from anyone who’s having a good time with it, after suffering for years with no reinvention I can totally buy that this game would be the one that ties everyone together and brings back a feeling of hope for this series that hasn’t been felt on this scale since Sonic Generations. That said, I’d be lying if I said I enjoyed this on any level. This genuinely might just be a case of me growing up and this type of thing not really being for me anymore, which would be a genuine shame if that's the case. This series that once felt like a cause for joy and celebration in my life now feels trite to me, like the ship is finally sinking and the Captain is trying everything in their power to keep the cruise afloat. I’m sure they’ll still find some way to wrangle me back in to see how the blue bastard is doing in the future, but there’s no doubt that the spark is starting to fade for me.",,
HYPER SHADIC CONFIRMED FOR NEXT GAME,,
SEGA hired this man!,,
"The game is not bad, just not deserving of an overwhelming positive reviews that it currently have.

The good:
The story is... well, who cares. We get pulled in a world, for some reason Sonic is the only one not pulled in a ghost mode, and you try to pull your friends. No idea how, but well, it's Sonic it's not like it needs one.

The not so good:
The graphics are... well, dated. Not great and the game is hiding most of the platforms and textures until you are close to them. So they appear out of thin air...
The boss are just awful. It is mostly based on the blocking mechanics, which is permanent so it's basically, just holding 2 buttons, and then an easy prompt. The mini-bosses at least have a pattern, while the boss are just boring.
The upgrade and maps are just long and useless. Most of the progression and upgrades will be done via the last maps fishing spot. I went from lvl 25/400 to fully upgraded on that map, just because of the fishing spot giving a lot of ressources.... Maps completions are useless. I didn't even do most of the mini-games in the last 2 maps as they are useless to have the necessary keys...

Overall, not a bad game, but just very underwhelming. It's interesting enough to hook you for a few hours, and then you kind of want to finish it, as you are just 1 or 2h away of finishing the game. Boring at the end, but too easy.",,
"It would be an understatement to say the 2010s were a difficult and painful time to be a lifelong fan of the Sonic series. Especially as a fan of the 3D Sonic titles, having been introduced to the series through Sonic Adventure 2 Battle. With such a legendary game being my first true experience with this franchise, it was bound to create a gold standard in my mind as to what a Sonic game should be.

The past decade of Sonic media was the complete opposite and outright refutation of that gold standard in almost every way. From dumbed down gameplay, awful characterization, poor writing, and just mediocre releases in general (Lost World, Forces). To me, it seemed like the Sonic franchise would never see another quality release again outside of games like Mania.

That line of thinking changed when I finally played Sonic Frontiers after a year of anticipation and even small glimmers of hope. And yeah, that hope was well placed.

The gameplay is solid and sometimes offers legitimate challenge. Where the gameplay really shines is in the combat, which is a new, and very bold direction for the series. Instead of just throwing himself at enemies, destroying them instantly, Sonic now deals out all sorts of attacks and combos like it's Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, albeit less complex. It really brought to mind memories of all the Sonic animations I watched on Newgrounds as a kid where the GBA character sprites were pitted in intense, anime-esque battles.

As for the characterization and narrative, Ian Flynn delivers a huge breath of fresh air from the past decade of ""Baldy McNosehair"" garbage as Sonic and co are written closer to how they were in the 2000s, rather than the ""meta"" caricatures we've been following since 2010.

All in all, it really does feel like Sonic Team has finally stopped running from the fact that this franchise is essentially a Shonen with furries. Hopefully, they'll continue this trajectory and continue to make the games *they* want to make, rather than obeying the whims of hack e-celebrities and non-fan journalists.

In short, Frontiers is a series course correction worth every single year of the Meta Era.

Absolutely worst game control for sonic game history, analogical, clunky... Do you remember main fetcher when sonic in air could attack in air, but if there no target - you will just dash in air?
Now that buttons is separate. 1 gave you option to dash in air and 2nd dash-atack to enemy. But if there NO ENEMY or stuff what you should to hit (like lever or button) you will make just regular kick by your hand or leg and COMPLITELY STOP YOUR HIGH-SONIC-CPEED IN THE MIDDLE OF AIR!!!

First boss fight? ehhh,,, it's some kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, abomination of dark-souls and Zelda fights with target system and dodge. it's was very cringe

"It's just generally poorly made. there's non-existent motion matching mechanics, the graphics are absolutely terrible with some of the bump maps being border-line inverted and the tiling on textures being absurdly egregious. The culling on assets is absolutely terrible at max settings. The textures are terrible, with minimal post processing to make up for it. The game has easily some of the worst kinetic movement I've felt in a game in a very long time, with horrible blend spaces between animations. You'd think, for a game with such an integral component being speed, that the speed would feel nice.

It doesn't help that the game, even in clearly pre-rendered cut scenes, is just absolutely hideous. I was willing to give Sonic another chance, but I cannot get past the fact that this was a waste of money and well below the standard of today's experience. It isn't fun, it doesn't have potential to be fun, and the level design ensures that. No IK Bones? Why, Sega? Why wouldn't you use root motion or utilize physics based game-play in some capacity? Why wouldn't you subdivide the terrain better? Why is all of the collision on things like rubble and stone complex instead of simple?

I'm not trying to ramble on and on. But I'm just generally disappointed in the game, and also myself for thinking it'd be anything different than more of the same from a franchise that hasn't been interesting or worth experiencing in like 14 years.",,
"So... I'm revising my review... I still think this game is overrated but enjoyable. I wouldn't recommend to someone interested in getting into sonic.

This game isn't bad but it has some flaws that I can't really look past for a sonic game. So, for me, I like boost formula. Boosting through enemies and sending them flying was fun in past games, but you can't do that here. I know it's more about combat but, you kill basic enemies with one homing attack or a drop dash, why can't the boost do it too? At least in the Cyber Space levels or something. Another thing about boosting is that you have to hold forward while boosting, I feel that's kind of annoying since some moments are automated and don't require you to use the control stick but once their done you just stop on a dime. But it's not a BIG deal.

Also sonic controls like garbage, I found out you can change how much control you have over turning which makes it much better but I feel like the default settings are too low. Bosses are just button mashing and QTE's which isn't horrible but they can be very tedious and boring since some involve A LOT of waiting like squid.

Aside from that, Music is good, story is pretty good albeit similar to forces in a few ways, and running around the open world is pretty fun. If you're open to new mechanics in sonic or a die hard fan then this game will probably be great for you. But if you are a purist or pretty new to the series I'd say start with the classics or generations.",,

"This'll sound hyperbolic but I've literally played free fangames that do this better and Super Sonic isn't locked to boring boss fights. I thought we got over this phase, Sega.

This game looks like Sonic 06 with the attempt at ""realistic"" on the Overworld and plays like the bad parts of Generations and the repetitive uninspired bosses of Colours. It feels like you're running around an open Unreal Engine map that you collect stuff in, like you could've bought the Overworld in an asset shop. There's traditional levels but they're just more rehashes of previous games' levels and only serve the purpose of collecting more Overworld stuff so you can beat up the bosses in boring, scripted Sonic Adventure fights. Several times. The levels themselves barely last a minute, most of your playtime through them will be spent retrying because of how tight the par times are (and how limited/weird the movement options are compared to Generations) in order to get keys for overworld stuff.

What little there is to ""combat"" can be completely trivialised by holding L1 and R1 as it makes you invincible, you stop time and get to beat up enemies at your leisure. In bosses it gives you a huge amount of free damage, there is literally no challenge or anything interesting happening in boss fights besides the awful pop music. I don't know why the game has a skill tree when you have God Mode from the start. The skills themselves are pretty lame anyway, they're not practical at all except the infinite sonic boom kicks which decimate some enemies. The others are extremely slow and flashy, with over the top animations only to hit one single enemy. This game feels half-baked, if that. Uninspired? It has no personality. I can't put that part into words.

I can't get over how weird momentum and inertia feel in this game.
You stop on a dime for everything, except when the game decides to yeet you but then stops you again? Every action either completely kills your speed or grossly overcorrects. It feels so clunky. I wasn't a fan of Generations' speed and how completely free-form it was but it was better than this, you had room to play with it. Homing attacks remind me of the ones in Sonic 06 but for Shadow, where you'd be instantly stopped and then have to gather speed again. The ""combat"" definitely feels like Sonic 06 shadow. Where you mash homing attacks as punches and kicks..

I don't know what I was expecting but I disappointed.
It feels like a step back, where everything it's doing is mediocre at best.
It wants to be open world but there's nothing cool to discover just grinding, it wants to be an Action RPG but the combat is broken, it wants to be Shadow of the Colossus but the Colossi are uninteresting, they're all the same.

I'll just play Sonic GT or something.
In fact I recommend people try that game instead of wasting their money on this, or get Generations, that game has lots of mods that easily outshine anything Frontiers can do. At least Forces and Sonic 06 were funny-bad. This is a competent nothing burger.

To get anywhere you gotta upgrade yourself just to beat bosses.

Little tid-bits of the map to even see where your going.

Upgrade, but then when you move to next chapter oh that upgrade goes away to where you have to get it again.

This game has moment's where it buffer lag's when you make a movement and the lock on especially sucks.

This game's maybe a 5 out of 10 for sonic game's but i'm not really getting the story much from it, and am skipping cut-scene's cause it just feel's like ton's of talking to pass game play time.

My major issues were:
The Camera which is kind of expected from a 3D Sonic game.
Somehow the homing attack feels worse to use.
Constant animations/cutscenes that really just don't need to play repeatedly. Activating, Entering, and Leaving a Stage, Unlocking and Getting a Chaos Emerald, unlocking a memory, mini boss fight introductions, etc do not need to play more than once. These really added up.",,

There are two major issues. The first is the camera. There are numerous points in mini-boss encounters where the camera is locked directly behind Sonic. Due to the twisting routes you simply cannot see when projectiles are approaching.

Worst of all is the controls. They're so good at the start, and the physics are wonderful throughout. I loved boosting, jumping, boosting again, and then homing-attacking onto a random enemy to cross large gaps. Unfortunately, this ability is neutered with upgrades. The game slowly introduces super moves that overwrite your actions if you jump and then boost. These moves are completely disconnected from your original moveset, with the homing-attack being replaced with a stop-in-place-projectile-cutscene. It is the literal opposite of everything that led to it, and a complete pace-breaker. The other buttons get similarly confusing overwrites. The double-jump is even overwritten. If you play this, just don't get the upgrades.

Finally, there's just a general lack of polish. I've been locked out of 3d movement, seen enemies become invincible, and run into a few other poorly-implemented features.

I loved these games growing up, but the jank in this game doesn't quite have the same charm.",,
"After more than 20 hours of playing this game I can safely say my feelings on it are quite,mixed. I like how they tried something different here with the open zone gameplay however the deeper I get into it the design flaws become apparent. Admittedly I'm not a patient Player and when I find myself getting lost trying to find certain pickups required to advance the story in a game this is where frustration starts to kick in with me and in the end I will likely just end up turning the game off. Next we have the terrible physics with the Cyberspace Stages, Stages that give a nod to past Sonic games, to be frank the physics here are the worst I have ever seen in a Sonic game since Sonic 4 and Sonic Forces. Now I'm not saying Sonic Frontiers is a bad game good Lord no far from it but there is definitely room for improvement and I look forward to seeing what Sonic Team have in store for us in the future.

This is another game where I wish Steam had an ok or neutral button.",,

"Sonic Frontiers is a phenomenal soundtrack.

Sonic Frontiers is a game so generic and trend-chasing that not even Ubisoft would want to be associated with it.

Sonic Frontiers is a truly TERRIBLE game that is terrified of letting you wander its flat lands and hills without an automated segment or camera curbstomping you in the direction it wants every four seconds. Sonic Frontiers is not a game, it's a glorified interactive cutscene with awful controls and janky physics that will throw you a mile away if you so much as think about boosting, and truly jawdropping half-baked mechanics that were not worked on past the initial testing before the game was rushed out.

Every aspect of Frontiers is buggy. EVERY. ASPECT. This is not hyperbole. It's truly broken on every fundamental level, from the way you will get flung on random terrain to the camera fighting you, to the way bosses will swing through you, around you, or randomly break you out of the forced axis you're stuck on. Characters turn and move like they're brick walls with jets glued to the bottom sides, which contrasts with the automation that guarantees EVERY move you make will always be one you can never truly be certain will work the way you intend.

I had 5 of the same boss fight music lapping over each other and playing in tandem, because the game wouldn't stop playing the track when I escaped from an overworld boss fight, but would layer another one on when I came back to try again.

This happens all the time. As does the awful pop-in that makes navigating the sky rails and paths a complete nightmare.

Sonic Frontiers would make Bethesda green with jealousy.

Playing the new update made me realize the buyers remorse I had for Frontiers on release-- and I 100%'d the game!-- and that Sonic games helmed by Sonic Team are truly, truly devoid of any talent or technical skill. Jesus Christ, what a genuinely awful game.

Decent script though. Too bad it's wasted on a game that makes Sonic 06 look like a Rockstar masterpiece by comparison.

Avoid. Under no circumstances should a genuinely awful game such as this be given money.",,

- O jogo é muito repetitivo e as coisas acontecem sem razão nenhuma com 0 de logica.
- Os puzzles são forçados e chatos.
- Navegar pela ilha é um saco e você for rápido demais sonic vira um míssil se joga pra fora do mapa o tempo todo e você não tem controle nenhum.

"Actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful, but it has a fishing mini-game so I am obligated to say it is good.













TL;DR it's bad. Awful even, but the Sonic fanbase is in a Stockholm Syndrome love with it since it's… I was going to say a not terrible Sonic game but it's still pretty mediocre even by Sonic standards.

The movement is terrible. Sonic, even with his max ring boost, feels sluggish. He also stops on a dime the moment the controller goes into neutral even while boosting, which one could argue is for the new focus on platforming. This falls apart when you realize that the stomp has performed that function just fine in past games and would have done so here as well. Most of the time it feels like he is physically attached to the ground, god forbid you accidentally go off any ledge that isn't a 90 degree angle or you'll be boosting into a kill zone. Running on an open field? Don't worry you are sure to just trip over a random rock and get sent flying in a random direction, usually backwards. Or hit a boost pad or spring that will send you into a on-rails section that it locks you into and proceeds to send you off in some random direction. You might think to jump to avoid these things and retain your speed, but you lose almost all momentum while in the air even while boosting. The only time the movement feels slightly wieldy is the on-rails sections where the game plays itself for you with your only input being boost, switch rails, or homing attack. Even then I found myself transfering rails while boosting to only occasionally sent flying backwards. The homing attacks lock on is flighty as well, you would think changing it to only lock on to what is on the screen would make it easier, but it still struggles when there are two or more options to hit. For some reason they made it so your boost, double jump, and most bafflingly stomp are only refreshed on the ground or certain objects, so if you double jump before homing attack an enemy hope you didn't plan to do that again. Air boost into a spring? Well, I hope you don't need to do that again. Want to use the Stomp for some precision landings in the line of vertical launch rings? Get ♥♥♥♥♥♥.

Next is the combat. It is slow and overly showy. I want to blast through basic enemies at sonic speeds, not homing attack them once and go through a whole combo while using unwieldy special attacks. When I see a big ass overworld boss that I have to run up the side of to hit their weak point I want to homing attack it once, get knocked off and run up again for the other two. Not go through a whole song and dance routine for all 3 of them. I can accept it during the boss battles, but half of those boil down to waiting to use the parry, then mashing once they hit you. Oh yeah, parrying is brain dead too, it isn't timing based like you'd think. Just hold it down and you are basically invincible for an attack before you get slow-mo and either rush in for the kill or hold it down if the game decides that's not how you beat this specific enemy so you better not get any ideas. My favorite move is the homing shot, which uses boost and homing attack so better hope you don't need to use the homing attack after boosting or you'll find that 9 times out of 10 you'll be left sitting in the air over a pit while your homing attack target dies and you no longer have a target to homing attack to.

The overworld and levels themselves are garbage as well. We all heard the joke ""SEGA actually hired the Nintendo-Hire-This-Man"" but it exists for a reason. Everything in the overworld looks like a basic unity asset flip with Sonic looking completely out of place. The only place this isn't the case is the levels but 3 of the 4 level archetypes are just a Generations asset flip, with the sole exception being the vaguely generic looking city levels. In lore it was described that the reason the levels were like that was because they were going through Sonic's memories, but I guess, like SEGA, Sonic can only remember Green Hill, Chemical Plant, and Sky Sanctuary. While only vaguely remembering what I think is supposed to be City Escape? Speaking of these levels it's not only the assets that are flipped but the level design as well. If you've played past Sonic games you'll probably recognize various layouts from Adventure 2, Unleashed, and most prominently Generations. They have a different coat of paint but they are still recognizable in a 15-year old making a Sonic OC from a template sort of way. Unfortunately the levels they don't outright lift from other games tend to be absolutely no fun at all.

I guess everything else is just the smaller nitpicking stuff that slowly built up to crush my enjoyment. I hated the upgrade system, at least half of it. The defense and offense fruits weren't that bad, but the Korok- I mean Kocos that blend in with the gray rocky terrain and buildings are a pain to find. It is even more painful to turn the Kocos in for your speed and ring upgrades. For the fruits all you need to do is go to the guy, turn in all the fruits at once, and get all your levels all at once. The Kocos? You have to individually level up one at a time in a menu that delays itself by a second before it will let you interact with it. It took me 30+ minutes of nothing but this menu to get to max speed and the best part I still felt slow after getting all the Kocos I needed from fishing. Menuing in this game overall is terrible especially for ♥♥♥♥ you want to just do fast, like resetting levels or fast traveling. Oh hey, you unlocked and completed that level and you think that would give you a fast travel spot? What are you stupid? Complete all the poorly aped challenges/puzzles to get the whole map view and then we'll unlock all the level statues as quick travel whether you ever touched them or not. Oh you're clicking on the fast travel point to go there? Sorry you need to switch to the fast travel tab you idiot. I mentioned it earlier, but the puzzles all feel like poorly aped versions of Breath of the Wild puzzles copy-pasted across the map. My favorite puzzles were the night time only puzzles, where you might think ""oh maybe it will have to be night to do a puzzle related to the moon and the stars, maybe a puzzle that has to do with light and darkness"" if you were playing a good game. No, it's the same glowing spots that only appear at night because SEGA wants to waste your time. ""Oh, so I'll just use the pass time function that all competent games with day-night cycles have to get it done now"" you might say, but no. There is no quick time passing, so if you are left with only one ""puzzle"" left you just have to sit there for about 10 minutes afk waiting for night to fall. Special shout out to my two favorite enemies, the one that takes control of the camera to fly away leaving a balloon trail for you to go up and kill it when I just want to pass by, and the group of robot wolfs that if you get too close to will circle in a trap that you can't jump out of as they one by one come out for you to slowly counter before you can leave.

The good things?
-The fishing minigame is simple but fun and it also gives you pretty much all the collectibles. You could ignore basically everything besides purple coins and the star shower event that gives you more purple coins to do more fishing and just unlock everything with Big.
-The interactions between Sonic and his Friends are pretty nice, a lot of nice character interactions and development that I'm sure will be disregarded immediately as soon as a new game comes out.
-Shadow the Hedgehog (the game) was made canon by a Eggman log you get from fishing.",,

"EDIT: happens much worse now in all sections of the game even the overworld

Has major issues on Windows 11 on some configurations. Freezing for like 5 sec straight and then only unfreezing for like 3 sec before freezing again for 5 sec at the start of the very first level where the player very first starts to control Sonic. If I push through it only happens in the one area of the level but is known to happen in many different Cyberspace areas...

If you have the ability to put Windows 10 on the same PC with this issue and boot the game in Windows 10 the freezing does not happen (according to others).

Checking the system requirements and I notice ONLY Win 10 is listed in both the minimum and recommended. So I guess they are launching an outdated game on day one since it doesn't even work on the current modern Operating System. . . Buyer beware!

EDIT: I have found a 'fix'. The worst kind of fix. Sometimes, seemingly at random when I launch the game, the five second freezing will instead last less than a second like a stutter. When that happens every single instance where this happens will be a stutter instead of a freeze UNTIL the next time I boot the game. Then I have to go to one of these spots and check if it is freezing or stuttering. If it is freezing, restart the game. If it is stuttering, for the love of god don't close the game if you can help it because it will continue to just stutter until the game actually closes. I can load other levels, load the title screen, load different saves, for that entire time the game is running the freezing will instead be a stutter, even if I run it for 6 hours straight. So basically I have to restart the game until the bug is tolerable and then I can play. Usually takes less than 5 restarts. . . (Pretty awful I know). At least I can play I guess",,

"This game received a lot of hype and when it released there was a lot of waxing from the sonic community. This game is unfortunately overrated for what it is. At most, it is fun to run around as sonic for a bit, but that should be true in many other games as well, so it's not even a unique benefit. The game feels grindy, slow, the bosses aren't always interesting and reuse assets, the big (interesting) boss fights are one and done, the story is there but it isn't exactly a masterpiece, just a little different than what was done before. I like the variety in fighting, but there's not a single opponent in the game besides the first ninja you fight that actually challenges you to the point that you feel like you have to fight with skill. The game had decent ideas, but bad execution. It didn't do enough to bring sonic to the modern age. An ok game.

Free DLC is good though, but I don't think even that could save this game from its base. More games like Sonic Mania and The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog please... but those were fan games. At this point, we probably need to accept that sonic just can't do 3D if the character remains under similar management. I hope I'm wrong.",,

The pros:

I LOVE the boss battles
Also, the soundtrack is amazing! It's like Sonic meets Metal Gear Rising

Cons:

Legit everything else
Forced camera angles when free roaming
To lock on to an enemy, you need to be within a meter or so, otherwise you'd no longer be locked on to that enemy.
Puzzle solving becomes tedious and straight out boring, especially since you need to do them to proceed
You need to often find certain stuff to progress, which is also tedious and boring
After beating a boss, you go to the next island and lose your super sonic state...then the whole process repeats

My experience playing it was ""I just wanna fight the next boss"" Since they're legit the best parts of the game.",,
"This game takes everything I loved about sonic games throws it away and adds a bunch of unnecessary features. I enjoyed games such as sonic adventure back in the day. I know I'm rare in my option sense people have been bashing sonic games lately and think it's great to turn sonic into something he was never before and never should have been. However sonic has built a huge fan base over the years and those people have come to love what sonic is. Removing everything that makes a sonic game and changing how the game is played should not be a thing. Just make a new character and series, and hopefully, it will gain a fan base. Don't ruin people's childhood by taking away the game's enjoyment and removing everything we know about sonic. Sega has been doing this way too much lately. Just feed off people's past love for the characters and expect people to enjoy the game no matter what they do only because the star (sonic) is in it.",,
"The DLC ruined the game for me. The rest of the cast are fun enough to play as & see interact with each other more, but the Towers are incredibly frustrating & stressful with no check points, & the the trials require parrying to succeed. I'm neuroatypical & have no sense of timing, I was able to brute force my way thorough the rest of the trials by dumb luck & lowering the difficulty, but the master king trial is absurd.

A boss rush gauntlet where most of the boss need you to parry them to damage them on a shared time limit is terrible. It's just padding for the sake of it. No way to increase the time you have cause they block rings & set all your hard earned stats to 1 (It's really insulting to the time I spent raising them).

Just cause something is given for free does not necessitate gratitude, after all, a flaming bag of excrement left on you door step is also free.",,
"EDIT: Prefacing this by saying I loved everything about the game, every hour I played of it I loved. I just wish there were more hours or it cost less, onwards with original review:

Collected every single memory fragment, completed every single mission on every cyberspace level and completed all the fishing spots. Also even left the game open at one point. With the time I left the game open removed it's like 25 hours to do everything the game has to offer. If we remove all the stuff I didn't even have to do for all achievements it's easily down to less than 20 hours. How the ♥♥♥♥ do you make a collectathon that's less than 20 hours. In entering the collectathon genre this game has brought the following comparisons from my library onto itself:

LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga - 100% - 90.9 hours
LEGO Worlds - Unlock everything, get a dragon and then kill another player with it - 74.3 hours
LEGO City Undercover - 100% - 65.5 hours (couple of game crashes that undid progress, round down to 60 hours)
Ty The Tasmanian Tiger - 100% v1.0 before Hardcore was added - 38.5 hours (did a hardcore run after it dropped that I ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up so reduce to like 30 hours)
The LEGO Ninjago Movie Video Game - 100% - 23.3 hours, this game was what I considered short for a collectathon, Sonic Frontiers HAS EVEN LESS in terms of stuff the devs actually expected a completionist to do

Now lets go for some other 100%s for comparisons sake:
Sonic Forces - 100% - 38.5 hours (Messed around doing Drill Wispon Avatar stage speedruns for a bit so reduce to 30, still a whole 50% longer to 100% than Frontiers)

Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition - 100% - 61.5 hours, just using this to show that even non-collectathons have 300% the hours of Sonic Frontiers to complete

Now, I love everything about this game, I just cannot recommend it at £50-£55 for like 20 hours of gameplay FOR A COMPLETIONIST which will be even less for a normal player. This is a ridiculous price for such little content. Loving the game itself I naturally do recommend buying it on 50% or larger sale. if you read this review and it's 50% or more off then this is a positive review, I think it's well worth it at that price, go ahead and just get it.",,

"FAST VERSION: It's good

SLOW VERSION:
The ""open zone"" distinction the developers kept pushing when the game was first announced is important, because it sets your expectations here. This isn't Sonic of the Wild, Sonic Impact, or anything else you might expect from the term ""open world""; it's just a Sonic game, but bigger. A good one, that is.

What I'm trying to say is that if you're a part of the ""Sonic had a rough transition to 3D"" crowd, or in that sub-18 market that's always so quick to spout ""Sonic was never good"" because his glory days were what kept their parents from getting laid sooner because they were too busy playing Sonic Adventure 2, there's nothing for you here. But if you earnestly believe that Sonic Unleashed was just misunderstood, or if you dare to dream of a Sonic Adventure 3, this is the most hopeful the series has looked in over a decade. The cyberspace stages hearken back to the days of good 3D Sonic, where you have to work for low times and every stage is a mix of reflexes and path finding to seek out the shortest route, while the open areas expand the concept into an enormous speed playground, and it's all just a joy to play. The movement feels good, the level design encourages experimenting instead of just boosting forward, and you'll inevitably find at least one stage that makes you feel like that critic from Ratatouille taking a bite and vividly remembering his childhood.

There are a number of diversions in the open zone aside from the traditional platforming challenges, like simple-but-entertaining puzzles that reveal the map or minibosses that tend to be a lot more exciting than you'd expect, but none of them really stand out on their own and they don't really feel like they're meant to. The meat of the game is the platforming, and the rest is just a side dish; the simplicity of the rest of it keeps any one thing from slowing the game down, which I assume is also why the fishing minigame isn't just Sega Bass Fishing ported into the game again (as much as I wish it was). All of it is fun, and you can easily rack up a lot of time with it all, but the brisk pace of how you come and go from each one feels fitting for a Sonic game.

The story in a Sonic game is normally not worth special mention, but it is worth saying that this one in particular is written by Ian Flynn, the writer of the current Sonic comics, which is great news for everyone except those three or four Ken Penders stans who never moved on. There's tons and tons of fanservice and continuity spread throughout the dialogues you can have with the various characters (maybe even a little too much name-dropping at times, but I won't look a gift horse in the mouth), and the main cast feels like they're finally back to their old selves after going through some sporadic shifts in writing throughout the recent games. The new antagonist in particular is one of my favorites in the series, and the overall storyline made good enough use of its time that I really hope they choose to keep letting Ian help out with the games.

It's easy to see where the budget started to taper off near the end of things, as environments start to get reused and the QA-tested polish starts to wear thin in some places, but by the time you hit that point you're already in so deep that it barely matters. This game is just a blast to play, even if it's not perfect, and I hope they decide to stick with this concept because I can't wait to see how they can expand on the idea next.",,
"Sonic feels slow in this game. Most of the stages are just reused assets from older games (ready for Green Hill Zone over and over?) The combat is clunky and you're constantly forced into it. I find myself avoiding most enemies because the combat feels so intrusive. The game begins to shine during free roam but then the pace is interrupted by a poorly designed boss fight or puzzle.

seems after generations , which was fun albiet stating to age a bit now there is no more decent 3d sonic games

is it a bad game? probably not but is it worth its current asking price? no way.",,
"It’s not often that I can’t finish a game, but I threw in the towel with this one. I felt like the controls and camera were constantly fighting me, combat was not fun, and I was finding myself just being bored while playing. I also found some of the fights frustrating, with unintuitive QTE’s that would result in an instant death and having to redo the entire fight over. I was very disappointed with this game overall",,
"Refunded it within 15 minutes. So extremely disappointed :(

-Cropped, low quality pre-rendered cut scenes
-LOCKED AT 30 OR 60 FPS
-Sonic controls like a f******* whale-watching boat, seriously it shouldn't take 8 tries to jump on some rings because Sonic handles like he's jumping through molasses

It felt disgusting and cheap to play, happiest part was getting my money back

Sad that the most polished Sonic game is still Sonic Adventure 2",,
"It's a console game ported to PC, so it has the limitations you would expect with things being unintuitive for PC keyboard and mouse users. There's no way to exit the game without Alt+F4 (force quitting) for a period of time, which is just ridiculous.

The game only auto-saves, so you can't quick save and exit at any point or prepare yourself for encounters, and you keep getting restarted from a point that you can't determine yourself, so you'll find yourself re-collecting rings and objects that you've already collected, over and over again when you die. Dying and resetting takes a long time. You feel like you're bashing your head against a boring wall. This makes for an immensely frustrating and annoying game.

The graphics are surprisingly terrible. The rain in the cutscenes looks like your graphics card is failing, with white speckles everywhere, and the characters look low resolution. The game offers a 2560x1080 display resolution setting, but keeps resetting itself back to 1920x1080. I tried multiple times to get the game to change and save it, but the setting is completely useless. I'm still confused about why it's offered.

Supposedly you can play a character other than Sonic now, but only in an ugly hologram form, and only at a certain point in the game after finishing a ton of storyline content and not from the beginning. That's really not what I expected and was excited about. I wanted to play Amy from the start.

The game is not for me.",,
"I waited so much for this game, got it on release date, 100% it with all achievements (without even trying because THIS GAME IS E A S Y) in less than a week, and I can just say that it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sucks. This has to be, without a doubt, the most miserable user experience I have ever seen/feel in a video game. This is simply unfinished.

First of all, I wanna talk about the pop-in, yeah, it's bad, really bad, but after a few minutes of playing you will just ignore it, so for me at least it wasn't a big deal. Now with the review:

***THIS REVIEW WAS POSTED ON LAUNCH WEEK BEFORE ALL THE UPDATES, STILL, EVEN WITH THE UPDATES THE GAME STILL SUCKS, LITERALLY THE ONLY THING THEY FIXED WAS THE LVL UP SYSTEM AND LET U DISABLE THE MAX SPEED ANIMATION (I EXPLAIN THAT STUFF LATER)***

The open zones are terrible, boring, with puzzles made for 3 year olds, and with the same BGM that gets annoying quickly. The realistic artstyle can work for Sonic games but when done right, here it looks hideous. Chaos Island (the 3rd one) has to be one of the most disgusting ""levels"" I've ever seen, locking you on 2D segments without any warning, pulling you out of any freedom of the 3D gameplay until you finish them or just let yourself fail them on purpose.

The ""Cyber Space"" stages (formely know as ""Action Stages"") control like total ♥♥♥♥, I swear to God I'm not crazy when I say Sonic Forces had better boost gameplay stages than this. The boost gauge is a joke, the physics are all wrong, it really makes you feel bad. And these have to be one of the easiest and most reused stages ever programed for a Sonic game. I do love the idea of using some levels from old games, this has SA2 levels! but they must stop reusing the Generations assets, those are 10+ year old!!! Green Hill, Chemical Plant and Angel Island as always, again, and again, and again. They tried to hype the new ""City Highway"" enviroments, yeah, a generic highway enviroment that is only used like 3 or 5 times in the entire game.

The UI is pathetic, probably AI generated, you can finish the skill tree in like an hour and after that you keep getting exp points to the end of time and there is absolutely no use for them. And the way you lvl up Speed and Ring capacity... damn, I don't even wanna talk about it, one must see it for himself... Also I love how there is this cool feature that if you max out your current ring capacity you get a cool video (EVERY DAMN TIME) of Sonic going sicko mode and unlocking his full speed, the thing is, you start the game with a max ring count of 400, like always 1 hit and you must collect them again, so because of that there is NO REASON AT ALL (only for the damn achievements) for you to lvl up your ring capacity, it will just make things more tedious lmaoooooo also if you lvl up your speed to the max lvl you have full speed forever making that part of the gameplay totally useless.

The combat looks cool and flashy, yeah, but DMC this is not, you can literally unlock the Sonic Boom attack (after like 10 minutes of playing I ♥♥♥♥ you not) and spam it, just hold LT and that's it, you don't need to do anything else, maybe a Cyloop here and there, but really, I swear I got throught the entire game just doing that, I bet this fight system wasn't even properly planned lmao

The story is trash, I don't understand why everyone praise it so much, it sucks, Sonic and friends get trapped in something like a virtual simulation, and then it turns out it's another planet?? I don't get it, Sonic gets infected by a damn virtual virus or some ♥♥♥♥ idk and then he is about to ♥♥♥♥ die for real (and for like the 5th time in the franchise) but is immediately saved by the power of friendship AS ALWAYS so that is just cringe and stupid. Eggman is the worst he has ever been, he is not bad here, just mean, like ""damn I hate Sonic but I don't give a damn really"". Sage is a totally unnecesary character, she isn't even the one controlling the giants, she was programed with the only job to just talk ♥♥♥♥ to Sonic during half the game and then ♥♥♥♥ sucks his ♥♥♥♥ because she things he is amazing, and thanks to her we can see Eggman is now a ♥♥♥♥ creepy ass lolicon with that ♥♥♥♥ he did at the very end of the final cutscene, what the actual ♥♥♥♥ was all of this??? Also what the ♥♥♥♥ was that final boss fight??????????? I really hope whoever came with the idea of making the damn final boss of a Sonic game a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ shoot them-up level gets fired.

THE COKO ARE DISGUSTING, ARE THEY MEANT TO BE CUTE? THEY ARE JUST ROCKS WITH HOLES IN THEM, THEY MAKE ME PUKE, AND THEY DO REALISTIC BABY SOUNDS, WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ SEGA. This story is about the original Chao race, since all the aliens on the visions are just Chaos from Sonic Adventure, so, again, there is no need for any of this, why making the Coko and not just use the good old Chao? They really are trying their best not to give a reason for having the Chao Garden back, huh.

I like that Big the Cat is here again, but the fishing minigame sucks too, JUST PRESS A AT THE RIGHT TIME, WOW, SO HARD. At least do a good fishing minigame because this can't even be called a ""minigame"", just a ""mini waste of time"". I miss Sonic's friends, they don't do ♥♥♥♥ in Generations and in Forces, now Big comes back out of nowhere and his stuff sucks, and poor Cream got shadow banned from the franchise lol

Now I'll point the only good thing from this game (+ more complaints lol):
- The idea of open zones is good, but implemented like ♥♥♥♥, I don't need every open world game be like Elden Ring or something, but damn, if you wanna do a open world like game with lvl up systems this one sucks. Open world for Sonic games work better as Open hubs like in SA1. AND AGAIN, IF YOU GONNA DO THE GAME OPEN WORLD HAVING THAT MUCH POP-UP SHOULD BE A SIN AND PUNISHED BY LAW, yeah I said you get used to it BUT THAT'S NO EXCUSE AT ALL.
- I liked Sonic interactions with Amy and Knuckles, with Amy they where cute, and with Kuckles they where really funny, but that's all, Tails again just cries all the time and they force so hard the part where Sonic tells him he is a great hero, I found hilarious how they throw the SA reference of Tails saving Station Square from being destroyed, yeah dude, that was in a game released 20+ years ago, dumbasses.
- The OST of some of the Cyber Space stages is cool, but most of them are just like 20sec loops because of how short the stages are. Of course the OST is great, it's a Sonic game after all, that's the only thing one can be sure about with these games, that the OST will bang, but sadly, as I said earlier, during the Open Zones exploration there is the same BGM again and again. THE BOSS FIGHTS SONGS ARE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GREAT, ALL OF THEM, but sadly you only heard them once and never again. (They added more songs as BGM in a free update, but all of them are songs from past titles, so they didn't even care to make new stuff, going around in the open world listening to ""SONIC HEROES"" is cringe af).
- I don't really liked all the references, most are cool, but this has so many it looks like a joke. I do love that this finally makes Sonic Unleashed canon, and that is amazing.

This game is a hard 4/10 at best, grab it at a low, low sale.

I can understand why some people say this game is good, or even praise it, but that's bad, the next game will be as lazy as this one, and that will be their fault. This is a bad product, with many, many flaws, and no one should be satisfied with it. If you guys keep making Sonic Team feel good with this then don't cry when they release a new game and it has the same problems, if not worst.

I hope the next one fixes all of the mistakes this one has, or better yet, scrap this entire idea and go back to making good boost games mixed with adventure style gameplay, like Unleashed did. Adventure like open world, connected by fun, NEW, and actually well made boost stages.

PD: sry if my english is bad, idk really, I'm mad, remebering this game makes me mad & sad.",,

This is already shaping up to be my favorite Sonic game yet, sure it has some flaws here and there, but holy crap I would be lying if I didn't say the combat is very fun to play with. ESPECIALLY THE COMBAT WITH SUPER SONIC! This game quite frankly has the best Super Sonic gameplay yet out of all the previous games, you aren't just spamming homing attacks or just tapping the titans to one shot them with super form. You actually have to fight with it and it feels so good to actually have this kind of combat system in place with Super Sonic and just normal Sonic. This is such a breath of fresh air that needed to be breathed into the franchise. I totally recommend getting this game if you ever wanted to give a Sonic game a try!",,

The combat feels terrible, but it doesn't belong in a sonic game anyways???

I would love to hear from other people that thinks this game is bad, because no shot this game should currently sit at Overwhelming Positive. I normally wouldn't leave a review, but it feels like a crime to say 95% of reviews like this game.",,
"Do not believe the hype or ""very positive"" review on Steam for this game. This game is another boring collectathon in an empty open world. It has some okay ""Sonic running and bouncing around at fast speed"" sections, but the combat is boring repetitive combos, the main enemies are boring looking, the graphics are not that good for a AAA title (while they are stylized, the environments are just ugly looking), and the music is dull dub-step with a few sung songs thrown in that don't have any energy to them. This game is an experiment from the Sonic developers to make a ""modern open world design"" Sonic game and while it doesn't completely fail and is playable; it is just boring and not that special or exciting. My rating: 5/10",,
this game is just bland at best,,
I've seen Game and Watch games run with a higher frame rate. (Minimum graphics and everything),,
"Honestly, this game is extremely over rated.
The story is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ joke, every major cut scene between characters are them just standing there talking to each other.
Cyberspace stages feel like ♥♥♥♥, and it's funny seeing them attempt to recreate Adventure 1/2 stages in it, and you can just feel how bad the game is in comparison to those games in terms of controls.

It's funny they let you fine tune your controls which really don't help much frankly) due to the fact they themselves can't actually do it so they try to give you free range on it.

The parry is such a joke, the fact that they upgrade it for the ""Super Duper Sonic"" fight to actually be a parry that's based on time is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hilarious. Hell, the fact that the final DLC is literally just a retcon because of how bad the base ending was is even better.

The music for boss fights are great, the boss fights themselves are honestly too easy but in all fairness, most Sonic bosses are, so it's whatever. The biggest issue lies in how the game controls, how bad the open world is. It's lifeless, has constant pop in issues, is a graphical mess with shadows and running around everywhere, there is really awful and boring challenges scattered around to make you engage in the game more but mostly just fail in that regard (Jump romp, dodging left and right on light up pads, parry test challenges that are irrelevant since you just hold the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥), random forced 2D sections in a 3D open world that break left and right as try to run through them.

I understand people think ""well mediocre 7/10 sonic is still great!"" but honestly I don't even think this game deserves that. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ joke when compared to dreamcast era 3d games,",,
"a truly horrible game and even more destitute platformer that apes zelda botw and mario odyssey in the laziest ways and still manages to be borderline unplayable with how awful it controls. also some of the most boring and rote open-world design i've seen in a minute, even though i have the capacity for self-loathing to actually play through some ubisoft stuff.

"♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ THAT FIRST BOSS FIGHT AM I RIGHT?!

Edit:FR though. Need to call out the haters. Take a seat cause I'm tired of the cancer that is the sonic ""fan"" base.

People who say sonic frontiers is basically NGS have or never will play the game and are only jumping on a hate train. Why?

Sonic Frontiers only similarity to NGS is that it uses the same engine (which is actually been used for sonic games since Sonic Unleashed) and that it's open world. Nothing else. PSO2NGS actually uses the engine that sonic team has been using to make sonic games. This is not uncommon for ANY game dev studio as they do not have to re-learn a new engine which is very hard to do and takes time. New devs for battlefield had many problems learning Frostbite which was one of the reasons why the recent battlefield game was extremely buggy at launch. Most of the original devs had left and where the only ones experienced with the engine. Sega has been doing this since the dreamcast. Infact the first Phantasy Star Online used the same engine as sonic adventure 1, 2, and Sonic Heros. I fail to see how this is a bad thing. Even PSO1 and sonic adventure/heroes use some of the same SOUND effects. This is not uncommon in many games. Even big triple A titles do this.

Game play mechanics are completely different since it's a sonic game. Basically you take sonic unleashed/generations tone down the boost to be controllable, and add actual combat mechanics other than homing attack, combined with actual combos not button mashing. Think about it, in NGS you click 3 mouse buttons and use shift to switch to your other 3 attacks on your pallet. You can basically mindlessly fight anything and win.

In sonic frontiers mindlessly attacking will have a boss make you look like a fool especially if it's a titan. Each overworld mini boss has its own mechanics to take it down. I say over world because even though it is ""open world"" it plays more of a over world than a open world.

The graphics are 100x better than NGS will ever be. Textures are much higher resolution and geometry detail is much more detailed. Then again NGS is a free to play game and while it still looks ""good"" it doesn't need to be so overwhelming that lower end computers can't run it. That would mean less players less customers Yada Yada...

It's good to have criticism for a game to improve, but the ""fans"" that look at it and say it's NGS are just the same fans that ♥♥♥♥ on every sonic game and never actually play them which is why most of the Sonic fan base is a cancer of NPCs. There are no UQs in sonic frontiers, there is not mineral collecting, the only thing you level up is your attack damage and defense. No weapons, no augmenting, no anything from NGS. Infact it actually takes more ideas from breath of the wild than anything SEGA has done before which isn't a bad thing cause they were good ideas and well implemented. It made sense for the setting of the game.

Sega took what the fans couldn't do and made it work. A open world sonic game with good controls for sonic and the camera and with good rewarding FUN combat mechanics and speed mechanics and allowed them to even be adjustable by the player in the settings. Sonic fans have been wanting a open world before NGS or BoTW was even thought of and they all failed cause no one could get the controls or mechanics right. Which is very hard to do in such a big game like open world games.

People should definitely play the game and they will change their opinion how it's a copy paste NGS game before jumping on the hate train with the other NPCs that never play sonic anyways cause they are truly missing out on a good sonic game that's actually fun to play.",,
"i need someone to explain to me why traversing these boring ass islands, getting locked into annoying 2D sections that interrupt exploration, doing the same three easy challenges that sometimes you can only do at night for some reason, fighting boss fights that are easier than Kirby bosses, and watching cut scenes where a nonexistent story plays out and leads to you FIGHTING THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ MOON is somehow a well made and good video game. all fights are a joke, just hold two buttons and now they cant hurt you. want a sonic game that actually looks good? well sorry buddy best we can do is plop sonic in unreal engine 4 and set the draw distance to a abnormally low amount. want a good game after waiting 7 years for a new one? well screw you here's an unpolished mess that took nearly a year for QOA and Gameplay changes that should of been there since the beginning to be added in.",,
"definitely good if youre a sonic fan but honestly cant recommend it to anyone outside of the scene. the true final boss is locked behind difficulty, and . overall thoughts are very conflicted. if steam had a thumbs in the middle rating i would pick that but i cant really recommend this game! i had fun but it feels like the bones of something that could be so much better",,
"The parry mechanic in this game during the second boss fight ruined this game for me. The mechanics in the game were annoying enough to deal with throughout the game, but making a boss fight purely revolve around this mechanic as janky as it is, is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The story is weak, the puzzles are boring and I was really hoping to feel more super when playing super sonic. Interesting concepts for future games, but this game is a trash pilot for something in the future is my guess.",,
"We've all suffered with the bad sonic games after Sonic Adventure 2. The best we got was Sonic Mania, but never a good 3D version as the older adventure games.

Well, while slow at first... They finally pulled off a good 3D game again. Honestly was surprised... And of course, choose the high speed layout if you're a Sonic Adventure fan, really changes how the game plays.",,

Hi so I came to ask if the game sonic frontiers is meant to lag cause when I played the game it was very glitchy and I wanted to know if this was because my laptop can't handle 20 GB or it is because the game is glitchy its self?,,
"Probably one of the worst games in the entire series imo. It's nothing but a glorified Tech Demo full of some of the worst design decisions you will ever see in a video game.

The fact that Sonic Fans are calling this game a ""Step in the Right Direction"" ""Goat"" and ""Peak"" further proves how far the standards have dropped for these fans.

The Writing is extremely poor and the story spends a majority of it's runtime attempting to set itself up and then drops the entire plot on the player within a span of 10 minutes. The Combat in the game is flawed and boils down to nothing but mashing buttons as every enemy you encounter in the entire game can be beaten by simply mashing the attack button.

The Lack of an Art Direction is disappointing. The game is absolutely so depressing to look at it shocks me how it was okayed by anyone on the Team. The Platforming is nothing more but jumping around on squares and cubes that are placed in the sky because the lack of an art direction completely limited the level design and that's not even counting that all the Cyberspace Stages in the game are simply recycled from previous entries in the series.

The Soundtrack once again proves that Sonic would be better off just releasing Soundtrack Albums. The Soundtrack is the only reason why anyone should play the game but you can also listen to the music for free on the internet without having to buy this rip-off $60 Game.

The updates are also a mess for the most part. While Update 1 and 2 offered some mediocre content. Update 3 has completely broken the game and resulted in it being unplayable for quite a bit of people.

It's impossible for me to recommend Sonic Frontiers. Please....just so play something else....anything else. Not this.",,

Awful. Dismal open world sections with Sonic features shoehorned it lazily.

This is very off brand for Sonic - it doesn't feel like a Sonic game -even if it wasn't labelled as such - it would still be a bad game. The little Sonic Colours type sections are fine - but then just buy Sonic Colours if you want a 3D Sonic experience? Colours is fine for 20 minute blasts, despite the dreadful music (ironically my one positive for Sonic Frontiers is the soundtrack - it's very good).

"Sonic Frontiers is an under-cooked and unoriginal mess. For a series greatly known for it's beautiful, colorful, and unique worlds such as the vibrant green hills and the busy bright cities, this game decides to throw out all of what made Sonic special and went for the most basic and plain open world theme with just grass, desert, and volcano. And then grass again for some reason. And again. Out of all the Sonic levels, you were inspired by these? OK.

Sonic is the slowest he's ever felt. Especially in the cyberspace. The cyberspace is the dumbest excuse possible. Oh, so Sonic needs to regain his memories and play through Green Hill and Chemical Plant again. Like in Sonic Generations... and Forces... and Mania... how original!! Look, I would've been cool if the open world was themed on Green Hill and Chemical Plant, but the linear format with them has gotten so stale... At least the level design is great right? Of course it is! The cyberspace has got incredible level design. Since it's from other better games. Yeah, I liked Sonic Unleashed, Generations, and Adventure 1+2. I don't want to pay money to play them again, but worse. The engine control and physics were not designed for these levels. Putting them here will not make your game good because you know once they run out of levels to steal their game would be awful.

The combat is not as cool as they'd want it to be. You just mash the attack button. You don't really need to do any combos since you level up quickly anyway. And they don't look good. Sonic jumps in the air and throws balls at the enemy- What is this? Is this what the character is known for? The animation is god awful.

Voice direction is bad too. The character is now a 40 year old man. I thought he was 15. But hey, at least the dark story pays off. Sonic's friends are completely different. They're so lifeless. They don't move or animate, they're just talking. Reading a script. Why do the animations look straight out of a fan game? Sonic himself doesn't animate that much and it's not to be neglected for an open world game where he's the only focus. Anyways, I'm tired of talking about this game. Go buy Spark the Electric Jester 3 instead of this game.",,
Sorry sega i cant do the 60 fps anymore,,
"Frustrating controls, terrible camera system, boring and empty game world. Has all of the worst elements of open-world games. The graphics are the only thing I can praise. Worst Sonic game since Sonic '06.",,

i wish that i could give this a double thumbs down.
sonic forces is better and sonic forces is one of the single worst games ever made
final horizons update is the kinda ♥♥♥♥ that makes you want to burn down orphanages",,

I played the entire thing on switch ignore my hours. I'm not articulating my thoughts this game just turned me off the series entirely and I feel like hating,,
,,
"Hi, ive always seen sonic as a mediocre franchise but this one sticks out.
The game is a generally a fun and good experience, but i also think its missing a lot of polish.

-The graphics are sick but it also has a lot of pop in and some parts of the world(s) feel a bit lifeless
-It's fun to run around the overworld
but it sucks when you accidentally run into a boost pad or launch thing that forces you onto a completely different path
-levels and some boss battles randomly change the physics and controls which is just kind of weird?? The control stick just doesnt make you turn as far as you'd normally would for example???? huh??
-The levels still have the forced sonic scripted segments. Where sonic does something cool but you are just kinda looking at it like: i wish i did that something cool, you know??
-General vibes are good
-Music is insanely good
-dialog sucks ass, feels like a middle school play where everyone is trying to show off how cool, dramatic and quirky they are

overall good game
but some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ parts :)",,
"This game is awful. It's an unfinished, broken, buggy mess of a game that spends too much time doing everything to be even marginally good at any of it.

The main game is a meandering, lacklustre campaign that will leave you wishing you could just play an actual Sonic game that works, and the godawful DLC campaign has such an astronomically bad concept of the meaning of ""game design"", that you'll wonder how this series has consistently returned after so many absolute miscarriages of entries. The experience somehow straddles the line between shockingly untested and unsurprisingly unfinished every second of misery it somehow squeezes out of you.

Admittedly, the Cyber Space themes are some of the best songs the franchise has had since Sonic CD. I suppose even a broken, smashed up, weathered old clock is still probably good if you need glass to stab someone with.",,

"empty,predictable, ost carried fasho. aint reach a new frontier with this ♥♥♥♥",,
"I couldn't launch the game at first, apparently because it wanted to use integrated graphics. But once I changed that, the game runs beautifully and is a lot of fun. Best Sonic game in a long time. Sonic's gravity is a little weird but the movement seems like it has a high skill ceiling, which is cool as a Doom/Quake player. Frontiers also seems to borrow a few moves from Spark the Electric Jester which every Sonic fan should play.",,
Gotta go fast!,,
"pretty good for a ue3 tech demo, can't wait for what these indie devs do next",,
"EDIT: As of latest update, it doesn't even boot up at all anymore, I have waited months to play the story expansion but this has never been fixed and I cannot play the game anymore. Thanks SEGA!

it's mid overall; the beginning is pretty fun, island 2 is the best but after that it falls off pretty hard

this has been resolved, but is still something that happened -> (also, the latest update just broke the game, it won't even boot at all right now, so sega clearly doesn't want me to beat the crappy final boss.)

update 1 (seed and sounding): there are clear QoL improvements that weren't even announced, which I can applaud for! although, they're very simple changes that should've been made befoooore the game released, so I'm not going to applaud too much. jukebox is okay, probably would've given me more enjoyment if the game was good enough for me to do another full playthrough... wait, this game didn't already have time trials for multiple cyberspace levels?? guess that shows how much I did not care for arcade mode",,
"Ignore the 'professional reviewers' downrating this game. Its excellent. Both as a Sonic game and a Action-Adventure open world game in general.

- There's small set piece levels where you go fast, get red rings, try to get actually challenging S ranks and platform.
- There's more varied open world puzzles, platforming and wide areas to go fast with multiple paths as well as room for creative movement.
- Story is actually touching for a Sonic game.
- Nice progression.

There are some negatives though.
- 2D set piece levels can feel janky, as though you're fighting the controls to move Sonic.
- Momentum when airborne really is an issue. It feels like some unknown force suddenly kills your speed when you air boost or jump at times. My guess is the devs did this to avoid people careening like a cannonball everywhere but it should be tinkered with (mods have already done this).

All in all. Yes. Recommend.",,
"Absolutely not worth $60. You can use some mods to make it better, but you definitely shouldn't reward Sega for continuing this trend of pushing out mid-tier slop by paying full price.

I almost set this to negative because of the horrendous fanfic-level dialogue, but at the end of the day there were three free content updates pushed through by the team, and the last one suggests to me that someone was listening to what people were saying. I think that's respectable, especially from a huge company like this that craps all over Sonic every chance it gets.

Also ever since MGR I've been a slave to huge spectacle boss fights, even when they're pathetically easy like in this game.",,

"THIS GAME DOES NOT SHOW YOU WHERE TO F#NG GO THERE IS A MAP FOR NOTHING THERE ARE NO INSTRUCTIONS TO THE MISSION NOTHING.
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE 0/10",,
this game SUCK!!++!1,,
"Please please PLEASE! If you are reading this and you are new to the Sonic series, I beg you to spend your money elsewhere first. Nearly everything in this game is done much better in previous Sonic games, and the open world doesn't make up for anything this game has to offer. There are levels from previous titles that are near copies and don't play as well or are just outright frustrating to play because of the character movement differences.

Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2 Battle have a much more enjoyable story and level design. After the story mode, loads of side content opens up and offers more than 20 hours of play time. Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Colors barely have a story but have much better boost gameplay. Sonic Generations is a much better game too (but even less story than colors).

If you are already a Sonic fan and really really need a new Sonic game go ahead and bite. That's the only reason I'll recommend this game.

I really don't want to attack the community, but if you really want good, and I mean GOOD Sonic games, then we can't be treating this lukewarm title as the second coming of Christ. You deserve better, I deserve better, and we know Sonic Team is better than this.",,
"I might've liked this game, I've heard wonderful things about the gameplay, unfortunately, either due to incompetence or lack of time, either of which are Sega's fault, I am unable to even make it past the initial developer splash screens.
When your 60 dollar game can't even get me to the main menu, then you don't deserve my respect.
When and if this gets patched, I may actually write a proper review of the game itself.
Once again I was unable to experience this game at all, I spent well over 5 hours attempting to get this to work, and spent 45 minutes (Edit: I gave the game 2 hours more as of this edit, simply just hoping it was a super long loading screen, even if the game would have loaded, (it didn't) I'm not waiting 2 hours every time I wanna play the game.) hoping my efforts had paid off after launching the game several times over, just attempting to get to the main menu.
Could there be something I could do to fix it? Maybe so, however it shouldn't fall on the consumer to fix the developer's problems.

Chao gardens are the most requested feature in the entire franchise and the only form of replay value in a sonic game. This is the first one I've bought since SA2 because they havent included them up to this point, and while I did want to support this game for the direction theyve taken, I can't give it a good review. Sorry, Sonic.

Edit: Did not sign up to play space invaders. Signed up for Sonic. Got Space Invaders.",,
The game is clearly made for consoles with PC as an afterthought. The menus are frustrating to navigate with a keyboard and mouse and the game-play is unpolished on this input. It is also locked at either 60 or 30 FPS no matter what causing bad frame timings on a monitor with a higher refresh rate. I would recommend either buying the game on a console or buying it with a controller to enjoy the game.,,

"Really hated this game, sadly. I wanted to love it so bad, and been excited for this release all year...

I've loved all things Sonic since Sega Genesis days, but this was hugely disappointing for me:
-graphics feel about 5 years old (running 3060ti here)
-constant glitches/get stuck in random corners
-absolutely awful storyline/writing (annoying as sin)
-constant annoying ""info"" messages pause gameplay and are rarely useful
-open world could have been very cool but just sucks/not interesting after 90 minutes
-new ""battle engine"" is really not fun at all. Jumping and mashing square to punch is all we get and very boring. Definitely not the smooth and cool timing/angle strategy of the past, that varied with the bosses/characters.

It all just feels super janky and dumb. Overall was not a good time for me, and really ruined all my fond memories of Sonic in the past. Been a HUGE fan up to this point.

The final blow was 32:9 feature didn't work. 5120x1440 option had the black bars on the side not matter what. While its listed under game options, but won't work at all after many resets, game restarts, and troubleshooting. There is some hack out there you could try, but the image gets very distorted and wasn't worth my time.

I absolutely expected to love and recommend this, but I just can't. My first negative steam review, not a crazy person here. This is the biggest game letdown of the year. Just my opinion...",,

"The open world doesn't even look like a sonic universe. They went with a realistic looking graphics which don't fit the aesthetic. There are one or two stages where the graphics look like sonic and there are awesome. Its massively disappointing to get a taste of what they could have done.

The major reason I won't be continue to play this game however are the broken boss battles. Second Boss is impossible without reading a guide. You don't need the guide to know how to beat it, you need the guide just to figure out how to attack it. The normal attack button is not even an option and the game doesn't even tell you this. Slamming buttons will do nothing because its a very specific thing you have to do that the game doesn't even tell you.

I have no interest in playing a game that turns boss battles into a promptless quick time event. I have no problems with QTE typically, but not even given a prompt on what you expect the player to press is absurd.",,

You feel yourself start to get bored but then it throws something at you to keep you on your toes again and draws you back in and then it cycles on.

Theres something jarring about it though, Grinding the rails feels good and you feel a rush on top of that but they look off, they look like squiggly lines from a distance almost like eye floaters. Animation feels a bit stiff and the enemies (so far) look bland, not really colourful and not well thought out.

The graphics are good but they really need to fix the pop-in. Pop-in is terrible. I've had rocks appear right in front of me and landed on top of air which was a rock that didnt render in time. I've had a bird flew below me and straight into a tower so its like the birds lack AI they are just part of the scenery.

Theres definitely something good here but I can only describe this as like a previous-gen launch title, it tries to be something big but theres little bits here and there that pull it back. I think the game just needed another 3 months in the oven to prefect",,

"Voicing sounds stale and awful, it's like they're just reading the sripts and not inputting any emotions.

Clipping through some bosses as super sonic because of scripts.

When you're boosting, you come to a dead stop on a pebble/twig or you get launched sky high as if it's the Silver 'boss-fight' in Sonic '06.

In Big's fishing mini game, there's a distortion/aura or whatever around sonic and the fishing pole, when looking at the water.

The speed just isn't there outside of boosting, when you jump during a boost it's like sonic's face gets blown by a giant leafblower, while sonic is strapped by a rubber band to a bunch of boulders. Even in the gate-levels, if the camera is at certain angles, no matter which way you try to move Sonic to...he's just going in a very slow pace, don't try to boost there either...you'll fall of edges.

Leveling up attack and defence instantly upgrades to the max depending on how much seeds you're got at that time, but leveling speed and rings...that's 1 BY 1....I spend about 1-1,5 hours total just to level up speed and rings to the max at the elder koko.

""World bosses"" are a joke, no real challenge, just boost/cyloop/mash attack button.

Finally at last boss of the game...IT'S NOT EVEN EGGMAN...it's a purple moon/planet???
I was expecting something decent...like an actual fight...all i had to do was tap 1 single button at the right time 3x to win as a quick-time event....the most dissappointing final boss fight ever.

Skillpoints become obsolete after getting the very few skills available, yet they keep piling up after you got all the few skills.

There's a I't doesn't even tell you how fast you're going, all you see is a arrow moving like you see in a car...no numbers or any other indication.

Story-wise...i stopped paying attention after the 1st island, not much going on besides 'Gotta save my friends!', 'Get the Chaos Emerald' or 'Why are we enemies?', i'd have loved to known more about 'the Ancients', simply because they look like Chaos in Sonic Adventure 1.

The trailers looked very promising, but the game itself was more dissappointing then when you hear your parents say they're dissappointed in you for a massacre that you yourself started...which (in my opinion) the team making this game has done.

The only plus-side i have is that they reference previous games...wish i could get a refund and get my time back......-10/10....end of rant #NotmySonic",,

Lmao, I have no idea what the hell I'm doing. I played two normal Sonic stages which last under 2 minutes. To play more Sonic stages you would need to beat these easy mmo knock-off bosses to advance the story. The concept of Sonic being open-world is cool. This game fails to deliver that aspect. The game feels empty like a hollow of the franchise's glory shell.

The last Sonic game I own was Sonic Unleash. That game was peak Sonic gameplay with so many fun mechanics to make Sonic the character beloved to be. I cannot for the life of me lie to myself that the controls are clunky as hell. Stiff to be frank. The story makes absolutely no sense prior to any Sonic game attempt to connect believable characters like Tails, and Amy in an awkward sandbox. The main antagonist is some emo girl or boy who can't really tell these days that commands robots to enslave humanity or whatever. Does not sound or feel like a Sonic game.

Sonic Frontiers was doomed from the start. It seems Sega is getting collaboration from Capcom so I guess the director of the game gets a bailout. To the Sonic fans that trick themselves into believing this is a good game, WAKE UP. The wool has been pulled over your eyes. This is game is a cash grab from a developer that made no effort to make a polished Sonic game like Sonic Colors. It is no wonder why the Sonic movies were such a huge success compared to their mediocre games. That is because the directors and developers listen to their fans. With that said for those who love Sonic wait for this game to be on sale. IT IS NOT WORTH THE $65. At times I feel like I was playing a beta. Didn't sit well with me with that feeling.",,

A horrible waste of $60 sa sorry excuse for a game. i cant believe sonic team cant make a SONIC GAME,,
60 fps cap. Might as well go play it on your Dreamcast,,
"this game could have been so much better then what it is, i love sonic but it's games have fallen off over the years sadly, this game tries to do what it is not which is sonic dx, this game feels more like running up to arcade machines for levels and doesn't provide the player free range in those now sonic dx may have pushed you through some levels but it allowed you to explore most of them on your own and choose a wide verity of characters where this game doesn't seem to because of this i cant really recommend this game.",,
"Little dissapointed, honestly. Graphics and soundtrack are reasonably good. The story seems.... pretty awful, but it's a Sonic game. I don't expect an epic story out if it. There are sonic games where the story was surprisingly good... but this doesn't feel like one of them. The general concept of the game is neat, having split the game between short classic-style levels and open-exploration of the main island.

The cyber levels (The more classic-themed levels) are a nice concept, but the controls are clunky and the forced camera movement is fairly annoying. The levels are built as speed running levels, but the developers failed to grasp the movement fluidity that speed run platformers fun. As an added note, they should have included a button for quickly restarting the level. I realize the extra 3-5 button presses may not seem like much, but when you have to continually do it while trying to perfect a section of the level 5 seconds into the run, it gets grating really fast. Again, the developers went for a speed-run setup but didn't grasp the concept fully.

The open-world was a pretty neat concept and had a lot of neat aspects. Combat was reasonably fun, plenty of little collectibles to go around. The movement controls feel less clunky as a result of more camera freedom and the movement controls are weirdly indepth. There's settings for max speed, acceleration speed, starting speed, and steering speed along with all the standard camera sensitivity sliders. I say weird, but I do think it was pretty nice that they allowed for such custimization. I personally had to tinker around with it to turning speed without causing motion sickness (for which they offer some tips in-game, which was appreciated). My only real complaint of the island exploration is the horribly awkward bounding boxes for the level geometry. To be fair, it's hard to mesh the high-speed gameplay they were going for with a natural-looking map. There's going to be some weird interactions. And they are weird. Intensely weird. It's hard ot explain, it just looks so awkward, but it's hardly something I'd be too concerned about.

The classic levels are what really killed it for me. I can't say I'd recommend the game. It's painful to see4 a sonic game botch a speed-running concept.",,
"TL:DR at the end

I do NOT recommend playing Sonic Frontiers on a cheap laptop. In communicating with the support team at SEGA, I discovered that I needed the minimum requirements, listed below.

Minimum:
Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system
OS: Windows 10
Processor: Intel Core i5-3470 or AMD Ryzen 5 1400
Memory: 8 GB RAM
Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660, 2 GB or AMD Radeon HD 7870, 2 GB
DirectX: Version 11
Storage: 30 GB available space
Additional Notes: 720p Low @ 30 FPS. Requires a CPU which supports the AVX and SSE4 instruction set.

I incorrectly made the assumption that the majority of the issues was the game's fault, but nope, it's my own stupid self's fault. What I SHOULD have done was checked the system requirements BEFORE purchase and making sure everything on my end was up to date. I am rewriting my game review as well, based on what little I was able to play on PC and will give my opinion on the Switch version instead, since I can play it fully there. I'm fairly certain part of the crashes were caused by the extremely detailed textures found in the overworlds, so at least I can say it's good enough to have crashed my game. Visually, the pop-in is an annoyance but bearable enough to ignore it. The music is very good, it is extremely cinematic and emotional, minus the minigame music. Voice acting is wonderful and full of emotion. Controls are much smoother and Sonic is much lighter, whereas I found the opposite to be the case in Sonic Forces, so that's an upgrade. I haven't gotten too far in the storyline as a result of my ignorance of the PC specs required, but so far I am engaged with it. Cybserspace is decent, but could be better in terms of level design. whereas the open-world prospect is full of promise and is a nice direction for the franchise. It's not perfect, but I'd say that after a careful re-examination of Sonic Frontiers, I'd give it a solid 7.5/10.",,
"It's okay. Will update more as I get further, but not sure I'm gonna finish this.

Edit: Changing this to positive. Solid game. Still not sure I'm going to finish this, but just mostly because I'm tired of open world stuff for now. I wish the cyberspace levels were longer.",,

It's the same crap it's always been. Yet another copy paste of the same formula as Unleashed/Colors/Generations/Forces, except now with a bland open world with nothing to do

I start the game by having to collect 10 ""Amy tokens"". I spend over an hour doing that and I get a 1 minute cutscene, then I have to find another 20 tokens, for another short cutscene. It's like Superman 64 with the rings crap..

And Sonic is SO SLOW. Even with top speed sonics boosting speed is slower than his running speed in sonic Adventure 1 & 2.

I miss the variety, I miss the interesting stories, I just want Sonic Adventure 3. A nice fun 3D platformer with fun open areas to explore with fast paced action. The only ""Levels"" in this game are rare and far between and it's just the same linear rail racer levels that Generations and Forces had. This Franchise died after Sonic Heroes and I do not seeing it come back",,

This doesn't felt like a sonic game. Taking It's story so serious..which is hella cringe. Also, who wants another open world game? I prefer sonic colors instead this, even sonic forces better. I renfunded my first sonic game.. I even prefer sonic 4 instead of this.

Buggy, open world seems so empty. I don't know what to do after I just thrown into this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ open world. Bosses and robots doesn't feel like ""sonic game"". It's like anime and their models ugly. Copy paste metalic-red bosses and evangelion? style.

No man. I prefer my old-good ganigani. Also, wtf is combo? Sonic punches and doing combos? Bruh.",,

trash,,
"Played for 30min and had to ask for a refund! 79.99$ for what seem like a 39.99$ game no thank you. Controls are trash, game play is trash, I waited longer to install than it took me to see the huge mistake I had made purchasing this game. I have never been a true Sonic fan, and this pitiful game just made it even worse.

Before you pay, think.. ""is a game that plays as if its 10y old with none of the refinement worth my time""? Cost isn't worth it, but neither is the time you can spend playing something else..",,
"Unimpressed.

- never ending nickle and dime tutorials/notifications. The game steals the camera to show you 3 ridiculous enemies are nearby. I feel like I can't just play the game
- frame rate capped at 60 fps... this is 2022. Lol there's an option for 30fps?
- The graphics feel like they were designed for a PS3.

I wouldn't mind playing through this, but it's 100% not a $59.99 game. It's a $20 game at best and someone needs to mod it so that 50% of the game time isn't spent on the camera taking control to show you that 3 fluffy bunnies are nearby. So annoying.",,
"wish steam had a sideways thumb option because this game is mid as ♥♥♥♥. While better than the last 3 sonic games, this game is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ slog to get through after the first island. The core gameplay loop of fight miniboss, activate and play cyberspace levels to get keys, use keys to unlock and collect the chaos emeralds, talk to friends till you can play a slapped together minigame to get the last 2 emeralds, fight the boss as super sonic and repeat till the game is done get's BORING. late in the game you just wanna grind the items in big's fishing minigame.

The cyberspace levels are way too short and not designed well and just reuse level designs from generations, SA2 and unleashed. there is almost no creativity to these bite sized levels and the 1 minute nature of these levels are a detriment because you start getting a flow to these levels just for them to end abruptly. unleashed is the only boost game that had levels that were perfect size.

The island design after the first is bad. just BAD. so much backtracking, you'll spend half an hour figuring out where the ♥♥♥♥ to go and how to get there. it's not great.

the pop-in is the worse ♥♥♥♥ I've ever seen in a 3D video game. there is no excuse sonic fans can give for this. it's LAZY. ESPECIALLY for a 60$ game coming out in 2022.

Has denuvo drm to top it all off. I don't know why sega keeps wanting to shove this snakeoil ♥♥♥♥ in their games and keep making their consumers put up with it locking them out of their games all willy nilly but i guess it's here to stay.

sonic controls well and the super sonic fights are about the only positives i can give. theres about two tracks that i actually like that being vandalize and undefeatable. the rest of the edm ♥♥♥♥ and screamo ♥♥♥♥, i don't care for and doesn't fit sonic.

The story and characterization hasn't been this good since sonic unleashed. I don't know if it's because they let ian flynn from the comics help with the story or sonic team wanted to actually TRY this time or a mixture of both but the story is pretty alright. sage is an interesting character and her being setup as eggman's daughter gives good characterization. some lines of dialouge borders on zoomer cringe though and ian needs to take it easy with the references.

and the final boss is ikaruga. it doesn't fit and it's jarring. I'm not playing a shmup here. this is like having puyo puyo as the second boss in sonic mania, it doesn't fit.

buy if you're a sonic fan cause it IS better than the last 3 pieces of ♥♥♥♥ games sonic team has farted out but this game is lazily done and filled to the brim with reused assets.",,

"Quite possibly the worst sonic experience i have had to date...
I dnt normally do reviews but i cannot understand how this game is rated so positively to be honest.
I played for 45m and refunded the game on steam.
Now, it may just not be for me and my tastes but the game is just not fun at all.

Artistically and graphically= 10/10
I loved the environments, crisp and gorgeous.

Sound = 7-8/10
The music sometimes was on point exp boss fights.

Gameplay: 3-5/10
Bugs everywhere. I could handle that though if it wernt for how slow sonic is + the glitch and janky nature of the controls. It is simply atrocious. From flying off the map cause you tripped on a step to the momentum issues, to the fighting of enemies. Sonics greatest foe is how garbage it is to control him and how not fun it is to play through the multiple, precise platforms etc. Never once did i ever feel like i was playing sonic the hedgehog but it certainly felt like i was playing his geriatric 2nd cousin.

Level design:2-10 Were i to describe it in one word: Lazy, in 2 words: repetitive and confusing. Worst of all these all combined to make it a truly frustrating exp to go through, and that when you arnt finding bugs.

All in all i cannot understand its reception. that's why i am giving an honest review for all those that are going in to this. At least you wont be going in blind.

"Can't really say I enjoyed the game too much. Game seems kind of rubbish if you ask me. There was too much hype around this game, and the world feels empty and void of things. Animations need some shaping as well. I couldn't stay engagaged long enough to play more than a little over an hour of the game before I got off of it and uninstalled it.",,
"Atrocious camera, feels like a PS1 era game. Graphics are unimpressive and is poorly optimized, can run Cyberpunk but not Sonic at stable 60fps? You get High or Low settings, that's it, oh and capped at 60fps.

"Grew up with SADX and SA2. Compared to Sonic Forces its better, compared to older games, doesnt even come close. It feels way too empty even in the tutorial. Not for me. STOP MAKING OPEN WORLD GAMES THAT HAVE EMPTY WORLDS.

Controls are super janky, and the framerate is locked to 60fps? On PC? In 2022? For a single player game???

Will probably pick the game up when it goes on sale, but as far as I'm concerned the terrible voice acting, the empty world, and the controls are enough to drive me away for now.",,

"Sonic Frontiers is legit I think the worst game I think I have ever played. This game sucks.

Like for every reason imaginable.

God... its just so dogs**T
The controls are aweful, most of the actions glitch out, the S Ranks on levels are inhumanly impossible even on normal, the boss fights are f***ing so simple a plant could do it, the voice acting was phoned in, the world is f***ing empty and all of the new characters are SO BORING. Theres never really a clear objective and when there is its just collecting like 15 items randomly all over the map, to push forward a narrative you couldnt be paid to pay attention to. The music is so inconsistent and mind numbing that 1/10 songs is confusingly a jam but doesnt match up with anything else, and the world being as f***ing lame and empty as it is doesnt help to actually keep you awake anymore than the ambient music. I COULD KEEP GOING BUT LEGIT THIS GAME F***ING SUCKS. ITS NOT EVEN FUN

THE ONLY POSITIVE ABOUT THIS GAME IS THAT YOU GET A MONSTER HUNTER COSTUME FOR SONIC WHICH DOESN.T EVEN MAKE ANY F***ING SENSE.

This game has literally made me think about suic**e on multiple occasions
WHY WONT STEAM GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK FOR THIS ABOMINATION!!!!",,

I couldn't get past the 00's graphical looking opening video, Sonic's deeper voice, didn’t like the PC menu layout and I don’t think I’ve played a game in the last 10/20 years which doesn’t use the escape key to pause/settings, but instead I need to use the “P” key… that takes me back… Gameplay was meh, maybe I didn’t dive deep enough but all the little things just annoyed me. I could see they are going for a breath of the wild type of game with the stamina bar, robots and the gates/puzzles being like temples, but doesn’t seem very unique. Yes, a step in the right direction from previous games and maybe the gameplay gets better, but nothing in the first tutorial island made me want to play on. Sorry not for me ☹",,

Second portal and it's simply IMPOSSIBLE, I've cut it down to 55.1 seconds, you need 55. There is no where to put that .1 second except up Segas ***. You are CONTINUOUSLY fighting unresponsive controls in this. The number of times I hit a button and got a dead response. And just as infuriating is sonic WANTS to go SLOW. Everytime you shift from a rail or land from the air you restart from your slowest speed, you lose ALL momentum and Sonic makes no attempt to get the ground running. This reminds me of the show 'Flash', for all the talk about being ""super fast"" somehow the main character is the slowest SOB in the entire universe.",,

Once you get past the awful graphical issues, the controls you constantly have to fight, and the awful submissions, the game is entertaining. I wouldn't call this game good, but it's fun.

Did I mention I was playing on the ""High Speed Mode""? So yeah, don't waste your hard earned money on this game. It's honestly really sad since Sega can't make a good Sonic game anymore. The last time they made a good Sonic game was 11 years ago. Also Denuvo and bad Pop in.",,
"Just as bad as i expected it to be. I never had faith in this title and it failed to even slightly change my mind. I dont have much playtime but I can tell its not going to get better.

Everyone who says this is a good sonic game is either lying or we played a different game.",,
"Great Game but bit buggy. sonic will randomly stop for no reason which can cause him to loose momentum leading to a fall off an edge killing you. rather annoying, and for a 2022 game the graphics look a bit dated especially in the cutscenes.

putting these points aside i would still recommend this to play.

luv it,,
"Ok, just trust me on this, this game is garbage. First of all, when you open the options, the game doesn't auto-detect your setup, it just sets the resolution to 1080p so I was left in the dust with my 1440p monitor and had to manually adjust it. The game is capped at 60fps, yes folks, we have a 60fps cap in 2022. Then there are all these weird options like starting speed, boost speed, top speed, like did the developers accidentally leave their debug options on or something? Why would a player be controlling any of that stuff? Then I found out why, because Sonic controls like ass in this game. He feels so bad to control compared to Sonic Adventure 2, and yes I went back and played it just to confirm. When you're in mid-air he is impossible to control. So I guess it's just up to you to figure out how to make a good character controller because Sonic Team couldn't be arsed to figure it out.

When you first start the game, you see Eggman in a prerendered cutscene that looks so horrible it could have been a cutscene from Sonic Adventure, I am NOT ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you, go look the game's intro up on youtube if you don't believe me. Then they drop you into Green Hill Zone I guess, I dont know really, and I had to try like 10 times just to get the third red ring in the stage because Sonic controls like SH*T. The music is pretty good but I didn't bother playing more than 5 minutes of this piece of garbage. Bring back the Mania team so they can bring a path forward for this disgraced franchise.",,
"Even with flaws and technical jank, the game is still very enjoyable.

The negatives I could bring up have little to do with the actual game.
Floating platforms and springs will pop in rather than fade in (and you will rarely notice when moving around at speed).
The new physics in the Cyberspace levels takes some getting used to.
There's times when your momentum can come to a stop if you aren't holding forward.
It has Denuvo DRM which could lock you out if you find yourself rebooting the game frequently to tune outside settings.

But in spite of all that, the game itself is still so much fun.

At the time of this review, I'm 100% complete on the first two islands pending a second Super Sonic fight.
Yes, this game actually gives you multiple boss fights where you go in as Super Sonic.

The ""open zones"", as they call them, are actually really enjoyable to just move around it.
Figuring out how to reach a specific area makes for organic puzzles to solve that'll test your observation and deduction.
Being able to just mess around, collecting stuff, trying to reach interesting places, makes the moment to moment gameplay hard to put down at times.

The combat is simple but still fun
And it has actual counterplay to consider as many enemies will require using specific moves to take out.
There's mooks and mini bosses that all require their specific strategies to take out.
Learning how to maximize your damage output will be key later on, so you'll learn which moves to use to bring you combo up so you can activate Phantom Rush and melt the enemy.

The story so far is refreshing.
Gone is the ""meta"" humor. This is a Sonic story feels like it continues Adventure games.
We're actually allowed to have a serious story for a moment.
The new antagonist, Sage, is definitely looking to be complex and far more interesting than any Sonic villain we've had in a very long time.

For fans of Sonic old and new, this game is worth the trudge through the jank.
The PC port may have its flaws, so I'd understand if you'd rather go to the PS5 or something.
But whatever platform you play it on, if you have even a passing interest in a new modern Sonic game,
this is quite frankly the best we've had since Generations.",,

"i played for 47 minutes, i dont see any open worlds so far
i played 3 levels that each lasted a little bit over a minute
and i think that is made even worse, by the fact that sonic moves so slow
so that really hammers in even more how short these levels are
there was nothing really visually striking about the levels
and yet i had to lower the quality by the time the second cutscene hit because my framerate tanked to 13
on my pc that runs any other game at a consistent 59 fps
the ambient music is extremely unfitting for sonic and his entire character
amy is voiced like a worried mom, instead of the hyper little girl i know her as
sonic sounds like a grown man who wants to be a teen, when the original roger craig smith voice sounded like just a teen
im so disappointed

"OK....So I luv Sonic games. this is fun to play and I am having a blast.....BUUUUUT WTF SEGA. No 5120 x 1440 support. took me forever to figure out why it looked bad. And why, in God's name, does Sonic look like 2001 Sonic. I mean coulda done a better job. Doesn't take away from the game, the game is fun. Its a sonic game. I just hope you provide more support for extra wide screen, and higher FPS performance. As well as possibly a better sonic model, I mean....sub par on that front. I compare it the the Mario game on the switch ""Odyssey"" based on play, and character development. Yet at first touch, the cheaper knock off of the two. After playing for a bit I find it more fun than the Mario ""Odyssey"" game, as well as higher in difficulty. Which I personally like. Unless you are a super fan, most will feel the game might not be worth the current price. For a casual fan wait for a sale if you want a fun open world platformer, and I don't feel you will be disappointed.

Thumbs down For Dev's.....Hoping you patch and or change some stuff. Luv your company, hope yall improve the product and I look forward to changing this to a thumbs up.",,
"this game sucks.
it looks awful, has terrible voice acting, has the basic ""oh they're trapped in the metaverse"" plot (but that isnt saying much for sonic), and overall isnt fun. and also jesus $60 is very much not worth it for a sonic game, let alone this one.
0/10.",,
"A messy, experimental love letter, riddled with imperfections.

Yet despite it's flaws, I've enjoyed the time I've spent on this game greatly.

"Way too many things are frustrating or rip control out of your hands in really stupid, really dumb ways. If you just want to go somewhere, it's such an annoying, tedious slog. Hit a random booster, now you're trapped in a 2D section. Hit a random rock, now you're flying through the air in slow mo for awhile, deal with it. Random boss, have a cutscene, and now you can't interact with anything, wanna just go into the level because the boss is boring, tedious, and horridly unfun? Too bad, you're trapped in battle mode, deal with it. Can't figure out how to get to this island? Intended. Want to explore? Too damn bad, half the map is gated behind running from one end to the other 14 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ times to interact with the story before you can do that. Wanted to just find the fishing spot so you can fast travel after sitting through Press A, the minigame? Too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bad the area is gated behind story progression, get back to running across the map and getting hijacked by every stupid little bump in the road along the way.

It's just genuinely not worth it. The music, final island bosses, and storyline are genuinely the only good parts. Just watch someone play it on Youtube or something. It's not worth the grinding, frustrating, slog of tedium that the game insists on slamming into your face every few steps.

And yes, this is the best Sonic game we've gotten in a long time. We Sonic fans are, indeed, that utterly starved. We're dying out here.",,

In general, the game is laid back, easy to play, and runs seamlessly with very little time wasted on loading screens.

Downside: the story's plot is a little boring at this moment, but I'm barely through the first world. I expect that it will get better.",,

"Sonic Frontiers is a mixed bag for me. It stands on its own as a fun action game with tight controls, stunning graphics and unique concepts.

The only place it falls flat for me is as a Sonic game.

It is definitely way better than some of Sonic's previous 3D entries, but I think the personality a Sonic fan would come to know and love falls short in this title. For one, the music is very hit or miss. There are some bangers for sure, but it is apparent that Sonic Team took a more atmospheric approach this time to fit the whole ""trapped in cyberspace"" aesthetic. This means the majority of the time you'll be running, jumping, spinning and rail grinding to.... sad piano music.... In general, the game seems to take itself more seriously than a sonic game should.

Another thing that took getting used to was the speed of the game, or lack thereof. Sonic seems to run at a snail's pace compared to his other games. The only way to move at any real speed is to hold a button and boost, but that only lasts so long. It just felt weird to play a sonic game where you're not really going that fast.

These things didn't stop me from enjoying it, however. Every gripe I have with this game comes with several strong points right behind it. The controls are tight. The open world level design isn't bad either, and traversal is half the fun. Getting from A to B is seldom boring and there are many ways to approach the level. There also wasn't a single instance where janky controls or level design sabotaged the experience for me, like I would expect to happen in other 3D Sonic titles.

I would give the game an 8 out of 10. It's a masterpiece gameplay-wise but lacks the personality of a sonic game.",,
"Haven't played as much as I'd have liked so far, but damn it good. If it feels weird, tweak his speed in settings. Updates have helped the jank immensely",,

"It's would be an amazing open world Sonic game with great graphics that ran smoothly if only not for the fact that half the map only loads when you're literally one second away from said unloaded/non-rendered structure(s).

"This is honestly a pretty awesome game. Surprisingly, the stages are the least fun part and the open world is the most fun. It's buggy in the fun way where you can boost of a weird rock and fly in the air to reach new places. And the end of island bosses are pure shonen blood pumping fun. Give er a shot.",,

"Sonic Frontiers Review: A Bold Leap for the Blue Blur
Rating: 5/5
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Sonic Frontiers represents a bold new direction for the iconic franchise, blending open-world exploration with the classic speed and action that fans love. This fresh take on the Sonic formula breathes new life into the series, offering a vast and vibrant world that invites players to explore at their own pace. The game successfully marries Sonic’s high-octane gameplay with expansive environments, creating a dynamic and engaging experience.

The open-world design of Sonic Frontiers is its standout feature. The game’s various biomes are beautifully crafted, each offering unique landscapes and challenges. From lush forests to arid deserts, the world feels alive and begs to be explored. The freedom to roam and discover hidden secrets and side activities adds a layer of depth that hasn’t been seen in previous Sonic titles. This sense of exploration is enhanced by smooth transitions between traditional high-speed platforming sections and open-world traversal.

Combat in Sonic Frontiers has also seen significant improvements. The introduction of a more robust combat system with a variety of moves and combos makes encounters with enemies more engaging and strategic. The skill tree allows for meaningful progression, letting players tailor Sonic’s abilities to their preferred playstyle. Boss battles are a highlight, requiring quick reflexes and strategic thinking, and they often incorporate the environment in creative ways.

Overall, Sonic Frontiers is a refreshing and ambitious entry in the Sonic series. It successfully combines the thrill of Sonic’s speed with the freedom of an open world, offering a unique and satisfying experience for both longtime fans and newcomers. While there are occasional technical hiccups and some pacing issues, these are minor blemishes on an otherwise fantastic game. Sonic Frontiers sets a new standard for what a Sonic game can be, and it’s exciting to see where the franchise will go from here.",,

"The best Sonic game currently out until Shadow X Sonic Generations, it's extremely well made and everything is implemented so competently it's really fun and full of things to do.

My only gripe is when double jumping all your momentum stops on a dime and you can't go backwards when in mid air otherwise the controls are the best in the series.

Everything is awesome The music the level design the enemies the collectables all good content.

8/10

Definitely play this one.",,
"THIS GAME SLAPS!
Not only do you get Sonic Platforming levels but also a fascinating story, epic boss battles (This game needs a feature for rematching bosses) and the atmosphere of the main feature, overworld is pretty cool

I won't lie, the voice acting feels off now and again but only due to how energetic their tones usually are",,
"trying to play it as a serious sonic game yeah it sucks really bad, it's a solid 3/10 boring collectathon at best, but where it shines is as a goofy sonic physics sandbox, with physics mod it's a 9/10 with the added bonus of older sonic levels remade (even if with these physics they play worse than in their original games)",,
Definitely the best 3D Sonic game since Sonic Generations.,,

"good game although some of these minigames that are obligatory for story progression kinda suck, the fishing is fun, the movement is the most fun sonics been in like 10 years? and...the open zones are fine honestly, the random floating objects dont bother me too much but i can see how they can bother people",,
"Have yet to beat it and dont feel up for it at least not atm. In no way do I think this was bad, but I think it got over hyped to the point where I got to excited. The worlds seem bland and honestly when you start feeling them in parts now feel out of place. The game constantly takes my camera too much making it hard to control and worst of all rails are scripted meaning if you think you can do some cool skips youd be wrong. those this game has so many invisible walls like there was this upward bridge I went full speed up and tried to jump to the other side for an invisible wall to stop me. None of this makes the game bad way better than forces, 06 and even generations, but I think I expected too much from what people said about it that I got burn out fast",,
"When I first played this game, I was a bit skeptical about it all, and it didn't feel like Sonic, at first - but after getting to the second island, it finally hit me, and I'm glad to say that I very much enjoyed this game (for the most part at least). The story was brilliant, the gameplay felt fun (although I'm still a bit iffy on the combat), and I had a blast all the way to the end - I have to admit, I even teared up in the final cutscenes, though not as much as Sonic Adventure 2. Overall, I really enjoyed my time with this game.

However...

ENDGAME / DLC SPOILERS:





Keeping all this in mind, though, I'd happily replay the main story of Frontiers any day, or even jump back into the world to properly 100% it. While I don't think I'll ever touch the DLC again (unless I'm willing to play around with the extra characters), I enjoyed my time with this game and believe that it was worth it.",,

"WAAAW IT'S DEVIL METAL SONIC RISING: BREATH OF THE FINALLY A GOOD SONIC GAME FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS

while this game is no where near perfect, what makes it great is that it's ambitious. it might not have as great of boss fights and ost's as MGR and no where near the amount of complexity as dmc's combat or even as pact and well thought out open world from zelda, it just works amazingly when you combine all those mechanics and aspects with the added sonic speed exploration into one giant game that is in actuality two games in one which consists of the classic sonic levels and a new open world. whats also great is how the devs lesson to the community and fix upon the vast amount of flaws that the game initially had like sonic's movement and being unable to replay certain bosses, heck they even added a full on free story dlc and the classic sound tracks that you can listen to in the open world and much much more which more than made up for the flaws it might of had.",,

"I have not finished this game yet but so far I LOVE IT!!! The music is great, the story is riveting, and the gameplay is very fun! This may just be my favorite Sonic game. The character dialogue is great too! Definitely recommend!",,
"I'm conflicted about Sonic Frontiers, but I do recommend it for fans of the series. Sonic has had a history of jank-y 3-D outings as early as Sonic Adventure, with the camera fighting the player and controls usually sending you flying over a bottomless pit with their sensitivity, or making Sonic feel like he's a living lead weight. That said, I do enjoy this game more than most of his 3-D titles. This feels like a step into something that could be truly special, a feat not topped since the aforementioned Adventure game. What makes this game stand out is the over-world, the islands you'll traverse, explore and complete challenges across. This is the first sonic game I can remember which lets you as the player truly 'feel' the unbridled freedom that comes with Sonic's signature speed. You'll fly from one end of an island to the other, experiencing the very thing which I imagine most Sonic fans have craved, not just a taste, but a true understanding of what it is to be Sonic himself, seeing from his perspective as the world whizzes by you, the player a bolt of blue lightning tearing across the terrain. No longer wholly shackled by restricted level designs that take him from point a to point b and give him a rating, just to spit you the player back out into a level select screen, you have total control and can run as long and as far as you wish. I say 'wholly' because unfortunately, there are still some brakes to keep you from that perfect experience. Your ability to progress the story and visit the other islands will require some work and in most cases, tedious work. Firstly, you'll need to collect gears to open cyberspace portals. These gears can be found as objects in the ground requiring you to use the new cy-loop skill to unearth or as tokens dropped by the patrolling mini-bosses on the islands themselves. In the over-world you can through combat, exploration or completing challenges empower Sonic, collecting skill points and other rewards that allow you access to things like increases to maximum speed, special combo attacks and maximum ring count, to name a few. Inside cyberspace however, you're stripped of your increased accumulated power and forced into not only a slower running speed, but other control restrictions. The levels themselves won't take long to complete, but they're composed of tired stage themes and worse still, entire recycled layouts from other games, not the least of which being Sonic Generations. In cyberspace you'll gain tokens in the form of vault keys. These keys are necessary to open vaults in the over-world. The very fact that the keys themselves are only usable outside of cyberspace with players having to make the compromise of finishing re-used assets under arbitrary controls is such a slap in the face that when I first went into cyberspace, I caught a bad case of whiplash. If you're willing to go the distance and tackle cyberspace, there's one more issue you'll have to contend with. To get the most of each stage and the most vault keys possible, you'll need to complete objectives in the stages, these usually boiling down to meeting a set time for S rank, keeping a specific number of rings to the end, finding all of the red rings in the level, etc. I HEAVILY recommend that for each cyberspace stage you do, you take the time to find the red rings first. It's basically a free vault key when you get all five, and they're generally not hard to locate, but you might miss a few if you take the wrong paths along the way. The game is also courteous enough to keep your red ring progress between runs, so if for example you got three of them in the first try, you can go back and locate the other two for a vault key. Once you've gotten enough vault keys, a vault will unlock somewhere on the island, and you'll be able to grab the chaos emerald there. One other mandatory chore in the over-world this time is finding memory tokens all over the islands. These memory tokens will allow you progress the story, opening cut-scenes and dialogue between Sonic and his friends. Sometimes you'll find yourself having to in these sub-plots do little mini-games, but they aren't really a challenge. In fact, most of the game is devoid of any serious challenge. (Note: not every area marked with Sonic's pals on the mini-map requiring memory tokens is mandatory. You can skip them if you want, but you'll be tasked with finding a few to keep the narrative coherent.) When you're not in cyberspace or hunting memory tokens, you can expand your view of the islands, revealing places that would be obscured on the mini-map otherwise. To do this, you'll generally be playing the same mini-games or solving the same puzzles from as early as the first island to the last. Of the 'challenges' as they're called, I found the ones that have you racing to a further point on the map to be the most fun. I think they're the most 'Sonic' of the bunch. He's all about speed, right? When you've beat enough cyberspace levels to collect the necessary vault keys and retrieve your chaos emeralds you'll be able to take on the island bosses. This, this right here is the pinnacle of the game in my opinion, what sets it apart. When you encounter an island boss, you'll first have to climb them. Yes, literally climb them. This doesn't typically take long, but you might have to work for it in the cases of a few bosses. (some are smarter than others and in these encounters you'll have to catch up to them on something like a cyber ribbon-esque path being made by the boss in real-time.) When you finally ascend to the top of whatever metallic behemoth stands in your way, the seventh chaos emerald will be all but right in your grasp. Take the emerald and you'll transform, becoming Super Sonic, fully equipped with all of your previous stats, combat abilities and even impervious to damage! With the raw power of the hyper-sonic hedgehog unleashed, you'll be free to fly at the boss and take them down, metal music on the caliber of final boss tracks in previous Sonic games blasting, fueling you, cheering you on until you send the monsters packing and at a level of spectacle nothing short of, in a word, magnificent. Mechanically speaking, the bosses aren't difficult, but some will probably be more frustrating on a first try. This isn't helped by the fact that since the final update of the game your ability to parry attacks has gone from simply holding a button to actively timing strikes that weren't meant for the short window you're given during parrying. It's more than doable, but as someone who got the game after that update I felt a little cheated. The lack of telegraphing by the bosses themselves will add to the pain, so it's up to you to find the right moment and location to parry. Most of the bosses however can be pummeled to your heart's content so long as you position yourself correctly. When you've conquered a boss, you're given a suitably tremendous cut-scene of Super Sonic demolishing them, often in very creative ways that accentuate just how immeasurably powerful he is. With the boss obliterated, you'll move onto the next island, From here, it's effectively collecting the same emeralds in the same way and defeating bosses carrying your seventh chaos emerald until the credits roll in the base game. I won't spoil the alternate story (which you SHOULD go to immediately if you're playing on 'hard' or higher unless you REALLY enjoy a certain mini-game.) Having finished both stories, I can say I enjoyed my time with Sonic Frontiers despite some frustrations along the way. 6/10",,

With the new update there is so much customization to how sonic moves. You can fine tune everything to make him run how you feel he should.

I don't have too much to say on the game. If you don't like open world games and don't wish to put in the effort to learn all of the Glitches to pull off cool stunts, it's just not gonna be that good of a time. (Also why the hyuck are there Dash Panels in this game? There is NO POINT at which you should not have some boost. Even if you run out you can get it all back by just waiting a little bit.)",,
Sonic's speed-based game play lends itself very well to a largely open-world game. Running around and exploring the various locations and obstacles is very fun. Most fights apart from the big bosses aren't very difficult but need to be beaten in creative ways that are very fun. The story and characters are also enjoyable :),,

As a long time Sonic fan, because of history, I was skeptical about this title, and even waited up until about two weeks prior to typing this review to even get the game. (it was on sale) I have to say this is probably the most entertaining sonic title for me since Sonic Generations on the Xbox 360.
I love the callbacks they make to older titles and the love they show for people who have been with the series for a long time. The voice acting is superb, the graphics are superb, and the story (while not the most engaging) leaves me curious and wanting more with each progression made. It's a massive open-world collect-athon with Sonic mechanics included. The physics can get a little slippery when moving really fast, and sometimes I found myself slipping off edges or missing my jumps because Sonic would fling himself across the map if I boosted too soon while escalating an area. Some of the puzzles FORCE you to play in 2-D, which isn't a problem for certain areas, but when I'm B-lining it across the map and I accidentally hit a speed strip or a spring attached to one of these mentioned puzzles in the overworld, the camaera snaps and FORCES you into some of these 2-D loops and won't let you break out of them until you complete it or respawn.
All in all, I think the game is fantastic, there is an intermediate level curve for platforming and speedrunning, however the combat is pretty easy and I didn't have much issue with any of the in game bosses once I figured out their gimmick.
I would definitely give this title a try if you are into sonic games. If you are new to sonic games, I feel like it might be a little hard to follow certain story elements but that's just me. Don't pay 60$. Wait for it to go on sale.",,
Very good and fun game to play if your a sonic fan! I definitly recomend,,

"After a couple years of having Sonic in the back of my mind, I decided to return to the Sonic games with Sonic Frontier. I believe the last mainline Sonic game I picked up was Sonic Frontiers, which left a fairly bad taste in my mouth.

While Sonic Frontiers has its fair share of bugs and strange movement controls, playing this game was incredibly fun. The overworld could use a bit more detail and more identifiable landmarks, but that's about my only gripe with the game.",,

Please make the bosses work next time :)",,
"probably one of the best sonic game of all time unique combat system and completely fast paced and has a fast gameplay the combat system has new skills and abilities the abilities we nver saw in the previous sonic games the combat system with it's abilities are designed very all this might a little biased but i absolutely love that combat system it's something new smething fresh it's like it gives sonic an upgrade with that new combat system and as for the alot of people saying this gmae looks empty and there's nothing to do here it's WRONG!! don't listen to them infact the visual of of this game and the game itself is beautiful with it's great graphics and also if you're worried there's nothing to do in this game don't worry infact there's alot of stuff to do in this game it has collectible items like any open-world game has mini games,puzzles,side quests,tasks,even mini bossight you can literally just busting the mini bossights for fun so there's alot to do..",,
"Upon getting this game, I was enamoured by how good it felt at the time. I loved it for the same reasons anybody else did. Easy to understand gameplay which felt like it did a better job at exhibiting how platforming can change completely when the character can run super fast and jump really high. A more seriously toned story and villains/antagonists that actually feel somewhat threatening. Although I understand doing open zone puzzles can feel repetitive to some, it was fun enough for me at the time.

Back in 2022, I had to reset my PC. Upon getting everything reinstalled and booting up SF, everything was wiped down to my settings. Fast forward to now and this actually happens any time that I use another PC to run the game, no matter what Steam Cloud settings I have on. I've looked online for almost a week to find if even a single user has had the same thing happen upon reinstalling, but either no one has reinstalled the game since it came out or I'm the only one who has this problem.

I figured out this glitch way too late; too many hours to refund now. In the future I'm gonna have to choose between keeping a really old PC for this one game or reducing Sonic Frontiers to a $70 unused game slot in my Steam Library.

Even without this very devastating bug that may be a possibility for anyone, I feel that this game doesn't have enough going for it to say it's a good purchase. To get a bit nit-picky:

- Story honestly feels weird. (I haven't been able to beat the game yet, I didn't understand the fact that the game wipes it's save anytime I reinstall so I've lost my progress about 4 times now. It got spoiled to me by now, but obviously I'm going to hear about it the game's been out for 2 years) It always feels like the Sonic franchise gets hit by the Cosmic Reset Button from the comics anytime a new game comes out and there's new/old characters just slapped in that I'm supposed to care about.

- The references that sonic makes in his monologues (callbacks to old titles i.e. comparing Ares island
to Shamar, talking about Zavok, etc) are fun, but I would like to actually see something from earlier
stories show itself in some subsequent game for once.

- Music is too mellow and calm. Things only get hype in boss battles, and the only hype music available in Open Zone are said boss battle tracks. Honestly same goes for Cyberspace tracks imo. Feels like cheap EDM versions of Generations remixes.

And may God himself be with anyone who plays this game vanilla. I have a mod for just about any facet of the game and then some. Only then does the game not feel like a tedious nightmare chalk full of glitches and severely nerfed platforming where you have to do things exactly how the game intends without any room for nuance.

I have ~300 hours on this game, either steam or SF is so bugged that it can't even tell how long I've been playing .",,

i like this game more than i should. it has more problems than positive qualities but i also feel like it was made to appeal to my tastes specifically 9/10,,

Wow is the performance of this game bad. Like unplayable bad. Even for $20 its not worth it. The frustration of the studdering performance is really the biggest issue. Sega should be ashamed of what they did here. Its a disgrace.,,
peak sonic game,,
RHEHEHEE,,
Ray Tracing?? Path Tracing later ok,,
"As of the time I am writing this I have NOT completed the main story. But I can say before I purchased the game I had somethings in mind. 1. it was on sale for about $25 USD and 2. I was heavily reading into reviews. With those reviews I saw a lot of negatives at first. But any who here is my review so far. Its great. The story is not S tier by any means but its still a quality story. The way the character development is portrayed all the way to the wicked boss-fights I have had so far. The sound track is great along with the ""Skill Tree"" system. I will say the skill tree is a little overkill on how expensive each skill is but they are fun to use nonetheless. I have not encountered any game breaking bugs or really ANY bugs at all up to this point. So looking at everything such as Story, Characters, & Character development? I would give Sonic Frontiers a solid 8.5/10. I recommend that if you buy it, As soon as you launch it start a timer on your phone for 2 hours and just casually play through it within that time frame to get a feel for it. When the 2 hours are over then decide whether this game is worth the money or not.",,
Pretty good game but not the best either. Credits made me cry.,,

"Now that it's had time to cook, it's turned from a good game with some bad parts to a great game with hardly any snafus. It's not often that I encounter a game that I recommend buying at full price at steam, but this is one of them. Not only that, but it's actually superceded SADX as my second favorite game, and is now my second favorite game... only beaten by Sonic Adventure 2. Sega, take note, your support of modding and other good stuff you do for your fans is what keeps Sonic alive. I hope that you can take what you learned from this game and use it to make Sonic the Hedgehog return to former glory.",,

"Having 100%ed this game (before the uncannon ending update) I can say flat out, the game is worth it. a couple of caviots. The game uniquely lets you minorly change how Sonic moves, slow down speed, etc. Adjust these immediately, stopping on the dime is a flow KILLER. Outside of the base game settings being a bit ♥♥♥♥♥, this is a good Sonic game with a lot of heart to it. A bit buggy sometimes, and the DRM is stupid as ♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥ DRM, I cannot stress this enough, games' industry, stop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ using them. However outside of that, baller soundtrack, sick visuals, area designs are great, the platforming is unique and surprisingly varied. Good overall game. Get it on sale tho, $60 is a bit much.",,

"This game is freaking awesome.

I don't know if I would have ever paid or if I would ever recommend it at full price- but I picked this up for ~$25 USD. This game has its shortcomings which I will mention soon, but overall I would highly recommend playing this.

It's like if Breath of the Wild was fun. Tears of the Kingdom I got about 70 hours out of but never finished since it was too boring. This game constantly, after about 14 hours in as of writing this, KEEPS THROWING NEW MECHANICS AT ME!!!

Some of the bad I mentioned is almost perfectly summarized in the third island you visit called Chaos Island. The biggest problem is traversal, it's confusing, the map is slow and inconsistent, fast travel via menus is annoying to obtain (needs to be grinded in fishing, and some may HATE this minigame. I absolutely love it). The traversal is made its worst here for the map not showing how to actually get anywhere, but the worst part is this map is filled with 2d sections that lock your camera and movement into 2d whenever you enter them. The issue is when going at high speeds you WILL run into these by accident, and some you simply can not escape until you've gone through ALL of it. This admittedly frustrated me quite badly while playing.

Difficulty within the 2d stages in the game (yes, there are also full on 2d stages!) varies wildly. Some of these are so easy that I get an S rank while dying in the stage or wasting time. 1-2 on the very first world is actually a bit challenging and requires some decent time saving thoughts. I was hoping this trend would continue, and it kind of did? It seems random. You can argue that this is due to the open world nature of the game, but each world could easily get progressively difficult in these 2d stages in my opinion. Especially since they do get harder in one amazing way:

Learned mechanics and application of said mechanics.

This is game design 101, and while you may say this is the bare minimum for a game to pass, we're talking about a Sonic game. Let's be honest, base game design can be a hard ask sometimes from the Sonic Team (this is mostly in jest, I promise).

all seriousness, you are taught mechanics like dodging very early, and dashing across rings by pressing a button. Neither of these moves are entirely mandatory but can help make you go faster. So you aren't heavily punished for NOT using them, but you're instead extremely motivated to try to use them in order to optimize your game play (quick sidenote, it's not a lame Dark Souls level parry, you literally just hold a button lol, barely any timing needed). Feeling myself get better at using these mechanics in the first stage felt really cool, because I wasn't forced to use these... I was offered them and I got better because I practiced with them.

Traveling across rings was used a lot early on to make things faster, while not being NEEDED. But... guess what? World 2 comes along and BAM, there's a couple sections that show you early on that there is a huge path of rings through a great locked camera position. This is a required area to use this ability, you must use it to progress in a handful of locations in World 2. Now, keep in mind each of these positions are shown VERY early in your pathing through a smart camera lock. But none are sudden. World 3, BAM. There are sudden ones that require quick thinking to progress.

I can go even further explaining this. Even the most core mechanic of dashing to an enemy or object goes from very easy and simple, while doing so effectively can allow for very fast optimizations, meanwhile later on in World 2 and 3 there are plenty of required quick presses of that button.

Quick gushing about bosses. Fighting the first boss without the 7 emeralds then fighting it later with the emeralds feels awesome. Each boss feels progressively cooler. None of them are difficult, but that's... in my opinion okay. You are super sonic in these fights, and because of that... you feel powerful.

There aren't enough animations for super sonic, and for some reason the game doesn't support above 60fps nor does it support ultrawide monitors. One other annoying thing is on AMD graphics the water is super buggy in fishing. Nothing game play wise is hurt by this, thankfully. These are minor gripes though for me, just mentioning them in case you feel these are deal breakers. Oh, and the story sorta sucks. The characters rock though, and it's entertaining and honestly more compelling than both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom despite my bias leaning towards Zelda 100% in gaming.

I am again, ONLY 14 hours in and absolutely have an incredible perception of this game. For reference, I despise open world games and especially souls like games. This game is extremely friendly for beginners.

Let's finish with the best part of every Sega title: The freaking music!

This OST feels like the game itself, a slightly grown up version of Sonic! Replacing the butt rock with easy-core, which for reference is essentially the butt rock equivalent of post-hardcore music. The tracks here rule. Collecting extra tracks in game is icing on this cake. I wish there were more, personally. Maybe instead make them unlockable via fishing? That would give me TONS of incentive to grind fishing. Sega, use that OST! Everyone knows Sega games are well known for their amazing soundtracks.

EDIT: Finished the title days later. I keep all my words from above. What an incredible game!! I am doing the after story content right now and the exclusive music for Amy is also lovely.

Thanks for reading if you did. I will leave an update above this when I finish the game.",,
i love this game and they cooked with the soundtrack :>,,
Interesting story with lots of content to unlock and divulge in.,,
Giganto is mowing my lawn,,
eh its a sonic game its a step up from forces but i still think theirs issues controls are very slippery a lot of glitches was it worth the wait no not at all very much a let down its a good grindy game but it doesnt feel like a sonic game but i would like to see where they go from here tho so hopefully next game is a step up this was something but not what they promised 5/10,,

"I think I've played this game enough and with enough time passed to write a solid unbiased review.

I do come from a childhood of Sonic games, growing up with SA1 and SA2 so I had high hopes for this game when it was announced, and my original playthrough back when it released I remember having fun for the most part though I felt the game was held back a lot by wonky physics and pacing issues.

In my recent run of the ""Final Horizons"" DLC/update that was released a few months ago I felt really disappointed in the overall quality and felt that it wasn't anywhere near as tested as the original. While nice to play as Tails, Knuckles and Amy again I felt like they all have their own issues such as Tails' lack of homing attack and Knuckles (recently fixed thankfully) glide delay.

The difficulty in the DLC was such a drastic step up and is another unfortunate example of games making things hard for the sake of being hard, not to issue a challenge. This game is not dark souls, nor is it as refined as dark souls and therefore shouldn't be trying to match it's difficulty in a SONIC game. The way they handled the difficulty in the DLC is more frustrating than actually challenging to the point where in the final trial you actually have to spam the same cheesey punch-stomp combo over and over to even win.

Overall a game that you can get some hours of fun out of, especially if you are a completionist like myself (though beware there are a LOT of collectables especially with the update zone.) I would highly advise waiting for a sale though as I don't think it's worth the listed price as it stands.

Tl;dr: Game has a lot of potential but unfortunately missed the mark, hopefully the sequel or next game improves. Wait for a sale.",,
W game fr fr,,
"i love sonic frontiers, it's my favorite fishing game",,
"This game is a step in the right direction for Sonic, but MAN is it the most 6/10 game I've ever played. Not in terms of it being one half bad, and one half enjoyable, but in terms of everything, and I do mean EVERYTHING, being mixed. For example, Sonic is back to controlling like in SA2, but the physics are weird, and almost non-existant. I can live with that, but you go to Cyberspace and THEN it has weird physics that's even more insufferable and tanky than Forces' controls, the graphics are trying to be nice and realistic which is interrupted by the CONSTANT pop-in, The combat is there, but it hasn't been polished properly. And the game mostly still has the trademark Sonic Jank in it. It's still a very enjoyable experience, but I don't doubt for a second that if Team Sonic keeps going in this direction (Which I hope they DO and don't change their mind on what sonic is supposed to be... AGAIN.) the next game is going to surpass this one by a mile, and finally come close to the best of sonic.

That being said, this game does not include any Furry Lapdances. 2/10.",,
"Like most games, it obviously has issues but for the standards of a Sonic game, this is something Id happily put close to the adventure games!
Controls are smooth like butter
Animation is clean, although cutscenes could still use a little work.
Everything around the bosses are freakin stellar and I hope in the next game, Sonic Team takes notes.
I think the character writing was a little too serious although I kinda understand considering the attempt to push these characters into the right direction.
All the DLC for this game is amazing and super appreciated.
The Cyberspace stages have potential but overall are really lacking.

Overall, if you look at this as a average gamer then this game is a simple few hours of fun high speed action!
Looking at it as a Sonic fan though, then compared to Sonic Forces, this is a huge step up!
I highly recommend!",,
"A modern classic.

- This game follows the boost formula started with Sonic Unleashed (a personal favorite of mine) and has tightened it for both exploration and action stages. Sonic goes fast and I couldn't be happier about how it feels to run around the Starfall Islands as Sonic.
- I never knew how well Sonic could do a more exploration-focused game but it works! Sonic's speed makes the islands big but not feel TOO big, and the obstacles are varied. The game doesn't tell you how to solve every problem, and I think it works well here, encouraging you to find many solutions or paths.
- The narrative is stronger than it's ever been, and the voice-acting is top-notch (even if it is a little jarring to hear more somber and deep delivery than previous games). I love that they give us some seeds for future adventures for the individual cast members.
- Something I only realized later is how much I appreciated that the characters included a lot of references to previous games, mentioning specific moments and adversaries. It made the Sonic universe feel bigger and like we aren't hitting the reset button every game. We know where we have been and we are moving forward.

If future Sonic games follow a similar formula I am very optimistic for future titles!",,

"the games a 9/10 in my opinion
because the game actually finally did the sonic characters right in every way, unlike the past games screwed them up so much. Also the story is so dramatic and energetic and yet the game play is so satisfying with the new controls.
Here's my only problem the cyberspace just makes me bored like the game play in sonic colours ultimate which is why i made it a 9/10. the best thing about this game though IS THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SOUNDTRACK like they didn't have to go this hard with a sonic soundtrack i never heard such good music since sonic unleashed came out in the series.
But i heavily recommend the game it's definitely one of the greatest sonic games out there and if you disagree it's fine with me.",,
"Honestly, best sonic game to ever exist. I get how people like SA1 and SA2, but to me those games are a bit too old to grab my attention. I do have to say I prefer generations when it comes to the level design as 2D cyberspace levels are exceedingly slow paced. However, the game offers the ability to wonder around at sonic speed and really enjoy the exploration part of the game. Super sonic boss fights were amazing, though I would only recommend fighting them at level 1 combat and have all skills unlocked. Wished momentum was there at the very beginning, but can't complain now that it's here. Also, last but not least, the musics for the boss fight is just astonishing. Like heavy rocks when you fight a boss is just so hype. Wished there was more content to it, but I digressed.",,

Best sonic game I will forever buy,,
"Sonic Frontiers definitely trumps in Graphics and Story. The Graphics are something I haven't seen since many other prior Sonic and even Sega games in general, and the story keeps me captivated. However, I felt as if the new Cyberspace/Koco plot was really unfamiliar. It wasn't necessarily bad; it was still outstanding. However, I reckon it would've been way better for an open-world Sonic game to be based on the typical themes such as Green Hill Zone.

Overall I'd recommend this game to others, but I'd strongly recommend they avoid playing it on The Switch or obviously a computer that can't handle it.",,
"This game was fun, after 55 hours I 100% completed everything as a casual play through. I would say this game is good for completing the main story, but not 100%. I did like how they did the side characters and so if you are not spending on the game, I would watch someone else play since I consider this one of the better sonic games.",,
